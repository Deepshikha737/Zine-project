Insects like ants, despite their limited computational resources, demonstrate remarkable abilities in navigation. Existing computational models often fall short in faithfully replicating the morphology of real insects and their interactions with the environment, hindering validation and practical application in robotics. To address these gaps, we present I2Bot, a novel simulation tool based on the morphological characteristics of desert ants. This tool empowers robotic models with dynamic sensory capabilities, realistic modeling of insect morphology, physical dynamics, and sensory capacity. By integrating gait controllers and sensory-motor loops, our approach elucidates fundamental navigation principles. By open-sourcing I2Bot, we aim to accelerate the understanding of insect intelligence and foster advances in the development of autonomous robotic systems."]},

Yet the concept of mutant p53 GOF has been challenged.  Here, using various strategies to alter the status of mutant versions of p53 in different cell lines, we demonstrate that mutant p53 stimulates cancer cell invasion in three-dimensional environments. Mechanistically, mutant p53 enhances RhoA/ROCK-dependent cell contractility and cell-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) re-organization via increasing mevalonate pathway-dependent RhoA localization to the membrane. In line with this, RhoA-dependent pro-invasive activity is also mediated by IDI-1, a mevalonate pathway product.  Further, the invasion-enhancing effect of mutant p53 is dictated by the biomechanical properties of the surrounding ECM, thereby adding a cell-independent layer of regulation to mutant p53 GOF activity that is mediated by dynamic reciprocal cell-ECM interactions. Together our findings link mutant p53 metabolic GOF activity with an invasive cellular phenotype in physiologically relevant and context-dependent settings."]},

Access to the EMR is both retrospective and prospective, allowing researchers to conduct prospective studies over time. Genetic profiling is done with population-optimized SNP arrays for the Han Chinese populations that enable genetic analyses such as genome-wide association, phenome-wide association, and polygenic risk score studies to evaluate common disease risk and pharmacogenetic response. Furthermore, the TPMI participants agree to be contacted for future research opportunities related to their genetic risks and receive personalized genetic risk profiles with health management recommendations. TPMI has established the TPMI Data Access Platform (TDAP), a central database and analysis platform that both safeguards the security of the data and facilitates academic research. The TPMI is the largest non-European cohort that merges genetic profiles with EMR in the world. With a cohort that can be followed over time, it can be utilized to validate genetic risk prediction models, conduct clinical trials to show the efficacy of risk-based health management, and optimize health policies based on genetic risks. In this report, we describe the TPMI study design, the population and genetic characteristics of the TPMI cohort, and the power it provides to conduct crucial studies in developing precision medicine on a population and personal level. As Han Chinese represent almost 20% of the world's population, the results of TPMI studies will benefit >1.4 billion people around the world and serve as a model for developing population-based precision medicine."]},

Constantly secreted into the lumen of the intestine, IgA binds commensal microbiota to regulate their colonization and function(2,3) with unclear implications for health. IgA deficiency is common in humans but is difficult to study due to its complex aetiology and comorbidities(4-8). Using genetically and environmentally controlled mice, here we show that IgA-deficient animals have increased susceptibility to endogenous colorectal tumours. Cellular and molecular analyses revealed that, in the absence of IgA, colonic epithelial cells induce antibacterial factors and accelerate cell cycling in response to the microbiota. Oral treatment with IgA was sufficient to both reduce steady-state proliferation and protect mice from tumours, but this function was due to antibody structure rather than binding specificity. In both organoid and monolayer culture systems, IgA directly suppressed epithelial growth. Co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and a targeted CRISPR screen identified DMBT1 as an IgA-binding epithelial surface protein required for IgA-mediated suppression of proliferation. Together, IgA and DMBT1 regulate Notch signalling and tune the normal cycling of absorptive colonocyte progenitors. In mice, deleting the transmembrane and cytoplasmic signalling portions of DMBT1 or blocking Notch signalling was sufficient to reverse both the increased proliferation and tumour susceptibility of IgA knockouts. These experiments establish a homeostatic function for IgA in tempering physiological epithelial responses to microbiota to maintain mucosal health."]},

Here, we identify double-unsaturated 18:2 cardiolipin as a selective inhibitor of caspase 4/11-dependent inflammatory cytokine secretion and pyroptosis, without affecting caspase-1 responses. Cardiolipin targets the CARD domain of caspase 4/11, impeding its interaction with LPS to restrain caspase 4/11 activation, thereby suppressing endotoxemia-induced systemic inflammation in vivo. Thus, we present cardiolipin as a promising candidate for preventing endotoxemia-induced sequelae in sepsis while preserving caspase-1-driven anti-microbial immune responses. By identifying cardiolipin as a specific caspase 4/11 inhibitor, we provide an urgently-needed tool for studying caspase 4/11 functions in inflammatory pathways, and open the way to studies of noncanonical inflammasome regulation by endogenous cardiolipin."]},

The analysis used HGVS nomenclature string-match comparisons to assess annotation consistency from each tool, corresponding coding impacts, and associated ACMG criteria inferred from the annotations.\nResults: The analysis revealed variable concordance rates, with 58.52% agreement for HGVSc, 84.04% for HGVSp, and 85.58% for the coding impact. SnpEff showed the highest match for HGVSc (0.988), while VEP bettered for HGVSp (0.977). The substantial discrepancies were noted in the Loss-of-Function (LoF) category. Incorrect PVS1 interpretations affected the final pathogenicity and downgraded PLP variants (ANNOVAR 55.9%, SnpEff 66.5%, VEP 67.3%), risking false negatives of clinically relevant variants in reports. \nConclusions: These findings highlight the critical challenges in accurately interpreting variant pathogenicity due to discrepancies in annotations.

To address this issue, we present a near complete genome assembly for the Jinhua pig (JH-T2T), constructed using PacBio HiFi and ONT long reads.

For outbred populations, the method called Optimum Contribution Selection (OCS) chooses parental contributions to maximize the average breeding value at a prescribed inbreeding rate. With Optimum Mate Allocation (OMA), the contribution of each mating is optimized, which allows for specific combining ability due to dominance. To enable OCS and OMA in polyploid species, new theoretical results were derived to (1) predict mid-parent heterosis due to dominance and (2) control inbreeding in a population of arbitrary ploidy. A new Convex optimization framework for OMA, named COMA, was developed and released as public software. Under stochastic simulation of a genomic selection program, COMA maintained a target inbreeding rate of 0.5% using either pedigree or genomic IBD kinship. Significantly more genetic gain was realized with pedigree kinship, which is consistent with previous studies showing the selective advantage of an individual under OCS is dominated by its Mendelian sampling term. Despite the higher accuracy (+0.2–0.3) when predicting mate performance with OMA compared to OCS, there was little long-term gain advantage. The sparsity of the COMA mating design and flexibility to incorporate mating constraints offer practical incentives over OCS. In a potato breeding case study with 170 candidates, the optimal solution at 0.5% inbreeding involved 43 parents but only 43 of the 903 possible matings."]},

Recent advances in pan-cancer research have highlighted the importance of shared oncogenic mechanisms across different cancer types, providing new avenues for therapeutic exploration. Protein kinases, particularly those involved in phagocytosis, play pivotal roles in cellular homeostasis and immune response. This study systematically examines the genetic alterations and expression profiles of protein kinases associated with phagocytosis across various cancer types, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other publicly available resources. We analyzed single nucleotide variations (SNVs), copy number variations (CNVs), methylation patterns, and mRNA expression to identify recurring alterations and their associations with survival outcomes. Our findings reveal that MET and MERTK are the most frequently mutated genes, with missense mutations dominating across cancers. CNV analysis shows significant correlations with survival in cancers like UCEC, KIRP, and KIRC, while methylation analysis indicates cancer-specific regulatory patterns affecting gene expression. Differential expression analysis highlights distinct cancer-type-specific expression profiles, with genes like MET and BTK displaying significant variation. Crosstalk pathway analysis further reveals the involvement of these kinases in key cancer-related pathways, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and apoptosis. Drug sensitivity analysis identifies potential therapeutic targets, with gene expression correlating significantly with cancer cell line responsiveness to specific compounds. These findings underscore the importance of the phagocytotic kinome in cancer biology and suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting protein kinases to enhance immune response and improve treatment outcomes."]},

Saiful", "Imraan"], "abstract": ["Systematic descriptions of the underlying interaction rules that insects use to support group and swarm flight has the potential to contribute to mathematics, biology, and robotics, including aerial swarming under sensory and computational limitations. This study analyzes 1,000 trajectories of flying honeybees in crowded conditions approaching a moving stimulus and finds how during this stimulus, honeybees coordinate flight through pairwise interactions involving a novel three-zone decision-making process. The experimental setup consists of 3-D position reconstructions via a high speed camera system recording honeybee foragers returning to a hive entrance actuated to move robotically. The analysis consists of neighborhood identification through three methods (cross-correlation, distance threshold, and average distance threshold), which reveals the dominant interaction is pairwise. The individual leader-follower pair interactions are then tested against three regulation candidates: optic flow, relative velocity, and optical expansion rate, based on minimizing root mean square error. The results show that each follower demonstrates a three stage process involving a feedback rule change, linked by an intermediate observation/decision phase. During the initial “lock” phase, an insect maintains a consistent optical expansion rate until inter-agent distance closes to 10 cm. The regulation candidates then undergo large variations during a relatively long observation/decision zone, with 1.04 seconds being the average time in the decision zone. 79% of the paired insect entries into the decision zone result in subsequent re-engagement to track the same initial leader, while 21% result in disengagement from the group behavior. Visual regulation candidate comparison in the third stage indicates that upon re-engagement, the follower relative velocity is regulated to provide consistent velocity matching between agents. The third stage’s velocity tracking is consistent with a closed-loop feedback proportional-integral (PI) controller regulating velocity tracking error. Across the insect population studied, the proportional gain remained showed minimal variability over individuals, a derivative gain was considered and found negligible, and the integral gain varied by individual. Collectively, these findings underscore the existence of an alternative swarm architecture, highlighting individual decision-making capabilities, feedback regulation target changes, and the presence of reactive, deliberative, and moderate (PI control) timescale interaction rules contained within aerial groups."]},

Our analysis reveals a new factor, the cross-scale reproductive number of a mutant virion, that quantifies how quickly mutant strains increase in frequency when they initially appear in the infected host population. This cross-scale reproductive number combines with viral mutation rates, single-strain reproductive numbers, and transmission bottleneck width to determine the likelihood of evolutionary emergence, and whether evolution occurs swiftly or gradually within chains of transmission. We find that wider transmission bottlenecks facilitate emergence of pathogens with short-term infections, but hinder emergence of pathogens exhibiting cross-scale selective conflict and long-term infections.

This diverse sampling is required to build a robust understanding of the genomic basis of complex traits and diseases as well as human evolution, and to ensure that all people benefit from downstream scientific discoveries. While previous work has characterized compositional biases and disparities for public genome-wide association (GWAS), microbiome, and epigenomic studies, we currently lack a comprehensive understanding of the degree of bias for transcriptomic studies. To address this gap, we analyzed the metadata for RNA-seq studies from two public databases—the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), representing 795,071 samples from 21,209 studies, and the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP), representing 167,389 samples from 649 studies. We also randomly selected 620 studies from SRA for detailed, manual evaluation. We found that 3% of samples in SRA and 21% of individuals described in the literature had population descriptors (race, ethnicity, or ancestry); 28% of samples in dbGaP had paired genotype data that was used to empirically infer ancestry. In SRA, dbGaP, and the literature, race, ethnicity, and ancestry terms were frequently conflated and difficult to disambiguate. After standardizing population descriptors, we observed many clear biases: for example, among samples in SRA that were coded using US Census terms, 69.0% came from white donors, corresponding to an 1.2x overrepresentation of this group relative to the US population. Among samples in SRA coded using continental ancestry labels, 55.6% came from European ancestry donors—an 4.1x overrepresentation of this group relative to the global population. These biases were generally similar across datasets (SRA, dbGaP, literature review), and were comparable to previous reports for other ‘omics data types. However, we note that, relative to other ‘omics data subsets like GWAS, there is considerably less information, of arguably worse quality, about who is participating in RNA-seq studies. Together, these results demonstrate a critical need to improve our thoughtfulness, consistency, and effort around reporting population descriptors in RNA-seq studies, and to more generally strive for greater diversity in this important data type."]},

Transcription and other processes may generate and be regulated by torsional stress. In the genome, the interplay of these processes creates complicated patterns of both positive (+) and negative (-) torsion. However, a challenge in generating an accurate torsion map is determining the zero-torsion baseline signal, which is conflated with chromatin accessibility. Here, we introduce a high-resolution method based on the intercalator trimethylpsoralen (TMP) to address this challenge. We describe a method to establish the zero-torsion baseline while preserving the chromatin state of the genome. This approach enables both high-resolution mapping of accessibility and torsional stress in chromatin in the cell. Our analysis reveals transcription-generated torsional domains consistent with the twin-supercoiled-domain model of transcription and suggests a role for torsional stress in recruiting topoisomerases and in regulating 3D genome architecture via cohesin. This new method provides a potential path forward for using TMP to measure torsional stress in the genome without the confounding contribution of accessibility in chromatin."]},

Work by us and others has shown that the choice of these synonymous codon is not random, and carries regulatory and functional consequences. Existing protein foundation models ignore this context-dependent role of coding sequence in shaping the protein landscape of the cell. To address this gap, we introduce cdsFM, a suite of codon-resolution large language models, including both EnCodon and DeCodon models, with up to 1B parameters. Pre-trained on 60 million protein-coding sequences from more than 5,000 species, our models effectively learn the relationship between codons and amino acids, recapitualing the overall structure of the genetic code. In addition to outperforming state-of-the-art genomic foundation models in a variety of zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks, the larger pre-trained models were superior in predicting the choice of synonymous codons. To systematically assess the impact of synonymous codon choices on protein expression and our models’ ability to capture these effects, we generated a large dataset measuring overall and surface expression levels of three proteins as a function of changes in their synonymous codons. We showed that our EnCodon models could be readily fine-tuned to predict the contextual consequences of synonymous codon choices. Armed with this knowledge, we applied EnCodon to existing clinical datasets of synonymous variants, and we identified a large number of synonymous codons that are likely pathogenic, several of which we experimentally confirmed in a cellbased model. Together, our findings establish the cdsFM suite as a powerful tool for decoding the complex functional grammar underlying the choice of synonymous codons."]},

Using two different technologies increases the cost and the required amount of genomic DNA. Here, we show that comparable results are possible using error correction of ultra-long ONT Simplex reads and then assembling them using state-of-the-art de novo assembly methods. To achieve this, we have developed the deep learning-based HERRO framework, which corrects ONT Simplex reads while carefully preserving differences in related genomic sequences. Taking into account informative positions that differentiate the haplotypes or genomic repeat copies, HERRO achieves an increase of read accuracy of up to 100-fold for diploid human genomes. By combining HERRO with Verkko assembler, we achieve high contiguity on several human genomes by reconstructing many chromosomes telomere-to-telomere, including chromosomes X and Y. HERRO supports both R9.4.1 and R10.4.1 ONT Simplex reads and generalizes well to other species. These results provide an opportunity to reduce the cost of genome sequencing and use corrected ONT reads to analyze more complex genomes with different levels of ploidy or even aneuploidy."]},

Addressing this issue, which produces zero-inflated count data, is crucial for many downstream data analyses including the inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). In this paper, we introduce two novel contributions. First, we propose Dropout Augmentation (DA), a simple but effective model regularization method to address the zero inflation problem in single-cell data by augmenting the data with synthetic dropout events. DA offers a new perspective to solve the \"dropout\" problem beyond imputation. Second, we present DAZZLE, a stabilized and robust version of the autoencoder-based structure equation model for GRN inference using the DA concept. Benchmark experiments illustrate the improved performance and increased stability of the proposed DAZZLE model over existing approaches. The practical application of the DAZZLE model on a longitudinal mouse microglia dataset containing over 15,000 genes illustrates its ability to handle real-world single cell data with minimal gene filtration. The improved robustness and stability of DAZZLE make it a practical and valuable addition to the toolkit for GRN inference from single-cell data.

The catecholamine isoproterenol induced both analog hypertrophy and digital apoptosis. While high-dose isoproterenol induced mixed hypertrophy and apoptosis at the population level, we found that individual cells that hypertrophy are more likely to survive. Likewise, phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy was associated with survival at the single-cell level.  Inhibiting caspase-3 reduced apoptosis and increased a cell likelihood of hypertrophy. Multinomial log-linear models demonstrate that a cell initial size and DNA content predict its susceptibility to hypertrophy or apoptosis.

However, the mechanisms of evolving antimicrobial resistance in such polymicrobial environments are poorly understood. We previously reported that magnesium depletion caused by the fungus Candida albicans can enable Pseudomonas aeruginosa to acquire significant resistance to colistin, a last-resort antibiotic targeting bacterial membrane. Here, we dissect the genetic and biochemical basis of this increased colistin resistance. We show that P. aeruginosa cells can acquire colistin resistance using three distinct evolutionary trajectories involving mutations in genes involved in lipid A biosynthesis, lipid A modifications that are dependent on low Mg2+, and a putative Mg2+ transporter, PA4824. These mutations confer colistin resistance by altering acyl chains, hydroxylation, and aminoarabinose modification of lipid A moieties on the bacterial outer membrane. In all cases, enhanced colistin resistance initially depends on the low Mg2+-responsive PhoPQ pathway, which potentiates the evolution of resistance mutations and lipid A modifications that do not occur without Mg2+ depletion. However, the PhoPQ pathway is not required to maintain high colistin resistance in all cases. In most cases, the genetic and biochemical changes associated with these novel forms of colistin resistance also impair bacterial membrane integrity, leading to fitness costs. Our findings provide molecular insights into how nutritional competition drives a novel antibiotic resistance mechanism and its ensuing fitness tradeoffs."]},

Epimutations mediated by RNA interference (RNAi) and/or chromatin modifications can confer antifungal drug resistance and may impact virulence traits in fungi. However, whether these epigenetic modifications can be transmitted across generations following sexual reproduction was unclear. This study demonstrates that RNAi epimutations conferring antifungal drug resistance are transgenerationally inherited in the human fungal pathogen Mucor circinelloides. Our research reveals that RNAi-based antifungal resistance follows a DNA sequence-independent, non-Mendelian inheritance pattern. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are the exclusive determinants of inheritance, transmitting drug resistance independently of other known repressive epigenetic modifications. Unique sRNA signature patterns can be traced through inheritance from parent to progeny, further supporting RNA as an alternative molecule for transmitting information across generations. This study marks a significant advance in understanding epigenetic inheritance, highlighting RNAi-exclusive epimutations as a widespread phenomenon in the pathogenic M. circinelloides species complex. Understanding how epimutations occur, propagate, and confer resistance may enable their detection in other eukaryotic pathogens, provide solutions for challenges posed by rising antimicrobial drug resistance (AMR), and also advance research on phenotypic adaptability and its evolutionary implications."]},

However, marked impairments in threat extinction learning coupled with impaired neuroplasticity in patients strongly impede the efficacy of exposure-based interventions. Recent translational research suggests a role of the renin-angiotensin (RA) system in both these processes. However, the efficacy of pharmacological modulation of the RA system to enhance threat extinction in humans and the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. The present pre-registered, randomized placebo-controlled pharmacological neuroimaging trial demonstrates that pre-extinction administration of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan accelerated attenuation of the psychophysiological threat response during extinction. On the neural level the acceleration of extinction was accompanied by threat-signal specific enhanced ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation and its coupling with the basolateral amygdala. Multivoxel pattern analysis and voxel-wise mediation analysis further revealed that that losartan reduced the neural threat expression, particularly in the vmPFC, and confirmed that acceleration of extinction critically involved treatment-induced modulation of vmPFC activation. Overall the results provide the first evidence for a pivotal role of the RA system in extinction learning in humans and suggest that adjunct losartan administration can be leveraged to facilitate the efficacy of extinction-based therapies."]},

Our approach generates precise deletions using a CRISPR library framework that is free from constraints of gRNA target site availability and efficacy. We applied our method to AcrIIA4, a phage-encoded anti-CRISPR protein that robustly inhibits SpCas9. Extensive structural characterization has shown that AcrIIA4 physically occupies the DNA-binding interfaces of several SpCas9 domains; nonetheless, the importance of each AcrIIA4 interaction for SpCas9 inhibition is unknown. We used our approach to determine the essential and dispensable regions of AcrIIA4. Surprisingly, not all contacts with SpCas9 were required, and in particular, we found that the AcrIIA4 loop that inserts into SpCas9’s RuvC catalytic domain can be deleted. Our results show that AcrIIA4 inhibits SpCas9 primarily by blocking PAM binding, and that its interaction with the SpCas9 catalytic domain is inessential."]},

How aggressive breast tumors recruit neutrophils remains undefined. Here, we investigated the roles of TGF-β1 and TNF-α in the regulation of neutrophil recruitment by breast cancer cells. TGF-β1 and TNF-α are pro-inflammatory factors upregulated in breast tumors and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT), a process linked to cancer cell aggressiveness. We report that, as expected, dual treatment with TGF-β1 and TNF-α induces EMT signatures in premalignant M2 cells, which are part of the MCF10A breast cancer progression model. Conditioned media (CM) harvested from M2 cells treated with TGF-β1/TNF-α gives rise to amplified neutrophil chemotaxis compared to CM from control M2 cells. This response correlates with higher levels of the neutrophil chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL8 and is significantly attenuated in the presence of a CXCL8-neutralizing antibody. Furthermore, we found that secretion of CXCL1 and CXCL8 from treated M2 cells depends on p38MAPK activity. By combining gene editing, immunological and biochemical approaches, we show that the regulation of neutrophil recruitment and EMT signatures are not mechanistically linked in treated M2 cells. Finally, analysis of publicly available cancer cell line transcriptomic databases revealed a significant correlation between CXCL8 and TGF-β1/TNF-α-regulated or effector genes in breast cancer.

We show that younger tumors exhibit hallmarks of aggressiveness, such as increased proliferation and genomic instability, whereas older tumors are characterized by elevated immune infiltration, indicative of enhanced immune surveillance. These findings suggest that the clock captures a tumor’s effective growth rate resulting from the evolutionary-ecological competition between intrinsic growth potential and external systemic pressures. Because of the clock’s ability to delineate old and stable from young and aggressive tumors, it has potential applications in risk stratification of early-stage breast cancers and guiding early detection efforts."]},

Understanding the quantitative association between antibiotic use and resulting resistance is important for predicting future rates of antibiotic resistance and for designing antibiotic stewardship policy. However, the use-resistance association is complicated by “spillover”, in which one population’s level of antibiotic use affects another population’s level of resistance via the transmission of bacteria between those populations. Spillover is known to have effects at the level of families and hospitals, but it is unclear if spillover is relevant at larger scales. We used mathematical modeling and analysis of observational data to address this question. First, we used dynamical models of antibiotic resistance to predict the effects of spillover. Whereas populations completely isolated from one another do not experience any spillover, we found that if even 1% of interactions are between populations, then spillover may have large consequences: the effect of a change in antibiotic use in one population on antibiotic resistance in that population could be reduced by as much as 50%. Then, we quantified spillover in observational antibiotic use and resistance data from US states and European countries for 3 pathogen-antibiotic combinations, finding that increased interactions between populations were associated with smaller differences in antibiotic resistance between those populations. Thus, spillover may have an important impact at the level of states and countries, which has ramifications for predicting the future of antibiotic resistance, designing antibiotic resistance stewardship policy, and interpreting stewardship interventions."]},

Using ", " Ca", " imaging and optogenetic manipulations, we found that infralimbic (IL) neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens shell (IL", ") neurons store consolidated social memory.

Furthermore, inactivating hippocampal ventral CA1 neurons projecting to the IL disrupted the consolidation of memory for newly familiarized mice while sparing the recognition of littermates. These findings demonstrate the critical role of hippocampal-cortical interactions in the consolidation of social memory."]},

Previous empirical studies of consonance have used common, familiar chords, making it harder to separate the effect of acoustic features from familiarity. Here we explored consonance perception in an unfamiliar, non-standardly tuned 0-5-10 trichord. A test was conducted in which 100 musicians and 100 nonmusicians compared the consonance of an original, non-standard, 0-5-10 chord and an adapted version, in which the lowest, middle or upper note was raised or lowered with 25 or 50 cents. According to a model based on continuous acoustic features, any adaptation to a 0-5-10 chord should yield a comparable decrease in consonance. We indeed found a general consonance decrease, but this was stronger for adaptations enlarging the distance between the lowest and the upper note, i.e. lowering the lowest or raising the highest note, than for other adaptations. These results deviate from the model’s predictions and from patterns observed in standard, more familiar chords. Future research should examine the generalizability of these findings to other chords than the 0-5-10 trichord."]},

Behavioural observations were conducted on individuals from two zoo-housed colonies. We found isochronous rhythms in vocal (e.g. pants, grunts and hoots), as well as in motoric (e.g. swaying and stomping) behavioural sequences. Among individuals, variation was found in the duration between onsets of behavioural elements, resulting in individual-specific tempi. Despite this variation in individual tempi, display sequences were consistently structured with stable, isochronous rhythms. Overall, directed displays, targeted at specific individuals, were less isochronous than undirected displays. The presence of rhythmic patterns across two independent colonies of chimpanzees, suggests that underlying mechanisms for rhythm production may be shared between humans and non-human primates. This shared mechanism indicates that the cognitive requirements for rhythm production potentially preceded human music and language evolution."]},

Recent studies have indicated that diabetes (T1DM) exacerbates the outcomes of TBI, leading to more severe cognitive deficits and increased risk of complications. This study investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for T1DM-associated TBI. Four mRNA datasets (GSE4745, GSE125451, GSE173975, and GSE80174) downloaded from GEO repository were used in this study. Using limma, a total of 284 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in T1DM, of which 11 were upregulated and 9 were downregulated. GSEA showed that these DEGs were significantly enriched in cell communication, lipid metabolic process, and PPAR signaling. A total of 584 DEGs were identified in TBI, of which 186 were upregulated and 9 were downregulated. GSEA showed that these DEGs were mainly enriched in immune response-regulating signaling pathway. WGCNA identified 122 significant genes in TIDM-related modules and 368 significant genes in TBI-related module. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that T1DM module genes were significantly correlated with lipid metabolic process and ribosome biogenesis, while TBI module genes were significantly correlated with inflammation and immune response, including leukocyte mediated immunity, lymphocyte mediated immunity, and cytokine mediated receptor activity. PPI network analysis of T1DM module genes identified 20 hub genes, including 14 ribosomal genes: Rpl23, Rps3a, Rps6, Rpl5, Rpl17, Rps24, Rpl23a, Rps4x, Rpl9, Rps15a14, Rpl30, Rpl31, Rps25, and Rps27a-2. The hub genes were primarily related to ribosome biogenesis and RNA post-transcriptional regulation. PPI network analysis of TBI module genes identified 20 hub genes: Ptprc, Tp53, Stat1, Stat3, Tyrobp, Itgad, Csf1r, Itgb2, Rac2, Icam1, Myd88, Cd44, Vav1, Aif1, C1qa, Laptm5, B2m, Fcer1g, and Lyn. The hub genes were primarily related to inflammatory mediators and immune response. Based on the overlap of T1DM module genes and TBI module genes, Cmklr1, Mgst1, and Plin2, were identified as key genes of T1DM-associated TBI. Functional enrichment analysis showed that they were primarily enriched in the cellular response to hydroperoxide, cytokine-mediated receptor signaling activity, regulation of sequestering of triglyceride, negative regulation of IL-12 production, and positive regulation of macrophage chemotaxis. Using Reactome, Cmklr1, Mgst1, and Plin2 were related to cytokine signaling activity, neutrophil degranulation, and lipid storage, respectively. We concluded that Lipid droplet dysregulation and Neuroinflammation are the potential molecular mechanisms of T1DM-associated TBI. Cmklr1, Mgst1, and Plin2 are positively correlated with T1DM-associated TBI and may be important biomarkers and potential treatment targets for diabetic TBI."]},

Thus, they lack the ability to perform these tasks at the resolution of specific cell types or states across diverse tissue and disease contexts. To address this gap, we present Decima, a model that predicts the cell type- and condition- specific expression of a gene from its surrounding DNA sequence. Decima is trained on single-cell or single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from over 22 million cells, and successfully predicts the cell type-specific expression of unseen genes based on their sequence alone.

Following a cross-over, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled design (pre-registration: ACTRN12611000669998), participants completed two 2-week blocks of fellow fixing eye patching. One block combined patching with citalopram (20 mg/day) and the other with a placebo tablet. The blocks were separated by a 2-week washout period. The primary outcome was change in amblyopic eye visual acuity. Secondary outcomes included stereoacuity and electrophysiological measures of retinal and cortical function. Seven participants were randomized, fewer than our pre-specified sample size of 20. There were no statistically significant differences in amblyopic eye visual acuity change between the active (mean ± SD change = 0.08±0.16 logMAR) and the placebo (mean change = −0.01±0.03 logMAR) blocks. No treatment effects were observed for any secondary outcomes. However, 3 of 7 participants experienced a 0.1 logMAR or greater improvement in amblyopic eye visual acuity in the active but not the placebo block.

LUNA improves the focusing precision down to 3 nm and extends the focusing range to at least 40 times the objective depth-of-focus. These advancements enable us to investigate how bacteria adapt to temperature change at the single-cell level, revealing a series of novel insights into bacterial cold shock response mechanisms. This approach addresses the complexities of growth dynamics, growth mode transition, division synchronization, and size regulation during the adaptation period, which present significant challenges for traditional analytical methods. Notably, the controversies between the growth lag of batch culture and continuous growth at the single-cell level are successfully explained based on scattering theory.

However, it remains elusive which RLR is involved in sensing the PAMPs of Dengue virus (DENV), an important RNA virus causing serious human diseases, and the molecular basis of the DENV PAMPs is poorly defined.

Oral administration of activated carbon and dandelion decreased the body weight gain in both high-fat diet (HFD) GK rats and Wistar rats.

Oral administration of activated carbon resulted in metabolic changes and anti-inflammatory effects that decreased both high-fat diet-induced obesity and diabetes. The beneficial effects of increased positive responders are related to improved carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, regulated inflammatory mediators, with simultaneous reduction of detrimental compounds such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis and modification of the gut microbiome.

We purified the minimal replication complex, comprising nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8, and combined it with fluorescently labelled RNA substrates, enabling real-time monitoring of RNA primer elongation at the single-molecule level. This platform allowed us to investigate the mechanisms of action of key inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication.

Since 2007, ASF has been expanding globally and caused severe disruption to the global swine industry. In 2021, ASF was detected in the Dominican Republic, prompting an emergency response from local and international officials. Nearly three years later, ASF is still present in the country despite control efforts. This study used data from January 2023-March 2024 from government-mandated sampling of commercial farms, a newly initiated active surveillance program of backyard farms, and passive reports to provide a comprehensive and descriptive assessment of ASF in the Dominican Republic. The attack rate for each region was calculated, and the reproductive ratio (R0) was estimated using the doubling time method. ASF continues to be distributed throughout the Dominican Republic with lower attack rates in central regions and R0 nearing 1. These results suggest that ASF in the country is reaching a stable state that does not resemble an epidemic situation. This may suggest the need to change from an approach of emergency response to one of sustained and progressive control, ultimately for the long-term goal of ASF eradication in the Dominican Republic."]},

We aimed to identify its cellular source in synovial tissue from patients with Axial SpA (AxSpA) and Psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Methods: Synovial tissue from patients with SpA was profiled using single-cell RNA sequencing(scRNA-seq: AxSpA, n=5 and PsA, n=6) or spatial RNA profiling (PsA, n=4). CellPhoneDB was used to infer cell-cell communication. Tissue resident memory Th17 (TRM17)-like cells were generated in vitro using blood memory CD4+ T cells from SpA patients. An epigenetic inhibitor library, siRNA and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) were used to identify epigenetic regulator(s) for TRM17. Results: scRNA-seq showed that IL-17A expression in SpA synovium was restricted to CD4+CXCR6+ TRM17 cells. Cell-cell communication and single-cell spatial analysis support the interaction between TRM17 and CLEC10A+ dendritic cells, which were activated in SpA. Both sublining and lining fibroblasts in SpA synovium exhibited an enhanced IL-17A response signature. TRM17-like cells generated in vitro phenocopied the TRM17 found in joint tissue and produced IL-17A in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation but not cytokines. IL-23 enhanced TCR-mediated IL-17F and IFN-gamma; but not IL-17A production. Perturbation of BRD1 inhibited the generation of TRM17-like cells. Conclusions: CD4+ TRM17 cells are the predominant source of IL-17A in SpA. The TCR stimulation is essential for the secretion of IL-17A by TRM17-like cells. The epigenetic regulator BRD1 contributes to the generation of TRM17. Depleting TRM17 cells in SpA is a therapeutic strategy with potential to induce longterm remission."]},

Nineteen T cell subsets were correlated with WOMAC pain. Notably, we found a negative correlation of cell subsets associated with Treg expansion and activation (FoxP3+CTLA4+, CD4+CD57+, Treg CD95+, CD4 Treg CD45RA-). Differential gene expression analysis between patients with low and high WOMAC pain intensity (threshold of 40/100) revealed an upregulation of inflammasome-related genes such as IL1RL1, IL31RA, IFITM3, NLRP3, IFNG in Tregs. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted an overrepresentation of innate immune response, IL-8, and interferon activation pathways suggesting a pro-inflammatory state in Tregs of patients with high pain intensity.

We demonstrated a direct disruption of both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity in vitro when expression of nsGSLs was upregulated on established target cells. It remains unclear however, whether in vivo nsGSLs play an active role in tumor development and can aid tumors in evading immune responses. To investigate whether nsGSLs facilitate tumor progression in vivo, we first established a murine model system using MC38-OVA cell lines with varying cell surface levels of nsGSLs. In vitro analysis revealed reduced MHC-I accessibility on tumor cells with elevated nsGSLs profiles, leading to diminished activation of OVA-specific OT-I T cells as evidenced by decreased expression of CD25, CD69, and production of IFNg, which subsequently resulted in decreased tumor cell death. Subsequent in vivo experiments investigating tumor outgrowth after engraftment of subcutaneously injected MC38-OVA cell lines with low or high cell surface levels of nsGSLs demonstrated better growth of nsGSL-rich tumor cells compared to nsGSL-poor tumors which could be controlled. Together these results suggest that nsGSLs expressed by tumors can facilitate immune evasion and subsequent tumor progression.

Classical sequence alignment algorithms are based on dynamic programming and often require quadratic time and memory with respect to the sequence length. As a result, classic sequence alignment algorithms fail to scale with increasing sequence lengths and quickly become memory-bound due to data-movement penalties. Results: Processing-In-Memory (PIM) is an emerging architectural paradigm that seeks to accelerate memory-bound algorithms by bringing computation closer to the data to mitigate data-movement penalties. This work presents BIMSA (Bidirectional In-Memory Sequence Alignment), a PIM-optimized implementation of the state-of-the-art sequence alignment algorithm BiWFA (Bidirectional Wavefront Alignment), incorporating hardware-aware optimizations for a production-ready PIM architecture (UPMEM). BIMSA achieves speedups up to 22.24x (11.95x on average) compared to state-of-the-art PIM-enabled implementations of sequence alignment algorithms, and supports aligning sequences of thousands of bases, exceeding the limitations of current PIM-accelerated implementations. BIMSA also achieves speedups up to 5.84x (2.83x on average) compared to the most efficient multicore CPU implementation of BiWFA. Most notably, BIMSA exhibits linear scalability with the number of compute units, enabling further performance improvements with upcoming PIM architectures equipped with more compute units and achieving speedups up to 9.56x (4.7x on average)."]},

Sequence-to-function models such as SpliceAI support discovery of splice altering variants but filtering their output to identify pathogenic mutations remains challenging. We developed SpliPath to address 2 unmet needs in this process. First, SpliPath links the output of SpliceAI with reference transcriptomics data. This allows users to identify genetic variants that induce unannotated splice isoforms selectively expressed in disease models or patient tissue. Second, SpliPath aggregates variants with similar functional consequences into collapsed splicing quantitative trait loci (csQTLs) for more powerful genetic association analyses. We first used SpliPath to annotate whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 9,467 ALS patients and controls using RNAseq data from an iPSC model of TDP-43 dysfunction. Through this, SpliPath identified 53 variants predicted to enhance cryptic exon (CE) retention events associated with a core ALS pathomechanism. We then applied SpliPath to 294 ALS patients where both WGS and RNAseq were available and discovered missing genetic risk in the known ALS gene KIF5A. This revealed a first of kind intronic mutation hotspot that was validated using minigene reporter assays. Finally, using the same RNAseq data we then predicted 754 candidate csQTL for an independent WGS cohort of 6,625 ALS patients and 2,472 controls. Unbiased genomewide csQTL association testing successfully recovered KIF5A and nominated EPG5 as a potential pathogenic gene. These effects were undetectable using simplistic SpliceAI gene burden tests. Collectively, our study demonstrates the utility of SpliPath for uncovering missing heritability in rare disorders."]},

Specifically, we first pre-train drug and protein embeddings to capture their semantic information. This semantic information is then leveraged to guide a meta-path-based random walk on the biological heterogeneous network, generating sequences of interactions. These sequences are used to compute embedding features via a heterogeneous skip-gram model, which are subsequently fed into downstream tasks to predict DTIs.\nSGMDTI achieves substantial performance improvement over other state-of-the-art methods for drug-target interaction prediction. Moreover, it excels in the cold-start scenario, which is often a challenging case in DTI prediction.

Antibodies were classified as successful or unsuccessful based on standardized validation experiments, and the structural and functional properties of their immunogens were analysed. Results indicated that longer immunogens often resulted in more successful but less specific antibodies. Shorter immunogens (50 residues or fewer) with disordered or unfolded regions at the N- or C-terminus and long coil stretches were more likely to generate successful antibodies.

Our models recapitulate known associations between histone PTMs and expression patterns, including predicting that acetylation of histone subunit H3 lysine residue 27 (H3K27ac) near the transcription start site (TSS) significantly increases expression levels. To validate this prediction experimentally and investigate how natural vs. engineered deposition of H3K27ac might differentially affect expression, we apply the synthetic dCas9-p300 histone acetyltransferase system to 8 genes in the HEK293T cell line and to 5 genes in the K562 cell line. Further, to facilitate model building, we perform MNase-seq to map genome-wide nucleosome occupancy levels in HEK293T. We observe that our models perform well in accurately ranking relative fold-changes among genes in response to the dCas9-p300 system; however, their ability to rank fold-changes within individual genes is noticeably diminished compared to predicting expression across cell types from their native epigenetic signatures. Our findings highlight the need for more comprehensive genome-scale epigenome editing datasets, better understanding of the actual modifications made by epigenome editing tools, and improved causal models that transfer better from endogenous cellular measurements to perturbation experiments.

Here, we study theoretically and experimentally the evolution of mutation rates in proofreading polymerases with orthogonal control of direct and indirect selection. Mutagenic DNA polymerases enjoy a long-time fitness advantage by enhancing the rate of acquiring beneficial mutations. However, this is offset by a short-time fitness penalty, which we trace to a counterintuitive trade-off between mutation rates and activity in proofreading polymerases. Since these fitness effects act on different timescales, no one number characterizes the fitness of a mutator allele. We find unusual dynamic features in the resulting evolutionary dynamics, such as kinetic exclusion, selection by dynamic environments, and Rock-Paper-Scissors dynamics in the absence of ecology. Our work has implications for the evolution of mutation rates and more broadly, evolution in the context of an anti-correlation between mutation rates and short term fitness."]},

For organisms amenable to controlled crosses, the increased fitness of progeny from between- relative to within-population crosses (heterosis) provides a useful tool to infer historical fixation of partly recessive deleterious alleles by drift and/or bottlenecks. Additionally, heterosis may also provide a unique benefit in regional admixture provenancing for restorations of rare plant species, but empirical data to directly test this idea is lacking.\nMethods\nWe quantified heterosis in crosses between small remnant populations of a rare prairie forb (Silene regia Sims). We measured early fitness components (seed number per fruit, germination, and juvenile survival) in a controlled environment. Adult fitness components (survival and reproduction) were quantified over two flowering seasons in two different environments, a field common garden simulating the initial stages of a restoration, and a greenhouse. To our knowledge, our study is the first to estimate cumulative fitness for a rare species in conditions of a newly established restoration in the field. Additionally, we provide a unique comparison of heterosis estimated under controlled vs. field conditions.\nKey Results\nThe consequences of between-population crosses for cumulative fitness in the field were strongly positive in two of the populations (132-292% heterosis) and neutral in a third. Heterosis was generally stronger when measured under field conditions and was more likely to be detected for adult fitness components.\nConclusions\nRegional admixture provenancing in restorations should be beneficial for this species. We advocate for more research on heterosis in rare species, particularly in restorations. Such restorations can be opportunities for experimental genetics in addition to reestablishing important ecosystem services."]},

However, despite their central role in evolution little is known about the factors that contribute to the structure, size, formation rate, and fitness effects of adaptive CNVs. Local genomic sequences are likely to be an important determinant of these properties. Whereas it is known that point mutation rates vary with genomic location and local DNA sequence features, the role of genome architecture in the formation, selection, and the resulting evolutionary dynamics of CNVs is poorly understood. Previously, we have found that the GAP1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes frequent and repeated amplification and selection under long-term experimental evolution in glutamine-limiting conditions. The GAP1 gene has a unique genomic architecture consisting of two flanking long terminal repeats (LTRs) and a proximate origin of DNA replication (autonomously replicating sequence, ARS), which are likely to promote rapid GAP1 CNV formation. To test the role of these genomic elements on CNV-mediated adaptive evolution, we performed experimental evolution in glutamine-limited chemostats using engineered strains lacking either the adjacent LTRs, ARS, or all elements. Using a CNV reporter system and neural network simulation-based inference (nnSBI) we quantified the formation rate and fitness effect of CNVs for each strain. We find that although GAP1 CNVs repeatedly form and sweep to high frequency in strains with modified genome architecture, removal of local DNA elements significantly impacts the rate and fitness effect of CNVs and the rate of adaptation. We performed genome sequence analysis to define the molecular mechanisms of CNV formation for 177 CNV lineages. We find that across all four strain backgrounds, between 26% and 80% of all GAP1 CNVs are mediated by Origin Dependent Inverted Repeat Amplification (ODIRA) which results from template switching between the leading and lagging strand during DNA synthesis. In the absence of the local ARS, a distal ARS can mediate CNV formation via ODIRA. In the absence of local LTRs, homologous recombination mechanisms still mediate gene amplification following de novo insertion of retrotransposon elements at the locus. Our study demonstrates the remarkable plasticity of the genome and reveals that template switching during DNA replication is a frequent source of adaptive CNVs."]},

This study explores the extent of sY misidentification within the human phosphoproteome by distinguishing between sulfation and phosphorylation based on their mass difference. Using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), we screened ~45M peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) from the PeptideAtlas Human Phosphoproteome build for peptidoforms with mass error shifts indicative of sulfation. This analysis pinpointed 104 candidate sulfated peptidoforms, backed-up by Gene Ontology (GO) terms and custom terms linked to sulfation. False positive filtering by manual annotation resulted in 31 convincing peptidoforms spanning 7 known and 7 novel sY sites. Y47 in Calumenin was particularly intriguing since mass error shifts, acidic motif conservation, and MS2 neutral loss patterns characteristic of sulfation, but not phosphorylation, provided strong evidence that this site can only be sulfated. Overall, although misidentification of sulfation in phosphoproteomics datasets derived from cell and tissue intracellular extracts can occur, it appears relatively rare and should not be considered a confounding factor for high-quality phosphoproteomics studies."]},

We analyzed 192 accessions from 83 natural populations, revealing a 128 Mb range in genome size. Plastome haplotype analysis identified a haplogroup that shifted niches to tropics and evolved larger genomes. A strong correlation was found between larger genomes and tropical habitats characterized by higher temperatures and lower seasonality. Genomic repeat content, particularly 45S rDNA and Ty1-copia transposable elements, was associated with larger genomes. Reciprocal transplantation experiments confirmed the adaptive nature of large genomes in tropical environments, with individuals exhibiting lower growth rates but higher fecundity.

In this study, we investigate how gene deletions compensating for a defect in the polarity pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae impact the fitness landscape. Using a transposon mutagenesis screen, we demonstrate that gene fitness has changed on a genome-wide scale in the compensated strain. An analysis of the functional associations between the affected genes reveals that compensation impacts cellular processes that have no clear connection to cell polarity. Moreover, genes belonging to the same process tend to show the same direction of gene fitness change, indicating that compensation rewires the fitness contribution of cellular processes rather than of individual genes. In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that functional overlap between modules and the interconnectedness of the molecular interaction network play major roles in mediating compensatory evolution."]},

The unique insights gained from a genome-level perspective have revealed a striking pattern of conserved macrosynteny within chromosomes across huge phylogenetic distances in animals, yet progress in many lineages has been hampered by the absence of genome-level data. Here, we show that the tectonics of genome evolution in clitellates, a clade composed of most freshwater and all terrestrial species of the phylum Annelida, is characterised by extensive genome-wide scrambling that resulted in a massive loss of macrosynteny between marine annelids and clitellates, to the point that ancient bilaterian linkage groups (ie, groups of genes inherited as a block in most bilaterian phyla) are fully disrupted. These massive rearrangements included the formation of putative neocentromeres with newly acquired transposable elements, and preceded a further period of genome-wide reshaping events including whole-genome duplications and massive macrosyntenic reshuffling between clitellate lineages, potentially triggered by the loss of genes involved in genome stability and homeostasis of cell division. Notably, while these rearrangements broke short-range interactions observed between Hox genes in marine annelids, they were reformed as long-range interactions in clitellates. These genomic rearrangements led to the relocation of genes and the formation of new chimeric genetic elements, both of which may have contributed to the adaptation of clitellates to freshwater and terrestrial environments. Our findings provide evidence of a massive genomic reshaping within clitellates at 2D and 3D levels, and suggest that synteny may not limit the structural evolution of this animal lineage. Our study thus suggests that the genomic landscape of Clitellata resulted from a rare burst of genomic changes that ended a long period of stability that persists across large phylogenetic distances."]},

We found weak stabilizing selection on wing shape in both sexes, and no evidence that selection on this trait differed between the species. In contrast, selection on body size was curvilinear in males and directional in females, and they differed in form (males) and intensity (females) between these two species. By analyzing selection on the fine-grained spatial scale, we found that selection on male body size was shaped by the local mating system, and the relationship between mating system characteristics and directional selection was remarkably consistent across these species. Finally, we present a graphical model that links contemporary selection and macroevolution.

Ongoing debates agree on the pivotal role of a symbiosis between an alpha-proteobacterium and an Asgard archaeon.

To address these questions, we employed advanced phylogenomic approaches and comprehensive datasets spanning the known diversity of cellular life and viruses. Our analysis provided an updated reconstruction of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) proteome, in which we traced the phylogenetic origin of each protein family. We found compelling evidence for multiple waves of horizontal gene transfer from diverse bacterial and viral donors, with some likely preceding the mitochondrial endosymbiosis. We inferred the proteomes of the potential major donors and their functional contributions to LECA. Our findings underscore the contribution of horizontal gene transfers in shaping the proteomes of pre-LECA ancestors and hint to a facilitating role of Nucleocytoviricota viruses. Altogether, our results suggest ancient eukaryotes originated within complex microbial ecosystems through a succession of symbiotic interactions that left a footprint of horizontally transferred genes."]},

Our phylogenomic analyses reveal multiple independent colonization of insect vectors by the fungi, spanning from the mid-Cretaceous (114.6 Ma) to the early Quaternary (1.9 Ma). Contrary to expectations for obligate symbionts, ambrosia fungi showed no significant genome-wide reductions in size, gene count, or secreted protein repertoire compared to their non-symbiotic relatives. Instead, we observed complex, lineage-specific patterns of genomic adaptation. Key findings include lineage-specific expansions in carbohydrate-active enzyme families (AA4 in Nectriaceae, CE4 in Ophiostomataceae, and GH3 in Ophiostomataceae and Ceratocystidaceae), suggesting potential enhancement or loss of lignin modification, hemicellulose deacetylation, and cellulose degradation in different ambrosia lineages. Repeat-Induced Point mutation analysis revealed family-specific patterns rather than lifestyle-associated differences. These results highlight the diverse genomic strategies employed by ambrosia fungi, demonstrating that symbiont evolution can proceed through refined, lineage-specific changes rather than genome-wide, or convergent alterations.

Here, the results from more than 23 laboratories are presented. The primary purpose was to design experiments simulating typical casework circumstances; collect data and to implement Bayesian networks to assess the value (i.e., likelihood ratio) of DNA results given activity level propositions. Two different experimental designs were used to simulate a robbery, where a screwdriver was used to force a door or window. Propositions and case information were chosen following laboratory feedback listing typical casework circumstances (included in the paper). Whereas the proposition representing prosecution’s view is applicable to many cases: the defendant forced the door/window with his screwdriver; the proposition representing defence’s view are more variable depending on what is alleged to have happened. In a direct transfer experiment, the defendant owned and used the screwdriver, but he did not force the door/window in question. An unknown person used the defendant’s stolen screwdriver. In an indirect transfer experiment, the defendant neither owned, saw, nor used the screwdriver, nor did they force the door or window. Instead, an unknown individual—someone with whom the defendant had interacted (e.g., by shaking hands or touching the same objects)—used the recovered tool to force entry. In the first experiment, if the defendant forced the door/window, then s/he is the last handler of the screw driver, whereas if the tool was stolen and used by an unknown person, the defendant is the first handler. For the second experiment, given the defence view, the defendant never held the screwdriver. We envisaged the situation where an object manipulated by the defendant (or the defendant himself/herself) would be touched by the unknown offender who would then force the window. The time delay between the touching of the object and the forcing of the window was 0, 1h, and 2h. This was accomplished by handshaking experiments, where the person forcing the door would shake a person’s hand, and then use the screwdriver either immediately after handshake or after 1, 2 hours. It was found for the direct transfer experiment that unless a single contributor profile aligning with the known person’s of interest profile was retrieved, the results did not allow to discriminate propositions. On the other hand, for the indirect transfer experiment, both single and major contributor profiles that aligned with the person of interest (POI) supported the proposition that the person used the tool rather than an unknown person who had touched an object, when indeed the former was true. There was considerable variation in median recoveries of DNA between laboratories (between 200pg - 5ng) for a given experiment if quantities are taken into account. These differences affect the likelihood ratios given activity level propositions. More than 2,700 samples were analysed in the course of this study.

The theory of storage effect predicted that balanced polymorphism emerges if a population is subdivided into two parts that are respectively exposed to and protected from the selective effect of fluctuating environment. Recently, adding cyclic fluctuation in population size to the model of storage effect was found to generate a novel force of positive selection on fitness-amplifying mutants that are eventually maintained in oscillatory polymorphism or fixed in the population. The latter particularly has an effect of amplifying population size oscillation. To further understand these eco-evolutionary dynamics and elucidate their generality in natural populations, this study built more realistic models that assume randomly, not cyclically, fluctuating selection and common demographic features, including heterogeneous ecological patches or an age structure with overlapping generations. Mathematical analysis revealed that this novel evolutionary force is generated when the size of the subpopulation subject to weak selection does not covary with the rest of the population. Simulations showed that this ‘noncovarying storage effect’ is robust to various perturbations in the model. Multi-locus simulations revealed that oscillatory polymorphism at many loci can be simultaneously maintained and that positive feedback between demography and selection can accelerate the sequential fixations of fluctuation-amplifying mutations and thus lead to a drastic amplification of population size fluctuation. These results suggest that the noncovarying storage effect is a potentially prevalent evolutionary force in nature for maintaining genetic variation and causing large demographic fluctuations."]},

Concurrent with this species sorting process, genotypes within resistant taxa that have the highest relative fitness under severe stress are expected to increase in frequency, leading to evolutionary adaptation. However, empirical demonstrations of these dual ecological and evolutionary processes in natural communities are lacking. Here, we provide the first evidence for simultaneous species sorting and evolutionary adaptation across multiple species within a natural freshwater bacterial community. Using a two-phase stressor experimental design (acidification pre-exposure followed by severe acidification) in aquatic mesocosms, we show that pre-exposed communities were more resistant than naïve communities to taxonomic loss when faced with severe acid stress. However, after sustained severe acidification, taxonomic richness of both pre-exposed and naïve communities eventually converged. All communities experiencing severe acidification became dominated by an acidophilic bacterium, ", ", but this species retained greater genetic diversity and followed distinct evolutionary trajectories in pre-exposed relative to naïve communities.

Yet, evolutionary comparisons have revealed highly regular patterns of interchangeability between pairs of amino acids, and such patterns have proved enormously useful in a range of applications in bioinformatics, evolutionary inference, and protein design. Here we reconcile these apparently contradictory observations using fitness data from over 350,000 experimental amino acid replacements. Almost one-quarter of the 380 types of replacements have broad distributions of fitness effects (DFEs) that closely resemble the background DFE for random changes, indicating an overwhelming influence of protein context in determining mutational effects. However, we also observe that the 380 pair-specific DFEs closely follow a maximum entropy distribution, specifically a truncated exponential distribution. The shape of this distribution is determined entirely by its mean, which is equivalent to the chance that a replacement of the given type is fitter than a random replacement. In this type of distribution, modest deviations in the mean correspond to much larger changes in the probability of falling in the far right tail, so that modest differences in mean exchangeability may result in much larger differences in the chance of a highly fit mutation. Indeed, we show that under the assumption that purifying selection filters out the vast majority of mutations, the maximum entropy distributions of fitness effects inferred from deep mutational scanning experiments predict the characteristic patterns of amino acid change observed in molecular evolution. These maximum entropy distributions of mutational effects not only provide a tuneable model for molecular evolution, but also have implications for mutational effect prediction and protein engineering."]},

To test this, we combined cancer genomic analysis with extensive molecular dynamics simulations of mTOR oncogenic variants. We observed that conformational changes within mTOR kinase domain are associated with multiple mutational activation events. The mutations disturb the α-packing formed by the kαAL, kα3, kα9, kα9b, and kα10 helices in the kinase domain creating cryptic pocket. Its opening correlates with opening of the catalytic cleft, including active site residues realignment, favoring catalysis. The cryptic pocket created by disrupted α-packing coincides with the allosteric pocket in PI3Kα can be harmoniously fitted by the PI3Kα allosteric inhibitor RLY-2608, suggesting that analogous drugs designed based on RLY-2608 can restore the packed α-structure, resulting in mTOR inactive conformation.

Although highly efficient, radiation cause severe damages to normal tissue and radio-induced toxicities vary from mild pneumonitis to pulmonary fibrosis. The mechanism leading to these toxicities remain unclear. To investigate the molecular responses of human lung to radiotherapy, we analyzed, by single cell RNAseq, lung tissue resected in the vicinity of the tumor (i.e. treated with radiation) and compared the transcriptional profiles of the distinct lung populations from the same patient removed at distance from the tumor (i.e. non-treated with radiation). Analysis of six lung samples from patients suffering from Pancoast tumor, a rare lung malignancy that requires neo-adjuvant radiotherapy before surgery, revealed a strong induction of VEGF signaling after radiotherapy. Expression of VEGFA, one of the canonical pro-angiogenic ligands, was found upregulated in multiple cell populations in lung exposed to high doses of radiation. Irradiated capillaries, particularly gCap cells, expressing KDR/VEGFR2, present transcriptional profile similar to tip cells, characterized by sprouting and motility capacities. In addition, we identified a sub-population of alveolar macrophages expressing FLT1/VEGFR1, a receptor for VEGFA, in lung tissues treated by radiotherapy. Cell-Cell communication analysis revealed that FLT1/VEGFR1 positive macrophages interact with tip cells after radiotherapy through IL1B-IL1R signaling. Lastly, analysis of mouse single cell dataset confirmed the increase in the proportion of gCap cells presenting a tip-like phenotype after radiation injury. Altogether, this study describes, at the single cell level, the pro-angiogenic responses of human lung after radiotherapy. These results will lead to a better understanding of the physiopathology of lung radiation injury and may pave the way to optimize treatments to improve patients quality of life."]},

Viral mimicry has been previously described to augment anti-tumor immune responses and sensitize solid tumors to immunotherapy including colorectal cancer, melanoma, and clear renal cell carcinoma. Here, we found that targeting a novel, master epigenetic regulator, Zinc Finger Protein 638 (ZNF638), induces viral mimicry in glioblastoma (GBM) preclinical models and potentiates immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). ZNF638 recruits the HUSH complex, which precipitates repressive H3K9me3 marks on endogenous REs. In GBM, ZNF638 is associated with marked locoregional immunosuppressive transcriptional signatures, reduced endogenous RE expression and poor immune cell infiltration (CD8+ T-cells, dendritic cells). ZNF638 knockdown decreased H3K9-trimethylation, increased cytosolic dsRNA and activated intracellular dsRNA-signaling cascades (RIG-I, MDA5 and IRF3). Furthermore, ZNF638 knockdown upregulated antiviral immune programs and significantly increased PD-L1 immune checkpoint expression in patient-derived GBM neurospheres and diverse murine models. Importantly, targeting ZNF638 sensitized mice to ICI in syngeneic murine orthotopic models through innate interferon signaling. This response was recapitulated in recurrent GBM (rGBM) samples with radiographic responses to checkpoint inhibition with widely increased expression of dsRNA, PD-L1 and perivascular CD8 cell infiltration, suggesting dsRNA-signaling may mediate response to immunotherapy. Finally, we showed that low ZNF638 expression was a biomarker of clinical response to ICI and improved survival in rGBM patients and melanoma patients. Our findings suggest that ZNF638 could serve as a target to potentiate immunotherapy in gliomas."]},

Concerns have been mounting about the enhancement of arsenic toxicity through co-exposure to various prevalent lifestyle habits. Smokeless tobacco products are commonly consumed in South Asian countries, where their use frequently co-occurs with exposure to arsenic from contaminated groundwater. To decipher the in vitro molecular and cellular responses to arsenic and/or smokeless tobacco, we performed temporal multi-omics analysis of the transcriptome and DNA methylome remodelling in exposed hTERT-immortalized human normal oral keratinocytes (NOK), as well as arsenic and/or smokeless tobacco genotoxicity and mutagenicity investigations in NOK cells and in human p53 knock-in murine embryonic fibroblasts (Hupki MEF). RNAseq results from acute exposures to arsenic alone and in combination with smokeless tobacco extract revealed upregulation of genes with roles in cell cycle changes, apoptosis and inflammation responses. This was in keeping with global DNA hypomethylation affecting genes involved in the same processes in response to chronic treatment in NOK cells. At the phenotypic level, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in NOK cell viability, induction of DNA damage, cell cycle changes and increased apoptosis, with the most pronounced effects observed under arsenic and SLT co-exposure conditions. Live-cell imaging experiments indicated that the DNA damage likely resulted from induction of apoptosis, an observation validated by a lack of exome-wide mutagenesis in response to chronic exposure to arsenic and/or smokeless tobacco. In sum, our integrative omics study provides novel insights into the acute and chronic responses to arsenic and smokeless tobacco (co-)exposure, with both types of responses converging on several key mechanisms associated with cancer hallmark processes. The generated rich catalogue of molecular programs in oral cells regulated by arsenic and smokeless tobacco (co-)exposure may provide bases for future development of biomarkers for use in molecular epidemiology studies of exposed populations at risk of developing oral cancer."]},

While there are inherent costs to reproduction, behavioral interactions among individuals are often the primary drivers of reproductive costs. Males frequently compete for territories and females; females may compete for food or males; males often harass females. Here, we sought to determine whether reproductive costs were primarily due to male/male competition, female/female competition, or male/female interactions in the bluefin killifish. In this species, males guard small spawning territories where females visit them daily to spawn. To manipulate the potential for male and female competition and male/female interactions, we altered the sex ratio and density of each sex across four treatments (1 male: 1 female, 1 male : 3 females, 3 males: 1 female, 3 males: 3 females). Female mortality was higher than male mortality. Surprisingly, female mortality and male aggressive behaviors towards females (i.e., chases) were highest in treatments with a single male. Male-male aggression was present, but males often resolved these disputes via signaling by flaring their fins. There was little evidence for overt aggression among females. When males lack rivals, they turn their territorial defense towards females. These costs help explain why, in nature, females promptly leave male territories following spawning and join loose shoals with conspecific females and minnows."]},

Quantification of contact patterns is crucial to parametrize dynamic transmission models and to provide insights on the (basic) reproduction number. Information on social interactions, can (for instance) be obtained from population-based contact surveys, such as the European Commission project POLYMOD. Estimation of age-specific contact rates from these studies is often done using a piecewise constant approach or bivariate smoothing techniques. For the latter, typically, smoothing is done in the dimensions of the respondent’s and contact’s age. We propose a new flexible strategy based on a smoothing constrained approach - taking into account the reciprocal nature of contacts - where the contact rates are assumed smooth from a cohort perspective as well as from the age distribution of contacts. This is achieved by smoothing over the diagonal components (including all subdiagonals) of the social contact matrix. This approach is supported by the fact that people age with time and thus motivates smoothly varying contact rates from a cohort angle. Two approaches that allow for smoothing of social contact data over cohorts are proposed namely, (1) reordering of the diagonal components of the social contact matrix; and (2) reordering of the penalty matrix associated with the diagonal components. Parameter estimation is done in the likelihood framework by using constrained penalized iterative reweighted least squares (C-PIRLS), under Poisson and negative Binomial distributional assumptions for the observed contacts. A simulation study underlines the benefits of cohort-based smoothing based on two scalar measures of performance. Finally, the proposed methods are illustrated on the Belgian POLYMOD data of 2006.

Understanding how different turbidity sources impact the appearance of the ambient light environment is the foundational first step towards predicting whether and how animals will cope with the global increases in the severity and frequency of high turbidity events caused by anthropogenic disturbance. Here, we measured how four common turbidity sources (algae, bentonite, calcium carbonate, and kaolin), and variable turbidity levels, changed the appearance of the ambient light environment. We measured total number of photons (luminance), hue, chroma, and image contrast, and we evaluated the effect of each turbidity source and level on settling rate, pH, and KH. Both turbidity source and turbidity level impacted the appearance of the ambient light environment. With increasing turbidity level, calcium carbonate and kaolin increased luminance while algae decreased luminance, bentonite caused the greatest change in hue, and algae caused the greatest change in chroma. This demonstrates that the impacts of different turbidity sources on the ambient light environment are not uniform, giving a potential explanation for the discrepancies between studies on the effects of turbidity on fish behaviour. Consideration of the effect of specific turbidity sources on ambient light is crucial for the design of experiments that seek to investigate how changes in turbidity impact the perception of important visual information, which underpins the survival and reproductive success of aquatic organisms around the world."]},

Cage-free regulations often specify requirements for floor space and cage height, but the availability of three-dimensional space can vary depending on system configurations. Little research has looked at how much vertical space a hen occupies while flapping her wings, which is arguably her most space-intensive behavior. Therefore, the objective of this study was to use a depth sensing camera to measure the maximum vertical height hens reach when wing flapping without physical obstructions. Twenty-eight individually caged Hy-line W36 hens at 45 weeks of age were evaluated. A ceiling-mounted depth camera was centered above a test pen and calibrated prior to collecting data. During testing, one hen at a time was placed in the test pen and recorded flapping her wings. From depth footage, the minimum distance between pixels was obtained for each frame, and we computed the maximum vertical height reached by each hen. Results for vertical space used during a wing flapping event showed that hens reached a maximum height of 51.0 ± 4.7 cm. No physical measures correlated with maximum height obtained from the depth camera (P > 0.05). Hens in this study were from a single strain, were old enough to have keel damage, and were cage-reared and housed, preventing us from generalizing the results too far.

Therefore, to understand how variable histories of drug reinforcement might affect goal-directed and habitual pursuit of drug rewards, we trained rats to perform a multi-step decision-making task to earn oral fentanyl or sucrose rewards following extensive training with either fentanyl or sucrose. Importantly, this task allowed for independent measurements of goal-directed and habitual choice characteristics during online pursuit of rewards, and habitual choice could further be categorized into perseverative and reward-guided components. Extensive fentanyl training led to a bias for reward-guided habitual choice specifically in females, and a relatively high degree of perseveration in both sexes. These behavioral changes after chronic fentanyl generalized across fentanyl and sucrose seeking. In contrast, during fentanyl sessions, females showed increased perseveration, and both sexes showed blunting of the gradual improvement in goal-directed choice. These results show that chronic drug reinforcement induced habits that generalized across seeking drug and non-drug rewards, and female rats were especially susceptible to habitual control induced by both chronic and acute drug reinforcement."]},

We show that when competition between these systems is resolved by a winner-take-all mechanism, the precise condition for the emergence of habits can be cast in terms of the well-known probability matching principle. The theory embodies a trade-off in which exploitation, or overmatching, maximizes reward but strengthens habits, while paradoxically, exploration preserves goal-directed behavior by sacrificing rewards. This tradeoff can be averted if learning operates on abstract latent state representations whereby knowing the broader context allows for switching between two habits instead of avoiding one, thus maximizing rewards without forfeiting flexibility. The theory explains a range of animal behaviors as well as task-dependent effects of striatal manipulation, and suggests that neural mechanisms governing exploration implicitly control arbitration between decision-making systems."]},

It alerts us to changes in our environment working as an early warning system. However, when stress is prolonged, it can become harmful. The deleterious effects of stress on brain function are well established: chronic stress significantly impairs cognitive function reducing our ability to solve problems and to regulate behavior and, therefore, may lead to more challenges that can further exacerbate stress. An important class of decisions that may be made under stress includes those between rewards delivered immediately vs. those delivered in the future. Not considering or devaluing future outcomes (delay discounting) can result in adverse outcomes such as not buying health insurance, gambling or drug use. To date, however, little is known about how chronic stress influences economic decisions that differ in the time of outcome delivery. A handful of studies suggest that increased stress may lead to more impulsive choices in subjects of average socioeconomic status and stress levels. Here, we addressed this gap by using a longitudinal design to determine whether chronic stress measures (via questionnaires, saliva and hair samples) are associated with the economic choices under different time scales within subject (N = 34). We found that the degree to which people think it is worth waiting, i.e. individual’s discount factor, over seconds, but not over days, varied reliably with endogenous stress. These results are imperative to studying stress in a variety of contexts: e.g., the variation in consumer’s impulse purchases could be attributed to the variation in individual stress responses to the environment, even in healthy adults."]},

Recent data support the role of the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) and its projections to the dorsal hippocampal CA1 area (RE→dCA1) in this process. However, it remains poorly understood how RE impacts dCA1 neurons during contextual fear extinction (CFE). Here, we reveal that the RE→dCA1 pathway contributes to extinction of contextual fear by affecting CFE-induced molecular remodeling of excitatory synapses. Anatomical tracing and chemogenetic manipulation in mice demonstrate that RE neurons form synapses and regulate synaptic transmission in the stratum oriens (SO) and lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) of the dCA1 area, but not in the stratum radiatum (SR). We also observe CFE-specific structural changes of excitatory synapses and expression of the synaptic scaffold protein, PSD-95, in both strata innervated by RE, but not in SR. Interestingly, only the changes in SLM are specific for the dendrites innervated by RE. To further support the role of the RE→dCA1 projection in CFE, we demonstrate that brief chemogenetic inhibition of the RE→dCA1 pathway during a CFE session persistently impairs the formation of CFE memory and CFE-induced changes of PSD-95 levels in SLM. Thus, our data indicate that RE participates in CFE by regulating CFE-induced molecular remodeling of dCA1 synapses."]},

We present a method, ctyper, that leverages pangenomes to produce copy-number maps with allele-specific sequences containing locally phased variants of CNV genes from NGS reads. We extensively characterized accuracy and efficiency on a database of 3,351 CNV genes including HLA, SMN, and CYP2D6 as well as 212 non-CNV medically-relevant challenging genes. The genotypes capture 96.5% of underlying variants in new genomes, requiring 0.9 seconds per gene. Expression analysis of ctyper genotypes explains more variance than known eQTL variants. Comparing allele-specific expression quantified divergent expression on 7.94% of paralogs and tissue-specific biases on 4.7% of paralogs. We found reduced expression of SMN-1 converted from SMN-2, which potentially affects diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy, and increased expression of a duplicative translocation of AMY2B. Overall, ctyper enables biobank-scale genotyping of CNV and challenging genes."]},

Next, we used the accessibility of ACRs as a quantitative feature and performed a chromatin associability GWAS (caGWAS), resulting in 27,004 caQTLs. Among them, 2,463 were predicted to disrupt the cis-regulatory elements that TF binds in these ACRs, suggesting that TF binding affects chromatin accessibility.

However, Xists ability to diffuse under select circumstances has also been documented, leading us to suspect that Xist RNA may have targets and functions beyond the Xi. Here, using female mouse embryonic stem cells (ES) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) as models, we demonstrate that Xist RNA indeed can localize beyond the Xi. However, its binding is limited to approximately 100 genes in cells undergoing XCI (ES cells) and in post-XCI cells (MEFs). The target genes are diverse in function but are unified by their active chromatin status. Xist binds discretely to promoters of target genes in neighborhoods relatively depleted for Polycomb marks, contrasting with the broad, Polycomb-enriched domains reported for human XIST RNA. We find that Xist binding is associated with down-modulation of autosomal gene expression. However, unlike on the Xi, Xist binding does not lead to full silencing and also does not spread beyond the target gene. Over-expressing Xist in transgenic ES cells similarly leads to autosomal gene suppression, while deleting Xists Repeat B motif reduces autosomal binding and perturbs autosomal down-regulation. Furthermore, treating female ES cells with the Xist inhibitor, X1, leads to loss of autosomal suppression. Altogether, our findings reveal that Xist targets ~100 genes beyond the Xi, identify Repeat B as a crucial domain for its in-trans function in mice, and indicate that autosomal targeting can be disrupted by a small molecule inhibitor."]},

Yet, individuality is rarely studied in the context of behaviors that depend on learning. While it is established that such behaviors can vary across individuals, it remains unknown whether their variation stems from learning or from classical sources of individuality, the developmental stochasticity, environment and genetics (2-12). To answer this fundamental question, we measured behavior in thousands of flies in the presence and absence of learning, and compared the extent of their individuality. We discover an excess of non-normally distributed individual behavior only in flies that experienced learning, even though they were genetically identical, raised under the same conditions and exposed to the same environment as the non-learning flies. By tracking each fly's decision-making process, we find that learning does not simply change individual behavior, but it also diversifies it. We could recreate the emergence of this excess of individuality using computer simulations of behaving flies only when we enabled reinforced learning. Although individual experience and genetics shaped behavioral biases, we demonstrated that behavior can diverge due to learning even in individuals that share biases. Our results thus establish learning as the fundamental source of individuality, rather than a phenotypic outcome of genetics, environment, or development."]},

Yet, these disciplinary literacy skills and professional practices are often part of the hidden curriculum of science research, thus excluding students and others from fully understanding ways in which scientific knowledge is constructed, refined, and disseminated even though students are participating in such activities. Secondary students are increasingly involved in scientific research projects that include authentic disciplinary literacy components such as research proposals, posters, videos, and scientific research papers. More and more, students are also engaging in professional practice of publishing their scientific research papers through dedicated secondary science journals. How teachers and other mentors support the development of professional disciplinary literacies in students is critical to understand as part of supporting more student participation in research. To this end, we used a mixed- methods study of interviews and surveys to examine the experience and conceptions of the mentors (teachers and professional scientists) who guided pre-college students through the writing and publication of their scientific research projects. Analyzing our data from a lens of cognitive apprenticeship, we find that mentors encourage independence by primarily employing the method of “exploration”. We also find that mentors have divergent views on the value of publication within science, versus for student scientists specifically. Our findings suggest that mentors could work to explicitly reveal their own thinking within science writing to provide more sequenced support for student scientists."]},

Despite this, the literature reveals a gap in generalising these effects to specific classroom activities, partly arising from the absence of suitable instruments to measure emotions in situational educational scenarios. Our study introduces an experience sampling method to measure sixteen discrete emotional states, deriving two scales for positive and negative activating emotions. Grounded in psychological and neuroscientific theories that integrate emotion with cognition, our research explores the interplay between prior knowledge, preservice teachers’ anticipatory situational emotions, and subsequent learning in an experimental science education context. Analysing data from 269 preservice teachers from diverse backgrounds (STEM and non-STEM) at the upper-secondary level, we found that negative activating emotions are often rooted in non-STEM backgrounds and exacerbated by limited prior science knowledge. These negative emotions impact achievement and learning primarily through the mediating role of boredom. Furthermore, our results indicate that the detrimental impact of boredom on achievement is significantly influenced by prior knowledge, with a more pronounced effect on students with lower levels. Given that emotions are amenable to intervention, our findings propose that specifically addressing boredom in students with low prior knowledge could amplify the benefits of educational strategies."]},

Increased diversity benefits research directly as diverse teams have been shown to have better ideas and outcomes. In 2020, our department had lower gender diversity than would be expected based on the pool of PhD students and post-doctoral fellows in Canada. Therefore, we altered our hiring process, primarily by redacting applications, for recruitment into entry-level tenure-track faculty positions. With this change in process, female hires increased from 17% in the previous ten years (5 hires) to 80% in the subsequent four years (5 hires) with no substantial change in hiring of racially diverse individuals (50% to 40%). Overall, combined with retirements, the percentage of female faculty in the department went from 25% to 50% and the percentage of racialized faculty went from 38% to 44%. The new hires have met or exceeded expectations of success with respect to grant funding and are on track to meet or exceed expectations for other metrics of success. Thus, our intervention was very successful in increasing the diversity of our department within a short timeframe.

Recreating these intricate behaviors using well-defined molecules remains a major challenge at the intersection of biology, physics, and molecular engineering. Although the polymerization force of the actin cytoskeleton is characterized as a primary driver of cell motility, recapitulating this process in protocellular systems has proven elusive. The difficulty lies in the daunting task of distilling key components from motile cells and integrating them into model membranes in a physiologically relevant manner. To address this, we developed a method to optically control actin polymerization with high spatiotemporal precision within cell-mimetic lipid vesicles known as giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Within these active protocells, the reorganization of actin networks triggered outward membrane extensions as well as the unidirectional movement of GUVs at speeds of up to 0.43 μm/min, comparable to typical adherent mammalian cells. Notably, our findings reveal a synergistic interplay between branched and linear actin forms in promoting membrane protrusions, highlighting the cooperative nature of these cytoskeletal elements.

In this work, we design and validate a plasmid set – the pXpressome toolkit -in which α-carboxysomes are robustly expressed and remain intact and functional after purification. We tested this toolkit by introducing mutations which influence carboxysome structure and performance. We find that deletion of vertex-capping genes results in formation of larger carboxysomes while deletion of facet forming genes produces smaller particles, suggesting that adjusting the ratio of these proteins can rationally affect morphology. Through a series of fluorescently labeled constructs, we observe this toolkit leads to more uniform expression and better cell health than previously published carboxysome expression systems. Overall, the pXpressome toolkit facilitates the study and redesign of carboxysomes with robust performance and improved phenotype uniformity.

Despite its advantages, this system still struggles with soluble expression of recombinant proteins. To address this, various solubility-enhancing and yield-improving methods such as the addition of fusion tags have been developed. However, traditional tags such as small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) and Glutathione S-transferase (GST) can interfere with protein folding or require removal post-translation, which adds complexity and cost to production. To circumvent these issues, smaller solubility tags (<10 kDa) are preferred. This study specifically focuses on an 11-amino acid solubility-enhancing tag (NT11) derived from the N-terminal domain of a duplicated carbonic anhydrase from Dunaliella species. Results: A comprehensive analysis was performed to improve the characteristics of the 11-amino acid tag. By investigating the alanine-scan library of NT11, we increased its activity and identified key residues for further development. Screening with the alanine mutant library consistently led to at least a two-fold improvement in protein yield for three different proteins. We also discovered that the NT11 tag is not limited to the N-terminal position and can function at either the N- or C-terminal of the protein, providing flexibility in designing protein expression constructs. With these new insights, we have successfully doubled the recombinant protein yields of valuable growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and an originally low-yielding human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), in E. coli. Conclusion: The further characterisation and development of the NT11 tag have provided valuable insights into the optimization process for such small tags and expanded our understanding of its potential applications. The ability of NT11 tag to be positioned at different locations within the protein construct without compromising its effectiveness to enhance recombinant protein yields, makes it a valuable tool across a diverse range of proteins. Collectively, these findings have the potential to simplify and enhance the efficiency of recombinant protein production."]},

Genetic concepts can be depicted with lines, letters, shapes, and symbols, and students need to engage their visual literacy skills to appropriately decipher these abstract representations. We previously found that undergraduate course materials almost always represent chromosomes in abstract forms, such as “X” shapes or straight lines with a dot for the centromere. We hypothesized that students struggle to apply their visual literacy skills to accurately interpret these abstract representations of chromosomes, which may be related to the frequently-documented incomplete or incorrect ideas students have about chromosome structure and function. To explore students’ visual literacy related to representations of chromosomes, we conducted 35 semi-structured interviews with students who had taken at least a year of biology courses. We asked them to sketch chromosomes, interpret an abstract representation of chromosomes, and use the abstract representation to answer a question about meiosis. We found that 97% of participants (34 of 35) held conceptual errors related to chromosome structure and function. These conceptual errors were often not evident in participants’ verbal definitions of chromosomes and were only revealed in their sketches or explanations of their sketches. We found that participants frequently misinterpreted X-shaped representations of chromosomes, mistook unreplicated homologous chromosomes as separated sister chromatids, and held misconceptions related to the structure and function of centromeres. These findings have implications for how chromosomes are taught in biology courses. We recommend that instructors explicitly discuss the conventions and norms of representing chromosomes as a pathway for increasing students’ visual literacy in molecular biology."]},

The lack of membranes also means that sensor designs and reaction optimizations can be screened in high throughput. While shelf stability has been demonstrated in specific cases using additives, these approaches are not universal to the myriad cell-free expression methods and formats. Here, we present new high-throughput screening methods to optimize cell-free expression formulations when embedded into paper for use as sensors. Our method leverages acoustic liquid handling to dispense reactions onto 384-well paper ticket formats and machine vision to quantify reaction performance from a colorimetric reporter enzyme. The throughput enabled shifts the bottleneck from experimental execution to selecting the experiments to execute; we therefore implement design-of-experiments to optimize the information gained from each design-build-test-learn cycle. We used these approaches to first optimize the performance of a low-cost cell-free expression formulation that was initially non- functional when embedded in paper, then further optimize it for tolerance to exposure to heat. With only 2 rounds of experimentation lasting 4 days total for each goal, the result are an energy mixture with 8% of the materials cost of a commonly used version and a formulation of excipients that maintain 60% of activity after 6 hours of storage at 50 °C and. Finally, we showcase the use of the cost-optimized formulation in a 3D-printed paperfluidic device where it outperforms the standard formulation at much lower cost."]},

Our approach focuses on challenges in specifying scientific studies for scientific inference via statistical inference, and is complementary to classical discussions in philosophy of statistics. We particularly consider the challenges in replicating studies exactly, using the notion of the idealized experiment. We argue against treating reproducibility as an inherently desirable property of scientific results, and in favor of viewing it as a tool to measure distance between an original study and its replications. To sensibly study the implications of replicability and results reproducibility on inference, such a measure of replication distance is needed. We present an effort to delineate such a framework here, addressing some challenges in capturing the components of scientific studies while identifying others as ongoing issues. We illustrate our measure of replication distance by simulations using a toy example. Rather than replications, we present purposefully planned modifications as an appropriate tool to inform scientific inquiry. Our ability to measure replication distance serves scientists in their search for replication-ready studies. We believe that likelihood-based and evidential approaches may play a critical role towards building a statistics that effectively serves the practical needs of science."]},

Previous studies have identified phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming as early predictors. However, the graphic complexity of Arabic letters imposes particular constraints on the visual system, which should mobilize visual attention. To test this hypothesis, 101 Arabic-speaking children who just began their formal reading instruction in Arabic were administered tests of syllable and word reading. Their nonverbal reasoning, vocabulary, phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming and letter knowledge were measured. Their visual attention was estimated through tasks of visual attention span. We found that phonological awareness, visual attention span and letter knowledge were associated with reading outcomes. However, regression analyses showed that the relationship between visual attention span and reading disappeared when letter knowledge was taken-into-account. We used structural equation modeling to examine the direct and indirect effects of visual attention span to reading. Results showed that phonological awareness and letter knowledge were significant and independent predictors of reading while visual attention span contributed only indirectly through its influence on letter knowledge. Our findings suggest that beginning readers rely on visual attention to identify and discriminate visually-complex Arabic letters. In turn, more efficient letter identification in children with higher visual attention facilitates reading acquisition. These findings support the cognitive models of word recognition that include visual attention as a component of the reading system. They open new perspectives for cross-language studies, suggesting that visual attention might contribute differently to reading depending on the orthographic system. They also provide a foundation for innovative teaching methodologies in Arabic language education."]},

Herein, we present a novel strategy for assembling long L-RNAs via the joining of two or more shorter fragments using cross-chiral ligase ribozymes together with new substrate activation chemistry. We show that 5′-monophosphorylated L-RNA, which is readily prepared by solid phase synthesis, can be activated by chemical attachment of a 5′-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) or diphosphate (ADP), yielding 5′-adenosyl (di-or tri-) phosphate L-RNA. The activation reaction is performed in mild aqueous conditions, proceeds efficiently with short or large L-RNA, and, yielding few biproducts, requires little or no further purification after activation. Importantly, both groups, when added to L-RNA, are compatible with ribozyme-mediated ligation, with the 5′-adenosyl triphosphate permitting rapid and efficient joining of multiple, long L-RNA strands. This is exemplified by the assembly of a 129-nt L-RNA molecule via a single cross-chiral ligation event.

However, invading microbes rarely find novel territories uninhabited. In such a scenario, resident microbes can interact with the newcomers and, in many cases, impede their invasion, an effect known as biotic resistance. Accordingly, invasions are shaped by the interplay between dispersal and resistance. However, these two factors are difficult to disentangle or manipulate in natural systems, making their interplay difficult to understand. To address this challenge, we tracked microbial invasions in the lab over space and time, first in a model system of two interacting microbes, then in a multi-strain system involving a pathogen invading resident communities. In the presence of biotic resistance, we observed three qualitatively different invasion regimes: consistent, pulsed, and pinned, where, in the third regime, strong biotic resistance stalled the invasion entirely despite ongoing invader dispersal. Surprisingly, these rich invasion dynamics could be qualitatively predicted with a simple, parameter-free framework that ignores individual species interactions, even for rather complex communities. Moreover, we showed that this simple framework could accurately predict simulated invasions from different mechanistic models, indicating its broad applicability. Our work offers a thorough understanding of how biotic resistance impacts invasions and introduces a predictive tool to identify invasion-resistant communities."]},

In primary but not metastatic melanoma biopsies, the burden of coding mutations in desmosome genes associates with a strong reduction in desmosome gene expression. Analysis by spatial transcriptomics and protein immunofluorescence suggests that these expression decreases occur in keratinocytes in the microenvironment rather than in primary melanoma cells. In further support of a microenvironmental origin, we find that desmosome gene knockdown in keratinocytes yields markedly increased proliferation of adjacent melanoma cells in keratinocyte/melanoma co-cultures.

Based on continuous cultivation analyzed and control by automated flow cytometry, we quantified the trade-off between cellular growth and gene expression and tracked the cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression (measured as entropy). We concluded that the growth reduction associated to the activation of the burdensome gene circuit, i.e., the switching cost, is at the origin of the population heterogeneity. The loss of growth rate imposed by the burdensome activation of the gene is compensated at the population level by the overgrowth of less induced cells that safeguard the population by generating entropy. We tried to homogenize the population by pulsing the inducer with increasing frequency but found that the population escapes control through promoter mutation, leading to a genotype exhibiting reduced gene expression, but also, reduced entropy. To engineer a more homogeneous population without sacrificing gene expression, we decreased the switching cost associated to the induction by lowering the quality of the main carbon source. This strategy successfully led to a more homogeneous and productive population. Our approach allows for a precise quantification of the trade-off between growth and gene expression in cell population cultivated under dynamic conditions and highlights the importance of the switching cost for designing efficient approaches of cell population control."]},

In the present study, we observed a fast evolution of β-lactam resistance (20-fold) increase in MIC in 8 hours) in E. coli after deleting RecA and exposing the bacteria to a single dose of ampicillin.

Additionally, we identified the rapid emergence of drug resistance associated mutations in the resistant bacterial genome, indicating the impairment of DNA repair. Through comprehensive transcriptome sequencing, we discovered that the expression of numerous antioxidative response genes is repressed in recA mutant resistant isolates, resulting in an excessive accumulation of ROS within the cells.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can regulate the expression of transcription factors at the post-transcriptional level. The interactions between SOX10 and its targeting miRNAs form network motifs such as feedforward and feedback loops. Such motifs can result in non-linear dynamics in gene expression levels, therefore playing a crucial role in regulating tumor proliferation and metastasis as well as tumor’s responses to therapies. Here, we reviewed and discussed the intricate interplay between SOX10 and miRNAs in melanoma biology including melanogenesis, phenotype switch, and therapy resistance. Additionally, we investigated the gene regulatory interactions in melanoma, identifying crucial network motifs that involve both SOX10 and miRNAs. We also analyzed the expression levels of the components within these motifs. From a control theory perspective, we explained how these dynamics are linked to the phenotypic plasticity of melanoma cells. In summary, we underscored the importance of employing a data-driven network biology approach to elucidate the complex regulatory mechanisms and identify driver network motifs within the melanoma network. This methodology facilitates a deeper understanding of the regulation of SOX10 by miRNAs in melanoma. The insight gained could potentially contribute to the development of miRNA-based treatments for SOX10, thereby enhancing the clinical management of this malignancy."]},

By overexpressing or knocking down expression of c-di-AMP synthase genes, we made strains producing different levels of c-di-AMP, which we linked to changes in secondary differentiation status. Increases in c-di-AMP resulted in an earlier increase in transcription of EB-associated genes, and this was further manifested in earlier production of EBs. In contrast, when c-di-AMP levels were decreased, secondary differentiation was delayed. Based on these data, we conclude there is a threshold level of c-di-AMP needed to trigger secondary differentiation in Chlamydia.

It differentiates between two functional and morphological forms: elementary body (EB) and reticulate body (RB). The signals that trigger differentiation from one form to the other are unknown. EBs and RBs have distinctive characteristics that distinguish them, including their size, infectivity, proteome, and transcriptome. Intriguingly, they also differ in their overall redox status as EBs are oxidized and RBs are reduced. We hypothesize that alterations in redox may serve as a trigger for secondary differentiation. To test this, we examined the function of the primary antioxidant enzyme alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (AhpC), a well-known member of the peroxiredoxins family, in chlamydial growth and development. Based on our hypothesis, we predicted that altering the expression of ahpC would modulate chlamydial redox status and trigger earlier or delayed secondary differentiation. To test this, we created ahpC overexpression and knockdown strains. During ahpC knockdown, ROS levels were elevated, and the bacteria were sensitive to a broad set of peroxide stresses. Interestingly, we observed increased expression of EB-associated genes and concurrent higher production of EBs at an earlier time in the developmental cycle, indicating earlier secondary differentiation occurs under elevated oxidation conditions. In contrast, overexpression of AhpC created a resistant phenotype against oxidizing agents and delayed secondary differentiation. Together, these results indicate that redox potential is a critical factor in developmental cycle progression. For the first time, our study provides a mechanism of chlamydial secondary differentiation dependent on redox status."]},

In Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), considerable evidence shows that the dynamics between residual leukemia and the patient’s immune system can result in either sustained disease control, leading to treatment-free remission (TFR), or disease recurrence. The question remains how to integrate mechanistic and data-driven models to support prediction of treatment outcomes. Starting from classical ecological modeling concepts, which allow to explicitly account for immune interactions at the cellular level, we incorporate time-course data on natural killer (NK) cell number, function, and their tumor-induced suppression into a model of CML treatment. We identify relevant time scales governing treatment and immune response, enabling refined model calibration using tumor and NK cell time courses from different datasets. While the model successfully describes patient-specific response dynamics, critical parameters for predicting treatment outcome remain uncertain. However, by explicitly incorporating tumor load changes in response to TKI dose alterations, these parameters can be estimated and used to derive model predictions for treatment cessation. Further exploring dynamic changes in the number of functional immune cells, we suggest specific measurement strategies of immune effector cell populations to enhance prediction accuracy for CML recurrence following treatment cessation. The generalizability and flexibility of our approach represent a significant step towards quantitative, personalized medicine that integrates tumor-immune dynamics to guide clinical decisions and optimize dynamic cancer therapies."]},

Near-infrared spectroscopical technologies have proved to be promising for application in the integrative taxonomy of insects, and it is a true-non-destructive method, causing no damage to the sample and being completely chemical-preparation-free. Near-infrared spectral profiles are known as the fingerprints of the chemical composition of a given sample, and a new layer of information may be accessed. Hyperspectral imaging technologies in the near-infrared range are among the most popular, although their usage is still incipient in insect studies. As in other animal taxa, katydids' taxonomy has traditionally been based on morphological comparison, resulting in many misclassifications over the years. However, integrative methods are more and more required in taxonomic studies. Different methods and technologies have been used from an integrative perspective to minimize misidentifications, especially for non-taxonomist or untrained researchers. Here, we approach the applicability of near-infrared spectroscopy coupled with hyperspectral imaging technology to Ensifera specimens housed in collections, discussing the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges to future applications. As a result, we propose using only homologous body parts in comparing and modeling species using this kind of data due to the heterogeneity of the insects' exoskeleton. Additionally, we made a case study by discriminating four species of the katydid genus Conocephalus Thunberg, one of the most speciose genera within Orthoptera that is known to have polymorphic species, with variations expressed in the wing development and postabdomen appendages. We generated a Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) classification model for the species with an overall classification accuracy for the assigned pixels of 90% and specific accuracy for pixel discrimination ranging from 96% to 98%. This is one of the few research studies employing hyperspectral imaging in insects' taxonomy, and it is the very first to use this technology in Orthoptera; therefore, this is a preliminary approach to usage as an integrative method."]},

Despite epidermal microstructures on the fins of other benthic fishes, little exploration of pectoral fin surfaces at the microscopic scale has been undertaken in sculpins. Using scanning electron microscopy, we discovered microscopic, fibrillar projections contained within single cells on the ventral surfaces of the paired fin rays of two intertidal and two subtidal species of marine sculpins. In contrast to subtidal species, the intertidal species possessed epidermal cells with discrete channels separating groups of fibrillar projections.

In this work, we compare and contrast intranasal (i.n.) and intramuscular (i.m.) administration of a SARS-CoV-2 self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine delivered by a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC). Both i.m. and i.n. vaccines induce potent systemic serum neutralizing antibodies, bone marrow-resident IgG-secreting cells, and splenic T cell responses. The i.n. vaccine additionally induces robust respiratory mucosal immune responses, including SARS-CoV-2-reactive lung-resident memory and lung-homing T cell populations. As a booster following previous i.m. vaccination, the i.n. vaccine also elicits the development of mucosal virus-specific T cells. Both the i.m. and i.n. administered vaccines durably protect hamsters from infection-associated morbidity upon viral challenge, significantly reducing viral loads and preventing challenged hamsters from transmitting virus to naive cagemates. This saRNA-NLC vaccine's potent systemic immunogenicity, and additional mucosal immunogenicity when delivered i.n., may be key for combating SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens."]},

The relevance of these pathways to the development of inflammatory disorders in humans remains unknown.  We hypothesized that a comprehensive examination of the ANS-immune network in patients with HIV, would reveal that the type and severity of autonomic neuropathy (AN) would predict immune phenotypes with distinct clinical and demographic characteristics.    \nMethods: This is a cross-sectional study of 79 adult people with a history of well-controlled HIV on stable combination antiretroviral treatment (CART) recruited from a primary care clinic network within the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. All participants underwent a standardized battery of autonomic function tests summarized as the Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS) and vagal and adrenergic baroreflex sensitivity (BRS-V and BRS-A). Immune profiling included: 1) measurement of interleukin-6 (IL-6) as part of the Olink assay Target 96 Inflammation Panel, 2) non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering analyses on Olink immune biomarkers, and 3) mass cytometry (CyTOF) on a subset of participants with and without autonomic neuropathy (N = 10).  \nResults: Reduced activity of caudal vagal circuitry involved in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) predicted higher levels of IL-6 (Spearman's rho = -0.352, p=0.002). The comprehensive assessment of the ANS-immune network showed four immunotypes defined by NMF analyses. A pro-inflammatory immunotype defined by elevations in type 1 cytokines (IL-6, IL-17) and increased numbers of CD8+ T-cells was associated with autonomic neuropathy (AN). This association was driven by deficits in the cardiovascular sympathetic nervous system and remained strongly significant after controlling for the older age and greater burden of co-morbid illness among participants with this immunotype (aOR=4.7, p=0.017).  \nDiscussion:  Our results provide novel support for the clinical relevance of the CAP in patients with chronic inflammatory AN. These data also provide insight regarding the role of the sympathetic nervous system and aging in the progression and development of co-morbidities in patients with chronic HIV and support future research aimed at developing therapies focused on modulation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic/vagal nervous system."]},

However, it is unclear why some ACPA+ individuals convert to clinical RA while others do not. We explored the possibility in the Targeting Immune Responses for Prevention of Rheumatoid Arthritis (TIP-RA) study that epigenetic remodeling is part of the trajectory from an at-risk state to clinical disease and identifies novel biomarkers associated with conversion to clinical RA.\nMethods\nACPA- Controls, ACPA+ At-Risk, and Early RA individuals were followed for up to 5 years, including obtaining blood samples annually and at RA diagnosis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated into CD19+ B cells, memory CD4+ T cells, and naive CD4+ T cells using antibodies and magnetic beads. Genome-wide methylation within each cell lineage was assayed using the Illumina MethylationEPIC v1.0 beadchip. ACPA+ At-Risk participants who did or did not develop RA were designated Pre-RA or Non-converters, respectively. Differentially methylated loci (DML) were selected using the Limma software package. Using the Caret package, we constructed machine learning models in test and validation cohorts and identified the most predictive loci of clinical RA conversion.\nResults\nCross-sectional differential methylation analysis at baseline revealed DMLs that distinguish the Pre-RA methylome from ACPA+ Non-converters, the latter which closely resembled ACPA- Controls. Genes overlapping these DMLs correspond to aberrant NOTCH signaling and DNA repair pathways in B cells. Longitudinal analysis showed that ACPA- Control and ACPA+ Non-converter methylomes are relatively constant. In contrast, the Pre-RA methylome remodeled along a dynamic RA methylome trajectory characterized by epigenetic changes in active regulatory elements. Clinical conversion to RA, defined based on diagnosis, marked an epigenetic inflection point for cell cycle pathways in B cells and adaptive immunity pathways in naive T cells. Machine learning revealed individual loci associated with RA conversion. This model significantly outperformed autoantibodies plus acute phase reactants as predictors of RA conversion.\nConclusion\nDNA methylation is a dynamic process in ACPA+ individuals at-risk for developing RA that eventually transition to clinical disease. In contrast, non-converters and controls have stable methylomes. The accumulation of epigenetic marks over time prior to conversion to clinical RA conforms to pathways that are associated with immunity and can be used to identify potential pathogenic pathways for therapeutic targeting and/or use as prognostic biomarkers."]},

Comprehensive characterization of 632 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from those B cells reveals that mAbs cloned after reinfection have dramatically enhanced neutralizing breadth and potency, including 11 mAbs that potently neutralize all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants from WT to KP.3. Among the 11 mAbs, 5 mAbs are classified into public clonotypes encoded by IGHV3-53 or IGHV3-66, whereas the rest belong to a rarely reported clonotype encoded by IGHV3-74. Notably, IGHV3-74 mAbs can neutralize SARS-CoV-1 with a minimum IC50 of 0.055 μg/ml. Structural and functional analysis further suggests that IGHV3-74 mAbs target a novel epitope on receptor-binding domain and the best mAb, termed KXD352, is highly resilient to variations on this epitope. Overall, this study demonstrates that both public and rare antibody clonotypes primed by prototype mRNA vaccine can achieve extraordinary neutralizing breadth and potency in repeated Omicron infections."]},

Here, a multi-omics approach was applied to profile the immune response of 30 wP and 31 aP-primed individuals and identify correlates of T cell polarization before and after Tdap booster vaccination. We found that transcriptional changes indicating an interferon response on day 1 post-booster along with elevated plasma concentrations of IFN-γ and interferon-induced chemokines that peaked at day 1-3 post-booster correlated best with the Th1 polarization of the vaccine-induced memory T cell response on day 28.

We use conditional and restrictive expression tools to spatiotemporally manipulate core protein activity, combined with quantitative measurement of core protein distribution, polarity and stability. Our results provide evidence for a robust cell-scale signal, while arguing against mechanisms that depend on depletion of a limited pool of a core protein or polarised transport of core proteins on microtubules.

The micromere of the sea urchin embryo may serve as one of those examples: An ACD at the 16-cell stage forms micromeres unique to echinoids among echinoderms. We previously reported that a polarity factor, Activator of G-protein Signaling (AGS), plays a crucial role in micromere formation. However, AGS and its associated ACD factors are present in all echinoderms and across most metazoans, leaving a question of what evolutionary modification of AGS protein or its surrounding molecular environment contributed to the evolutionary acquisition of micromeres only in echinoids. In this study, we learned that the GoLoco motifs at the AGS C-terminus play critical roles in regulating micromere formation in sea urchin embryos. Further, other echinoderms AGS or chimeric AGS that contain the C-terminus of AGS orthologs from various organisms showed varied localization and function in micromere formation. In contrast, the sea star or the pencil urchin orthologs of other ACD factors were consistently localized at the vegetal cortex in the sea urchin embryo, suggesting that AGS may be a unique variable factor that facilitates ACD diversity among echinoderms. Consistently, sea urchin AGS appears to facilitate micromere-like cell formation and accelerate the enrichment timing of the germline factor Vasa during early embryogenesis of the pencil urchin, an ancestral type of sea urchin. Based on these observations, we propose that the molecular evolution of a single polarity factor facilitates ACD diversity while preserving the core ACD machinery among echinoderms and beyond during evolution."]},

Building on recent formalizations of this phenomenon, we tackle the computational challenge of exhaustively detecting autocatalytic cycles in reactions networks, and further evaluate the impact of thermodynamic constraints on their realization under mass action kinetics. We first characterize the complexity of the detection problem by proving its NP-completeness. This justifies the use of constraint solvers to list all autocatalytic cycles in a given reaction network, and also to group them into compatible sets, composed of cycles whose stoichiometric requirements are not contradictory. Crucially, we show that the introduction of thermodynamic realism does constrain the composition of these sets. Compatibility relationships among cycles can indeed be disrupted when the reaction kinetics obey thermodynamic consistency throughout the network. On the contrary, these constraints have no impact on the realizability of isolated cycles, unless upper or lower bounds are imposed on the concentrations of the reactants. Overall, by better characterizing the conditions of autocatalysis in complex reaction systems, this work brings us a step closer to assessing the contribution of this collective chemical behavior to the emergence of natural selection in the primordial soup."]},

Here, we focus on a diseased site (Freycinet Peninsula, Tasmania, Australia) with 18 years of continuous mark-recapture data to test: (1) whether rates of precocial breeding in females continued to increase after the initial rise after the emergence of the disease, (2) whether there was a relationship between body size and breeding success for either one-year-olds or adult females (i.e., at least two-years-old), and (3) whether there was inbreeding depression in breeding success for either age category. We show that rates of precocial breeding did not continue to rise, and that the proportion of precocially breeding females has plateaued at around 50%. We also show that there was no effect of body size on the probability of breeding for either one-year-old or for adult females. Finally, we show that there was no evidence for inbreeding depression in breeding success for either age class. We discuss possible constraints that may have inhibited further rise in rates of precocial breeding in the context of limitations to growth in the offspring of precocially breeding (and therefore smaller) females."]},

Through reporter assays, we identified NHR-23-binding sites that are necessary and sufficient for epithelial expression. We generated a translational fusion and demonstrated that MLT-11 is localized to the cuticle and lined openings to the exterior (vulva, rectum, mouth). We created a set of strains expressing varied levels of MLT-11 by deleting endogenous cis-regulatory element sequences. Combined deletion of two cis-regulatory elements caused developmental delay, motility defects, and failure of the cuticle barrier. Inactivation of mlt-11 by RNAi produced even more pronounced defects. mlt-11 is necessary to pattern every layer of the adult cuticle, suggesting a broad patterning role prior to the formation of the mature cuticle.

This niche controls hematopoietic progenitors of the lymph gland (LG). PSC cells were previously shown to be specified laterally in the embryo, but ultimately reside dorsally, at the LG posterior. Here, using live-imaging, we show that PSC cells migrate as a tight collective and associate with multiple tissues during their trajectory to the LG posterior. We find that Slit emanating from two extrinsic sources, visceral mesoderm and cardioblasts, is required for the PSC to remain a collective, and for its attachment to cardioblasts during migration. Without proper Slit-Robo signaling, PSC cells disperse, form aberrant contacts, and ultimately fail to reach their stereotypical position near progenitors.

Here, we report on a field trial aiming at the identification of ADB tolerant genotypes while encompassing the genetic diversity of common ash in Austria. Over 35,000 progenies from more than 600 putative tolerant mother trees were assessed for ADB symptoms over a period of three years. One tolerant and one susceptible progeny from a subset of the mother tree range (570 trees) were genotyped using the 4TREE array, a genotyping tool developed specifically to screen common ash provenances for their tolerance to ash dieback. We aimed to (1) better characterize the genetic structure of common ash in Austria, (2) identify hybrids between common ash and F. angustifolia (narrow-leaved ash), (3) detect genetic loci associated with tolerance to ADB, and (4) identify genetic variation associated with abiotic factors such as temperature and precipitation influencing the severity of ADB. We identify ash individuals from Eastern Austria matching putative hybrids with F. angustifolia showing varying degrees of F. angustifolia ancestry in structure analyses. The non-hybrid gene pool is characterized by shallow genetic structure following a west to east geographic pattern. In contrast to our expectations, genotype-damage association analyses overall fail to detect SNPs associated with tolerance to ADB. Our findings underscore that the polygenic architecture governing tolerance and the rapid decay of genomic linkage disequilibrium (LD) (within approximately 10 kb) significantly limit the ability to identify association outliers using the 4TREE SNP array. This highlights the constrained utility of chip genotyping approaches for this specific purpose. In contrast, the array proves successful in detecting hybrids between common ash and narrow-leaved ash, as well as outlier SNPs associated with abiotic predictors (such as annual precipitation and temperature) known to influence the severity of ADB damage."]},

The human orthologs of such genes are also potential targets for both contraception and treatment of infertility. One gene system of particular interest is the sperm-binding genes of the inner egg coat or zona pellucida (Zp2, Zp3) and their cognate protein in the mouse sperm acrosome (Zp3r). Previous population genetic analyses in humans pointed toward three balanced polymorphisms (one in each gene ZP2, ZP3, and ZP3R) as potential targets of some form of balancing selection in the evolution of human fertility. We tested that association using genetic analysis of couples seeking fertility assistance, but we could not reject the null hypothesis of no association between balanced polymorphisms and infertility. Our study was based on a small sample of couples, but the data were sound: the allele frequencies at those three balanced polymorphisms were not different from random expectation in that clinical sample. If an effect of those allele frequencies on infertility exists it is probably small. Our study was based in part on an old error in gene annotation that was only recently discovered (after the start of participant recruitment for this genetic analysis), and this error may account for our results, which argue against a role for balancing selection on those three genes in humans."]},

Recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) have linked variation in a large number of genes with increased risk of ARHL for the first time. Amongst the strongest of these associations is variation in KLHDC7B, a gene of unknown function and one not previously linked to hearing. \nMethods: To confirm whether KLHDC7B plays a role in hearing we investigated auditory function in two independent knockout mutant mouse models of Klhdc7b:  Klhdc7bIMPC-/- and Klhdc7bD/D; on the C57BL/6N background and the B6.CAST-Cdh23753A>G background respectively. The B6.CAST-Cdh23753A>G background was backcrossed to correct a known age-related hearing loss (ahl) mutation in cadherin 23 present in both the C57BL/6N and C57BL/6J strains. \nResults: We showed that Klhdc7b is expressed exclusively in inner and outer sensory hair cells within the cochlea of mice at the RNA and protein level. Homozygous mutants for both knockout mouse models display a similar early-onset, progressive and severe hearing loss. Histological characterization of the two mouse models suggests that hair cells develop normally and are present in neonates. However, after the onset of hearing there is a progressive loss of outer hair cells in a gradient from base to apex of the cochlea consistent with the hearing deficit in the mice and the pattern of hearing loss in ARHL. Inner hair cells remain intact up to the latest age examined (~8 weeks). \nConclusions: Our data suggests KLHDC7B is required for maintenance of auditory function rather than in its development, supporting the novel association with ARHL in humans detected in recent GWAS. To our knowledge, this is the first validation in mouse of an ARHL association in humans detected in a GWAS.  Our work also provides two distinct mouse models to further investigate the role of KLHDC7B in auditory function and for use in the development of therapeutic tools to prevent or treat ARHL."]},

In the melanic marginal band, Dsx is required in each sex to enforce the presence of lanceolate scales in males, and their absence in females. Single-nucleus RNAseq reveals that UV-iridescent and lanceolate scale cell precursors each show distinctive gene expression profiles at 40% of pupal development, with marker genes that include regulators of transcription, cell signaling, cytoskeletal patterning, and chitin secretion.

Cdkn1c expression progressively increases in neural progenitors, and its knock down leads to a reduction of neuron production, following a shortening of cell cycle mainly attributed to a reduction in G1 duration. Clonal analysis of pairs of sister cells indicates that reducing Cdkn1c expression in progenitors delays neurogenesis by favoring a symmetric proliferative mode of division. Combined CyclinD1 and Cdkn1c knockdowns restores the cell cycle defects and a wild-type distribution of modes of division, indicating that Cdkn1c acts via the regulation of cell cycle parameters.

However, for lesser-known infectious diseases, such as tick-borne viruses, disease risk reporting should account for more than just the biology of the disease and include mediating factors such as socioeconomics which can determine if an infection gets reported. Objectives: We aim to identify country-level ecological and socioeconomic factors important to reporting tick-borne viruses and examine whether countries with more economic resources have a higher likelihood of reporting resource intensive incidences. Our study goals are to determine potential country-level interventions that could enhance recognition of and reduce the health burden associated with tick-borne viruses. Methods: We apply machine learning to the most comprehensive tick-borne virus database, ZOVER, with a curated global trait matrix of 23 environmental and socioeconomic predictors. Results: We identified socioeconomic factors driving reported tick-borne viruses captured in the database at a country level. Countries that were more likely to report tick-borne viruses had a lower Gini Index (i.e., countries with less inequalities such as Nordic countries), increased dollars spent on pesticide imports, and had institutions (i.e., IVSA chapter) or individuals with agricultural, forestry, or veterinary knowledge (i.e., % of tertiary grads) present. Additional characteristics included countries with a lower percent of population exposed to conflict also had a higher probability of reporting a tick-borne virus. As expected, broad environmental factors such as the Koeppen-Geiger climate classification zone was important and identified Mediterranean climate or humid subtropical climate as environmentally suitable zones for reported tick-borne viruses. Discussion: For environmentally persistent pathogens, the role of ancillary factors mediating reporting must be considered for allocating resources to interventions.

We used log-ratio and generalised linear models to highlight the effects of biotic interactions and environment as drivers of alpha diversity, and generalised dissimilarity models to figure out the relative contribution of space and environment to beta-diversity at different spatial extents. Community-scale alpha diversity was mainly explained by habitat filtering (soil texture) and interspecific competition that limit the number of locally co-existing species. Beta diversity between pairs of communities was mainly explained by distance when comparing communities in similar habitats, by topography and available soil phosphorus when comparing communities in different habitats, and by distance, elevation and climate when comparing all possible pairs of communities. While community composition is determined locally by neutral processes and environmental filtering, biogeographic processes linked to dispersal limitation and adaptation to local environment are the most influential on a regional scale. This highlights the complex interplay of dispersal limitation, biotic interactions and environmental filtering during the process of community assembly."]},

Among the invasive species, mammals have a particularly profound impact on native ecosystems. As primary decomposers of mammalian feces, dung beetles are critical in ecosystem functioning, and their community structure is closely linked to their services. However, the introduction of invasive mammals threatens these beetles and potentially disrupts their ecosystem services. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the resulting changes in communities. We developed a novel population dynamics model focusing on the interactions among mammals, feces, and dung beetles. Our results indicate that such invasions increase the risk of extinction of specialist dung beetles that cannot utilize the feces of invasive mammals. The risk of extinction is particularly high when generalist dung beetles show a preference for native feces, leading to intensified interspecific competition for resources. Additionally,  the extinction risk of specialist dung beetles increases when invasive mammals display irruptive population dynamics. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that non-native mammalian invasions disrupt the coexistence of native dung beetle communities, potentially leading to losses in biodiversity and ecosystem function. These risks should be considered in future empirical studies to evaluate the impact of invasive mammals on dung beetle communities."]},

From advances in analytics and technology, CT-based density estimates of wildlife is an emerging field of research. Most CT-based density methods require an estimate of the size of the viewshed monitored by each CT, a parameter that may be highly variable and difficult to quantify. Here, we developed and tested a standardized field and analytical method allowing us to predict the probability of photographic capture as it varies within CT viewshed. We investigated how capture probability changes due to environmental influences, i.e., vegetation structure, ambient temperature, speed of subject, time of day, in addition to internal factors from CTs themselves, i.e., sensitivity settings, number of photos taken, and CT brand. We then summarize these spatial capture probability kernels into a Realised Viewshed Size (RVS)-the capture-probability corrected size of a CTs viewshed. We found that RVS values are heavily influenced by location-specific environmental factors, i.e., vegetation structure, technological delays associated with CTs themselves, i.e., refractory period, and internal CT settings, i.e., sensitivity, number of photographs taken. We also found that the RVS values computed using our methodology are substantially smaller than reported values in the literature. Imprecision surrounding CT viewshed areas can create propagating bias when implementing CT-based density estimators.

Here we evaluated whether intraspecific trait variability causes considerable differences in trait values measured in two different regions of Europe. We tested whether regionally measured trait data from the Pannonian Ecoregion differ from trait data of the same species originating from Northwestern Europe, by comparing data from the Pannonian Database of Plant Traits (PADAPT) and the LEDA Traitbase. We evaluated six traits of the same set of species: thousand-seed mass (TSM), seed bank persistence index (SBPI), leaf area (LA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf dry mass. We found that trait data from the two databases significantly differed for TSM, SBPI, SLA, and LDMC. Our results indicate that the markedly different climate of the two regions can cause substantial intraspecific trait variation, therefore, the geographical origin of trait data matters in trait-based analyses. The findings corroborate the assumption that regionally measured trait data and building regional databases are essential for reliable regional-scale trait-based studies. We conclude that for studies analysing traits in the Pannonian Ecoregion (and possibly in Easter and Central Europe in general), it is advisable to use PADAPT instead of databases compiling data from regions with markedly different climatic conditions."]},

Gene expression profiling enabled us to compare the effects of these treatments on the brain in a high-resolution manner. There were two main surprises: First, acute and chronic exposure schemes affected largely non-overlapping sets of genes. Second, different pesticides under the same exposure scheme showed more comparable effects than the same pesticide under different exposure schemes. Acute exposure caused up-regulation of stress response mechanisms causing distinct regulatory changes, rather than amplifying the effects of prolonged low-dose exposure that affected predominantly immunity and energy metabolism.

While species distribution modelling is a vital tool in ecological applications, current approaches fail to fully capture the distribution of climatic extremes, particularly of rare events with the most disruptive potential. Especially at the edges of species' ranges, where conditions are already less favourable, predictions might be inaccurate when these extremes are not well represented.\nLocation: Europe.\nTaxon: Tree species.\nMethods: We present a novel approach to integrate extreme events into species distribution models based on the generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution. This distribution, following from the extreme value theory has been established as a valuable tool in analysing climatic extremes, both in an ecological context and beyond. The approach relying on the GEV distribution is broadly applicable, readily transferable across species and relies on widely available data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for 28 European tree species, illustrating its superior ability to fully capture the distribution of climatic extremes compared to state-of-the-art methods.\nResults: We found that incorporating parameters on climatic extremes derived from the GEV distribution increased model performance (AICmodel) and characterized range edges more accurately (AUCedge) compared to competing approaches. However, general AUC values were only marginally increased across the species and study period analysed. Overall, the GEV model predicted a narrower niche for the species included in this study.\nMain conclusions: Incorporating climatic extremes can impact spatial predictions of species distribution models, especially at range margins. We found that using the GEV distribution to characterise extreme variables in SDMs yields the best performance at these distribution edges. Given the importance of range edges for species conservation, a detailed inclusion of extremes in SDMs employed for those applications will help ensure robust conclusions."]},

Applying multivariate autoregressive state-space time series modeling to extensive historical and contemporary monitoring records (spanning 36 to 113 years) of limnological and biological surveys and fishery catches, we explore how shifting ice phenology propagates through a food web over time by modulating thermal profiles and limnological properties in Lake Simcoe, a large, intensely exploited system in southern Ontario, Canada. Analysis shows that increasingly earlier ice breakups, later ice freeze-ups, earlier thermal stratification onset, and later turnover since the early 1980s, attenuated algal production. This in turn, combined with increasingly more abundant invasive species (dreissenids) that promoted greater water clarity over prolonged stratification periods, diminished zooplankton abundances. These limnological changes filtered through plankton communities further modified the population and community dynamics of higher trophic-level species like fish with differential thermal preferences, interactively with time-varying non-climate drivers. Although management interventions–reductions in nutrient loading and fishing effort in particular–in recent decades aided the recoveries of depleted cold-adapted fish populations (including lake trout, lake whitefish, and cisco), their interaction patterns and strengths with species adapted to warmer conditions were reshuffled by advanced timings of ice breakup and delayed timings of ice freeze-up.

We assessed changes in the abundance (2002-2022) of five species from the genus, Sula (Cocos, Blue-footed, Red-footed, Masked, and Nazca Boobies), using a novel compilation of four data sources (at-sea surveys, n=82 observations, records from Southeast Farallon Island, n=600, the California Rare Birds Committee, n=593, and eBird -a citizen science mobile application, n= 20,529), and looked for relationships with the environment, including broad temporal and spatial scale dynamics (El Niño Southern Oscillation), local conditions where the bird was reported, and potential source conditions from Baja California Sur and the Gulf of California. All five species increased in abundance, and all, with the exception of Blue-footed, exhibited a northward range expansion by as much as 6.8 degrees latitude and increased range area of between 235-1013% within the CCE. There was increased abundance during warmer conditions (El Niño and warm SST) for Cocos, Red-footed, Masked, and Nazca Boobies, and all species increased by 692-3015% after the extreme marine heatwaves that began in late 2013.

Detailed, high-quality observations of when plants undergo seasonal transitions such as leaf-out, flowering, and fruiting are critical for tracking causes and consequences of phenology shifts, but these data are often sparse and biased globally. These data gaps limit broader generalizations and forecasting improvements in the face of continuing disturbance. One solution to closing such gaps is to document phenology on field images taken by public participants. iNaturalist, in particular, provides global scale research-grade data and is expanding rapidly. Here we utilize over 53 million field images of plants and millions of human annotations from iNaturalist – data spanning all angiosperms and drawn from across the globe – to train a computer vision model (PhenoVision) to detect the presence of fruits and flowers. PhenoVision utilizes a vision transformer architecture pretrained with a masked autoencoder to improve classification success, and it achieves high accuracy for flower (98.5%) and fruit presence (95%). Key to producing research-ready phenology data is post-calibration tuning and validation focused on reducing noise inherent in field photographs, and maximizing the true positive rate. We also develop a standardized set of quality metrics and metadata so that results can be used effectively by the community. Finally, we showcase how this effort vastly increases phenology data coverage, including regions of the globe where data have been limited before. Our end products are tuned models, new data resources, and an application streamlining discovery and use of those data for the broader research and management community. We close by discussing next steps, including automating phenology annotations, adding new phenology targets, e.g., leaf phenology, and further integration with other resources to form a global central database integrating all in-situ plant phenology resources."]},

However, little is known about the mechanistic basis and functional role of specific forms of EMT in cancer. Here we address this question in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells that enter a dormancy period in response to TGF-β upon disseminating to distant sites. LUAD cells with the capacity to enter dormancy are characterized by expression of SOX2 and NKX2-1 primitive progenitor markers. In these cells, TGF-β induces growth inhibition accompanied by a full EMT response that subsequently transitions into an atypical mesenchymal state of round morphology and lacking actin stress fibers. TGF-β induces this transition by driving the expression of the actin-depolymerizing factor gelsolin, which changes a migratory, stress fiber-rich mesenchymal phenotype into a cortical actin-rich, spheroidal state. This transition lowers the biomechanical stiffness of metastatic progenitors, protecting them from killing by mechanosensitive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. Inhibiting this actin depolymerization process clears tissues of dormant metastatic cells. Thus, LUAD primitive progenitors undergo an atypical EMT as part of a strategy to evade immune-mediated elimination during dormancy. Our results provide a mechanistic basis and functional role of this atypical EMT response of LUAD metastatic progenitors and further illuminate the role of TGF-β as a crucial driver of immune evasive metastatic dormancy."]},

However, the mechanisms by which TECs modulate immune cell population remain unclear, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we investigated how NSCLC cells tweak normal endothelial cells (NECs) into TECs and the subsequent effects on immune regulation. NECs were cocultured with various NSCLC cell lines, using 2D and 3D coculture models to evaluate TEC-mediated effects on immune cells. We show that direct coculture led to significant transcriptomic, proteomic and kinomic alterations in TECs, especially in pro-inflammatory pathways. We identified a downregulation of the co-stimulatory molecule OX40L in TECs compared to NECs, suggesting impaired T-cell proliferation support. While TECs showed a limited effect on CD8+ T-cell activation, TECs supported CD4 T-cells polarization into Treg and Th22 subsets. Moreover, TECs also promoted M2-like macrophages polarization, thereby potentially contributing to the TME immunosuppression. State-of-the-art single-cell RNA sequencing of 3D multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) revealed distinct TEC subpopulations, including an inflammatory subset with UPR signature. The latter was absent in 2D-cultured NECs but present in freshly isolated and 2D-cultured TECs from NSCLC patients. Importantly, we also identified within MCTS a perivascular M2-like macrophage subset, predicted to interact with TECs with MIF and Midkine signaling. In conclusion, TECs in NSCLC tumors play a pivotal role in remodeling the TME immune landscape by promoting immune suppression. This study highlights the complex immunoregulatory functions of TECs within our different in vitro models that mimic aspects of the TME. Our data may provide new insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting TECs or regulatory signaling to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in NSCLC."]},

The anthracycline topoisomerase II inhibitors can induce histone eviction and DNA damage. We performed genome-wide high-resolution mapping of the chemotherapeutic effects of various clinically used anthracycline drugs. ATAC-seq was used to profile the histone eviction effects of different anthracyclines. TOP2A ChIP-seq was used to profile the potential DNA damage regions. Integrated analyses show that different anthracyclines have distinct target selectivity on epigenomic regions, based on their respective ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq profiles.

We further performed Hi-C experiments, and data from K562 cells treated with the selective anthracycline drugs indicate that the 3D chromatin organization is disrupted. Furthermore, AML patients receiving anthracycline drugs showed altered chromatin structures around potential looping anchors, which linked to distinct clinical outcomes.

Here, we further demonstrated that KLF4, a key pluripotency factor, is a direct transcriptional target of Nrf2 in arsenic-exposed human bronchial epithelial cells. ChIP-seq analysis identified multiple Nrf2 binding peaks at the Klf4 gene locus, which overlap with the enhancer markers H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac. Nrf2 knockout reduced both KLF4 expression and enhancer marker enrichment, accompanied by a global decrease in KLF4 binding across the genome. In wild-type (WT) cells, arsenic treatment increased KLF4 binding on genes involved in oncogenic pathways such as STAT3, SOX2, Nrf2, cell growth, Hedgehog, and EMT. We also found that KLF4 engages in a self-feedback loop in response to Nrf2 signaling. Lastly, our data showed that the co-occupancy of Nrf2 and KLF4 is crucial for establishing active enhancer hubs in the genome. These findings suggest that the oncogenic effects of Nrf2 are, in part, mediated by Nrf2 dependent self-amplification of KLF4 expression and function. Thus, targeting both Nrf2 and KLF4 could be a promising therapeutic strategy for eliminating cancer stem-like cells."]},

To overcome this challenge, we engineered a replicating retrovirus (RRV) to deliver a superagonist interleukin-15 receptor-linker fusion protein (RLI) directly to tumor cells, engineering them into local immunotherapy biofactories. This strategy leverages the tumor-selective replication of RRV to achieve localized and sustained RLI expression within the tumor microenvironment. In two orthotopic poorly immunogenic GBM mouse models, intratumoral administration of RRV RLI significantly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival compared to controls, with some mice achieving long-term remission and demonstrating immunological memory upon rechallenge. Transcriptomic and flow cytometric analyses revealed that RRV RLI treatment enhanced infiltration and activation of CD8⁺ T cells and NK cells, and upregulated antigen presentation pathways within the tumor microenvironment. Depletion studies indicated that the therapeutic efficacy of RRV RLI is dependent on both CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells. Notably, combining RRV RLI with the GBM standard of care chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide synergistically improved survival outcomes. Subsequent single-cell RNA and T-cell receptor sequencing identified enhanced effector cell activation, antigen presentation, and clonal T-cell expansion in the combination therapy group.

Using stage-specific Cre models for erythropoiesis, we reveal that Ddx41 knockout in early erythropoiesis is embryonically lethal, while knockout in late-stage terminal erythropoiesis allows mice to survive with normal blood counts. DDX41 deficiency induces a significant upregulation of G-quadruplexes (G4), noncanonical DNA structures that tend to accumulate in the early stages of erythroid precursors. We show that DDX41 co-localizes with G4 on the erythroid genome. DDX41 directly binds to and dissolves G4, which is significantly compromised in MN-associated DDX41 mutants. Accumulation of G4 by DDX41 deficiency induces erythroid genome instability, defects in ribosomal biogenesis, and upregulation of p53. However, p53 deficiency does not rescue the embryonic death of Ddx41 hematopoietic-specific knockout mice. In parallel, genome instability also activates the cGas-Sting pathway, which is detrimental to survival since cGas-deficient and hematopoietic-specific Ddx41 knockout mice are viable without detectable hematologic phenotypes, although these mice continue to show erythroid ribosomal defects and upregulation of p53.

Currently, a variety of miRNA target prediction tools are available, that analyze sequence complementarity, thermodynamic stability, and evolutionary conservation to predict miRNA-target interactions (MTIs) within the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). We propose a concept for further screening of human sequence-based predicted MTIs by considering the disease similarity between miRNAs and genes to establish a prediction database of disease-specific MTIs. We fine-tuned the Sentence-BERT model to calculate the semantic similarity of disease. The method achieved an F1 score of 0.88 in accurately distinguishing human protein-level experimentally (Western Blot, Reporter Assay, etc.) validated MTIs and predicted MTIs. Moreover, this method exhibits exceptional generalizability across different databases. The proposed method was utilized to calculate the similarity of disease in 1,220,904 human MTIs from miRTarbase, miRDB, and miRWalk, involving 6,085 genes and 1,261 pre-miRNAs.

There is growing evidence that, in addition to BAK and BAX, lipids play an important role in pore formation. Towards a better understanding of the lipidic drivers of  apoptotic pore formation in isolated mitochondria, two complementary approaches were taken. Firstly, the lipids released during BAK-mediated pore formation were measured with targeted lipidomics, revealing enrichment of long chain polyunsaturated lysophospholipids (LPLs) in the released fraction. In contrast, the BAK protein was not released suggesting that BAK and LPLs locate to distinct microdomains. Secondly, added cholesterol not only prevented pore formation but prevented the clustering of BAK homodimers. Our data lead us to a model in which BAK clustering triggers formation of a separate microdomain rich in LPLs that can progress to lipid shedding and the opening of a lipid-lined pore. Pore stabilisation and growth may be due to BAK dimers then moving to the pore edge. Our BAK-lipid microdomain model supports the heterogeneity of BAK assemblies, and the observed lipid-release signature gives new insight into the genesis of the apoptotic pore."]},

Most advanced techniques relying on amplitude modulation scheme such as cross amplitude modulation (xAM) and ultrafast amplitude modulation (uAM) combined with Hadamard encoded multiplane wave transmissions have shown efficacy in capturing acoustic signals of gas vesicles (GVs). Nonetheless, uAM sequence requires odd- or even-element transmissions leading to imprecise amplitude modulation emitting scheme, and the complex multiplane wave transmission scheme inherently yields overlong pulse durations. xAM sequence is limited in terms of field of view and imaging depth. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an innovative ultrafast imaging sequence called nonlinear singular value decomposition (SVD) beamforming. Our method demonstrated a contrast imaging sensitivity comparable to the current gold-standard xAM and uAM, while requiring 4.8 times less pulse transmissions. With similar number of transmit pulses, nonlinear SVD beamforming outperforms xAM and uAM in terms of an improvement in signal-to-background ratio of + 4.78 dB and + 8.29 dB respectively. Additionally, our method provides a higher flexibility in terms of the selection of acoustic pressure amplitude compared to the other methods.

It comprises thousands of microtubules (MTs) that build a scaffold around the distal half of the nucleus. The manchette distributes proteins and vesicles during spermiogenesis in a process called intra-manchette transport (IMT). The current hypothesis is that IMT shares many similarities with intra-flagellar transport (IFT) and utilizes both MTs and filamentous actin (F-actin). However, IMT is still poorly understood as direct visualization of IMT complexes is missing, and the presence of F-actin has not been experimentally shown. Here, we use proteomics and cryogenic-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to identify and visualize IMT components. We find that F-actin is an integral part of the manchette with two different spatial organizations, namely bundles and single filaments, providing tracks for transport as well as having structural and mechanical roles. We further uncover that IMT on MTs is mediated by two distinct transport machineries: dynein mediated transport of soluble cargo and dynein independent transport for vesicles. Our results provide new insights into the manchette's function as a transport scaffold, highlighting its significance for the polarization of spermatids during spermiogenesis."]},

Here, we show that the human tRNA methyltransferase TRMT1 can be recognized and cleaved by SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. TRMT1 installs the N2,N2-dimethylguanosine (m2,2G) modification on mammalian tRNAs, which promotes global protein synthesis and cellular redox homeostasis. We find that Mpro can cleave endogenous TRMT1 in human cell lysate, resulting in removal of the TRMT1 zinc finger domain. TRMT1 proteolysis results in elimination of TRMT1 tRNA methyltransferase activity and reduced tRNA binding affinity. Evolutionary analysis shows that the TRMT1 cleavage site is highly conserved in mammals, except in Muroidea, where TRMT1 is likely resistant to cleavage. In primates, regions outside the cleavage site with rapid evolution could indicate adaptation to ancient viral pathogens.  Furthermore, we determined the structure of a TRMT1 peptide in complex with Mpro, revealing a substrate binding conformation distinct from the majority of available Mpro-peptide complexes. Kinetic parameters for peptide cleavage show that the TRMT1(526-536) sequence is cleaved with comparable efficiency to the Mpro-targeted nsp8/9 viral cleavage site. Mutagenesis studies and molecular dynamics simulations together indicate that kinetic discrimination occurs during a later step of Mpro-mediated proteolysis that follows substrate binding. Our results provide new information about the structural basis for Mpro substrate recognition and cleavage, the functional roles of the TRMT1 zinc finger domain in tRNA binding and modification, and the regulation of TRMT1 activity by SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. These studies could inform future therapeutic design targeting Mpro and raise the possibility that proteolysis of human TRMT1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection suppresses protein translation and oxidative stress response to impact viral pathogenesis."]},

In this study, we conducted secretomic analyses of GRASP55 knockout (KO) cells and found a significant increase in lysosome-associated proteins in the extracellular medium. Using the lysosomal beta-hexosaminidase subunit alpha (HEXA) as a model, we found that GRASP55 depletion disrupted normal trafficking and processing of HEXA, resulting in increased secretion of the immature (pro-form) HEXA into the extracellular milieu, along with decreased levels of the mature form and enzymatic activity within the cell. GRASP55 depletion significantly reduced the complex formation between HEXA and mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptors (MPR), despite no overall change in MPR expression.

We applied this platform to investigate the influence of macrophage signaling on fibroblast activation. Fibroblasts cultured on stiff (50 kPa) hydrogels mimicking fibrotic tissue exhibit increased activation as measured by spreading as well as type I collagen and cadherin-11 expression compared to fibroblasts cultured on soft (1 kPa) viscoelastic hydrogels mimicking normal tissue. These trends were unchanged in fibroblasts cultured with macrophage-conditioned media. However, fibroblasts directly co-cultured with M2 macrophages show increased activation, even on soft viscoelastic hydrogels that normally suppress activation. Inhibition of interleukin 6 (IL6) signaling does not change activation in fibroblast-only cultures but ameliorates the pro-fibrotic effects of M2 macrophage co-culture. These results underscore the ability of direct M2 macrophage co-culture to override hydrogel viscoelasticity to promote fibroblast activation in an IL6-dependent manner.

We use simulations and experiments to study the relationship between cryptic pocket opening and dsRNA binding of the IIDs of two other filoviruses, Reston and Marburg. These homologs have nearly identical structures but block different interferon pathways due to different affinities for blunt ends and backbone of the dsRNA. Simulations and thiol-labeling experiments demonstrate that the homologs have varying probabilities of pocket opening. Subsequent dsRNA-binding assays suggest that closed conformations preferentially bind dsRNA blunt ends while open conformations prefer binding the backbone. Point mutations that modulate pocket opening proteins further confirm this preference. These results demonstrate the open cryptic pocket has a function, suggesting cryptic pockets are under selective pressure and may be difficult to evolve away to achieve drug resistance."]},

The standard 2-dimensional vertex model, which successfully describes tissue sheet mechanics in multiple contexts, would in this case predict that the tissue should fluidize via cell neighbor changes. Surprisingly, however, the amnioserosa remains an elastic solid with no such events.

In this study, we investigated the role of the DELE1-HRI axis of integrated stress response (ISR) in regulating mitophagy, a key mitochondrial stress pathway. Our findings show that the ISR suppresses mitophagy under non-depolarizing mitochondrial stress by positively regulating mitochondrial protein import, independent of ATF4 activation. Mitochondrial protein import is regulated by the rate of protein synthesis under both depolarizing and non-depolarizing stress. Without ISR, increased protein synthesis overwhelms the mitochondrial import machinery, reducing its efficiency. Under depolarizing stress, mitochondrial import is heavily impaired even with active ISR, leading to significant PINK1 accumulation. In contrast, non-depolarizing stress allows more efficient protein import in the presence of ISR, resulting in lower mitophagy. Without ISR, mitochondrial protein import becomes severely compromised, causing PINK1 accumulation to reach the threshold necessary to trigger mitophagy. These findings reveal a novel link between ISR-regulated protein synthesis, mitochondrial import, and mitophagy, offering potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction."]},

To characterize the behavioural component of the stability-manoeuvrability relationship, twenty-four participants performed many repetitions of a discrete stepping task involving mid-trial reactive manoeuvres (medial or lateral direction) in a Baseline (no external perturbations) and Perturbed (random mediolateral perturbations applied to their pelvis) environment.

Based on previous free energy simulations, insulin dissociation is thought to involve multiple pathways with comparable free energy barriers. Here, we analyze the mechanism of insulin dimer dissociation using a recently developed computational framework for estimating kinetic statistics from short-trajectory data. These statistics indicate that the likelihood of dissociation (the committor) closely tracks the decrease in the number of (native and nonnative) intermonomer contacts and the increase in the number of water contacts at the dimer interface; the transition state with equal likelihood of association and dissociation corresponds to an encounter complex with relatively few native contacts and many nonnative contacts. We identify four pathways out of the dimer state and quantify their contributions to the rate, as well as their exchange, by computing reactive fluxes. We show that both the pathways and their extents of exchange can be understood in terms of rotations around three axes of the dimer structure.

We use this approach to design binders against a set of therapeutically relevant polar targets (KIT, PDGFRɑ, ALK-2, ALK-3, FCRL5, and NRP1) and find that beta-strand-targeted design yields higher affinities and success rates than unconditioned RFdiffusion.

A co-crystal structure of one such design in complex with the KIT receptor is nearly identical to the computational design model confirming the accuracy of the design approach.

The IL-1β induced proteome alterations indicated metabolic, transcriptional, and translational activation, including inflammatory marker proteins such as NOS1, THBS1, and STING1. The induction of mitochondrial proteins and the formation of numerous lysolipids indicated an increase in beta-oxidation. In addition to the NF-κB and STAT signaling pathways, which are characteristic of inflammatory activation, the MAP and AKT kinase signaling pathways were found to be strongly induced. Six hours after treatment, the observed signaling events exhibited a notable decline, nearly returning to their initial states after 24 hours. It is noteworthy that nearly all of these signaling activities were also observed in cells treated with Dex alone. Additionally, the proteome exhibited transient alterations, which included proteins otherwise characteristic of an inflammatory response, such as MMP3 and NFKB2. Activation of the kinase PIKFYVE was apparently specific for dexamethasone but constituted a minority of the total phosphorylation events. Only after 24 hours was the induction of proteins characteristic of glucocorticoids, such as TSC22D3 and MAOA, observed. The analysis of the effects of dexamethasone on the background of established inflammatory signaling verified the known inhibitory functions and resulted in the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins and oxylipins, but hardly affected the signaling events involving MAP and AKT kinases.

This approach replicates the process of manual organoid culture but with superior stability and reproducibility. Utilizing this platform, we screened 2,802 compounds on neuroendocrine cervical cancer organoids, a rare malignancy with significant unmet clinical needs. We identified 7 top hits that display strong anti-tumor effects with remarkably low half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC", ") and validated the in vivo efficacy of Quisinostat 2HCl. Additionally, we demonstrated that employing 3D ECM-encapsulated organoid cultures for HTS, rather than suspended cultures, provides optimal conditions for drug discovery. Our wp3D-OAHTS platform significantly improves the rapidity and efficiency of new drug discovery for rare diseases."]},

Preclinical and clinical data support the importance of wound pH as a biomarker in chronic wound healing, with DFUs typically exhibiting more alkaline pH values when compared to normal healing wounds. In a previous study, we developed a pH-sensing fluorescent bandage based on pyranine-loaded microparticles that were physically immobilized in an alginate hydrogel. Here, we present a second-generation pH-sensing bandage for colorimetric wound diagnostics. Pyranine was adsorbed at high concentrations onto microparticles to enable colorimetric signal detection. This approach leverages pyranine's ability to change color in response to pH variations through proton exchange properties with the wound fluid. The colorimetric properties of our bandage enable signal detection by two methods suited for point-of-care use: a smartphone camera and a cost-effective homebuilt RGB detector. Analyzing the color intensity of the bandage with Red, Green and Blue absorbance values, it is possible to correlate the RGB absorbance to a pH value in the clinically-relevant range to 6.0 to 9.0 in vitro and ex vivo, as the B values decreased with the increase in pH levels, as associated with DFUs. These findings indicate the potential of colorimetric detection using smartphone cameras or home-built absorbance detectors for rapid wound diagnostics at the point-of-care."]},

Bilaterality of amniote embryos becomes recognizable as midline morphogenesis begins at gastrulation, bisecting an embryonic field into the left and right sides, and left-right asymmetry patterning follows. While a series of laterality genes expressed after the left-right compartmentalization has been extensively studied, the laterality patterning prior to and during midline morphogenesis has remained unclear. Here, through a biophysical quantification in a high spatial and temporal resolution, applied to a chick model system, we show that a large-scale bilateral counter-rotating cellular flow, termed as polonaise movements, display left-right asymmetries in early gastrulation. This cell movement starts prior to the formation of the primitive streak, which is the earliest midline structure, and earlier than expression of laterality genes. The cellular flow speed and vorticity unravel the location and timing of the left-right asymmetries. The bilateral flows displayed a Right dominance after six hours since the start of cell movements. Mitotic arrest that diminishes primitive streak formation resulted in changes in the bilateral flow pattern, but the Right dominance persisted. Our data indicate that the left-right asymmetry in amniote gastrula becomes detectable prior to the point when the asymmetric regulation of the laterality signals at the node leads to the left-right patterning. More broadly, our results suggest that physical processes can play an unexpected but significant role in influencing left-right laterality during embryonic development."]},

Beyond cost and delayed graft availability, the patient-specific performance of engineered tissues poses serious concerns on their clinical translation ability. A more exciting paradigm consists in exploiting cell-laid, engineered extracellular matrices (eECM), which can be used as off-the-shelf materials. Here, the regenerative capacity solely relies on the preservation of the eECM structure and embedded signals to instruct an endogenous repair. We recently described the possibility to exploit custom human stem cell lines for eECM manufacturing. In addition to the conferred standardization, the availability of such cell lines opened avenues for the design of tailored eECMs by applying dedicated genetic tools. In this study, we demonstrated the exploitation of CRISPR/Cas9 as a high precision system for editing the composition and function of eECMs. Human mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (hMSC) lines were modified to knockout VEGF and RUNX2 and assessed for their capacity to generate osteoinductive cartilage matrices. We report the successful editing of hMSCs, subsequently leading to targeted VEGF and RUNX2-knockout cartilage eECMs. Despite the absence of VEGF, eECMs retained full capacity to instruct ectopic endochondral ossification. Conversely, RUNX2-edited eECMs exhibited impaired hypertrophy, reduced ectopic ossification and superior cartilage repair in a rat osteochondral defect. In summary, our approach can be harnessed to identify the necessary eECM factors driving endogenous repair. Our work paves the road towards the compositional eECMs editing and their exploitation in broad regenerative contexts."]},

Our data reveal how Kap3 binds via a multipartite interface with Kif3A and Kif3B, and – rather than activating motility directly – provides a platform on which cargo adaptors can engage and occlude the beta-hairpin motif.

Understanding the process by which healthy cells become senescent and develop SASP factors is critical for improving the identification of senescent cells and, ultimately, understanding tissue dysfunction. Here, we reveal how the duration of cellular stress modulates the SASP in distinct subpopulations of senescent cells. We used multiplex, single-cell imaging to build a proteomic map of senescence induction in human epithelial cells induced to senescence over the course of 31 days. We map how the expression of SASP proteins increases alongside other known senescence markers such as p53, p21, and p16INK4a. The aggregated population of cells responded to etoposide with an accumulation of stress response factors over the first 11 days, followed by a plateau in most proteins. At the single-cell level, however, we identified two distinct senescence cell populations, one defined primarily by larger nuclear area and the second by higher protein concentrations. Trajectory inference suggested that cells took one of two discrete molecular paths from unperturbed healthy cells, through a common transitional subpopulation, and ending at the discrete terminal senescence phenotypes. Our results underscore the importance of using single-cell proteomics to identify the mechanistic pathways governing the transition from senescence induction to a mature state of senescence characterized by the SASP."]},

As DNA polymerases progress, negative supercoils accumulate in the wake of the replication fork, thereby impeding fork progression unless the supercoils are resolved topologically. Using super-resolution microscopy combined with spatial distribution analysis, here we describe that SMC5/6-mediated confinement of negative supercoils lies at the basis of releasing them by topoisomerase Top2A. Along with DNA replication, SMC5/6 progressively associates with chromatin and locally increases the density of supercoil clusters behind the fork, allowing Top2A to efficiently target and release the accumulated supercoils. These processes are essential to complete DNA replication prior to mitosis and therefore to ensure genome stability. Remarkably, we found that HeLa cells over-accumulate poorly confined negative supercoils beyond the processing capacity of cellular SMC5/6, which may exemplify the condition associated with genome instability of cancer cells."]},

Total RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, and quantitative immunohistochemistry defined loading-induced changes in gene expression. NicheNet predicted how differentially expressed genes might impact HISMCs and other bowel cells. Results: Loading induced differential expression of 4537 genes in HISMCs. Loaded HISMCs had a less contractile phenotype, with increased expression of synthetic SMC genes, proinflammatory cytokines, and altered expression of axon guidance molecules, growth factors and morphogens. Many differentially expressed genes encode secreted ligands that could act cell-autonomously on smooth muscle and on other cells in the bowel wall.

A key benefit of using peptides is that they are natural substrates for cell-secreted enzymes, which creates the possibility of utilizing cell-secreted enzymes for tuning cell-material interactions. However, these enzymes can also induce unwanted degradation of bioactive peptides in biomaterials, or in peptide therapies. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a widely used, powerful methodology that can separate complex mixtures of molecules and quantify numerous analytes within a single run. There are several challenges in using LC-MS for the multiplexed quantification of cell-induced peptide degradation, including the need for non-degradable internal standards and the identification of optimal sample storage conditions. Another problem is that cell culture media and biological samples typically contain both proteins and lipids that can accumulate on chromatography columns and degrade their performance. However, removing these constituents can be expensive, time consuming, and increases sample variability. Here we show that directly injecting samples onto the LC-MS without any purification enables rapid and accurate quantification of peptide concentration, and that hundreds of LC-MS runs can be done on a single column without a significantly diminish the ability to quantify the degradation of peptide libraries. We also show that column failure is evident when hydrophilic peptides fail to be retained on the column, and this can be easily identified using standard peptide mixtures for column benchmarking. In total, this work introduces a simple and effective method for simultaneously quantifying the degradation of dozens of peptides in cell culture. By providing a streamlined and cost-effective method for the direct quantification of peptide degradation in complex biological samples, this work enables more efficient assessment of peptide stability and functionality, facilitating the development of advanced biomaterials and peptide-based therapies."]},

The CFD-PBPK model captured detailed spatial and temporal variations of these parameters, which offers potential for future integrated/in-silico applications. Minor peaks of odor concentration were observed in the posterior olfactory regions during exhalation, revealing a retro-nasal phenomenon. Location-specific analysis revealed the nostrils and olfactory regions as the most accurate indicators of perceived odor intensity, proving the limitations of rough sensory assessments in the indoor/breathing zone scales. Acetone exhibited distinct absorption and desorption trends during the transitional phase between inhalation and exhalation, owing to the physical properties (diffusion and partition coefficients) that strongly characterize the olfaction dynamics."]},

While there are numerous technologies to isolate EVs in blood and urine, isolating EVs from saliva remains a challenge, as it is highly complex and heterogeneous—cells, debris, and other proteins can all inhibit the isolation of EVs by traditional platforms. Here, we employ the CandyCollect, a lollipop-inspired sampling device with open microfluidic channels, as a non-invasive and patient-friendly alternative for the capture of salivary EVs. The CandyCollect simplifies sample preparation by effectively pre-concentrating EVs on the device surface before EVs are eluted off of the CandyCollect, labeled with cholesterol-tagged oligonucleotides, and subsequently detected by qPCR with primers specific for the tagged oligos to enumerate the relative number of EVs. We demonstrate that downstream EV cargo analysis can be performed using Simoa. Overall, the CandyCollect ushers a new method to capture, enumerate, and analyze salivary EVs."]},

Here we characterize the texture of five plant-based and three animal meats using texture profile analysis and rheology, and report ten mechanical features associated with each product's elasticity, viscosity, and loss of integrity. Our findings suggest that, of all ten features, the stiffness, storage, and loss moduli are the most meaningful and consistent parameter to report, while other parameters suffer from a lack of interpretability and inconsistent definitions.

To better understand the mechanism of viral RNA mutagenesis, it is crucial to elucidate the role of RdRp in replicating across oxidative lesions. In this study, we investigated the RNA synthesis catalyzed by the reconstituted SARS-CoV-2 RdRp past a single 8-oxo-rG. The RdRp-mediated primer extension was significantly inhibited by 8-oxo-rG on the template RNA. During the blockage of the extension reaction, the rate of product release by RdRp was extremely slow, indicating that the RdRp machinery remained bound to the replicating primer/template RNA. Once RdRp was able to bypass 8-oxo-rG, it preferentially incorporated rCMP, with a lesser amount of rAMP opposite 8-oxo-rG. In contrast, RdRp demonstrated greater activity in extending from the mutagenic rA:8-oxo-rG terminus compared to the lower efficiency of extension from the rC:8-oxo-rG pair. Based on steady-state kinetic analyses for the incorporation of rNMPs opposite 8-oxo-rG and chain extension from rC:8-oxo-rG or rA:8-oxo-rG, the relative bypass frequency for rA:8-oxo-rG was found to be seven-fold higher than that for rC:8-oxo-rG.

Using biochemical approaches in yeast, we discovered that mechanochemical forces on the NC regulate CAT tailing. We propose CAT tailing initially operates in an “extrusion mode” that increases NC lysine accessibility for on-ribosome ubiquitination. Thr in CAT tails enhances NC extrusion by preventing formation of polyalanine, which can form α-helices that lower extrusion efficiency and disrupt termination of CAT tailing. After NC ubiquitylation, pulling forces on the NC switch CAT tailing to an Ala-only “release mode” which facilitates nascent chain release from large ribosomal subunits and NC degradation. Failure to switch from extrusion to release mode leads to accumulation of NCs on large ribosomal subunits and proteotoxic aggregation of Thr-rich CAT tails."]},

To address these issues, we employ random matrix theory to analyze the Jacobian matrices of larger networks with robust statistical properties. Our analysis reveals that Turing patterns are more likely to occur by chance than previously thought and that the most robust Turing networks have an optimal size, surprisingly consisting only of a handful of molecular species, thus significantly increasing their identifiability in biological systems. This optimal size emerges from a tradeoff between the highest stability in small networks and the greatest instability with diffusion in large networks.

Two primary mechanisms of cell elimination have been identified in cell competition studies: contact-dependent cell death and mechanical compression-driven apoptosis. While both occur in tissues, their combined impact on population dynamics is unclear. Here we develop a cell-based computational model to study competition between two cell types with differing physical properties. The model integrates cellular mechanics with cell-cycle dynamics, contact-induced apoptosis, and cell extrusion via mechanical stress. Using this model, we explored how differences in physical traits between cell types influence competitive interactions. Our findings show that differences in cell compressibility alone can drive mechanical competition, with stiffer cells outcompeting softer ones in otherwise identical populations. Surprisingly, mutations that reduce cell stiffness, combined with decreased contact inhibition of proliferation, can create a \"soft\" super-competitive mutant. We demonstrate that changes in apoptosis sensitivity, cell adhesion, and cell size significantly affect growth potential and susceptibility to apoptosis. Furthermore, mutant cell colonies require a critical colony size, dependent on cell compressibility, to overtake the surrounding wild-type tissue. For colonies below the critical size, the elimination process is stochastic, driven by a protrusive finger-like instability in the interface between two cells that promote invasion of the supercompetitors."]},

PTO proteins were encapsulated with a coefficient of variation that closely matched protein variations observed in live cells. Using fluorescently labeled KaiB and confocal microscopy, we were able to measure circadian rhythms generated by thousands of encapsulated PTOs at the single-vesicle level for several days as a function of protein concentration and GUV size. We find that PTO fidelity decreased with decreasing levels of encapsulated PTO proteins and in smaller GUVs. We also observed that in encapsulated PTOs, a significant fraction of KaiB localized to GUV membranes like it does in cyanobacteria. A mathematical model that uses empirical bulk concentration and stoichiometry limitations suggests that cyanobacteria overcome challenges to fidelity by expressing high levels of PTO proteins along with the CikA and SasA proteins, which buffer stochastic variations in the levels of KaiA and KaiB, respectively. Further, the model suggests that the transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL) contributes at most a small percentage to the overall fidelity of the cyanobacterial circadian clock under constant conditions but is essential for maintaining phase synchrony.

Here we engineered, characterized, and validated the first genetically encoded biosensors for polyamines, named iPASnFRs. We demonstrate the utility of iPASnFR for detecting polyamine import into mammalian cells, to the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and the nucleus. We demonstrate that these sensors are useful to probe the activity of polyamine transporters and to uncover biochemical pathways underlying the distribution of polyamines amongst organelles. The sensors powered a high-throughput small molecule compound library screen, revealing multiple compounds in different chemical classes that strongly modulate cellular polyamine levels.

We here show that SERPINB5 overexpression prevents PV-IgG-mediated loss of cell-cell adhesion and the loss of DSP from the cell membrane. We mechanistically demonstrate that SERPINB5 loss deregulates TGF-β signalling, a pathway known to destabilize DSP in keratinocytes. TGF-β signalling was also activated in skin biopsies of PV patients and keratinocytes treated with PV autoantibodies, suggesting a contribution to disease. Inhibition of TGF-β activation ameliorated PV-IgG-mediated loss of cell-cell adhesion, increased DSP membrane expression, and prevented PV-IgG-induced blister formation in a human ex-vivo skin model. Together, SERPINB5 modulates DSP and intercellular adhesion through the regulation of TGF-β signalling. Further, TGF-β signalling was identified as a potential target for pemphigus treatment."]},

Various non-selective and β1-selective β-blockers were found to amplify glucose- and glimepiride-induced insulin secretion 1.5-2 fold.

O-fucosylation, which is required for optimal proliferation of Toxoplasma and Dictyostelium, is paralogous to the O-GlcNAcylation of nucleocytoplasmic proteins of plants and animals that is involved in stress and nutritional responses. O-Fuc was first discovered in Toxoplasma using Aleuria aurantia lectin, but its broad specificity for terminal fucose residues on N- and O-linked glycans in the secretory pathway limits its use. Here we present affinity purified rabbit antisera that are selective for the detection and enrichment of proteins bearing fucose-O-Ser or fucose-O-Thr. These antibodies detect numerous nucleocytoplasmic proteins in Toxoplasma, Dictyostelium, and Arabidopsis, as well as O-Fuc occurring on secretory proteins of mammalian and Dictyostelium cells, although the latter are sometimes capped by further glycosylation.

Although many PAK substrates identified are implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a coherent picture of the total effect of PAK activation on the state of the actin cytoskeleton is unclear. We therefore set out to observe and quantify the effect of PAK inhibition on the actin cytoskeleton in greater detail. In Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts, inhibition of PAK kinase activity, either by treatment with small molecule inhibitors or overexpression of mutant PAK constructs leads to the constitutive production of patches of the phosphoinositide PIP3 on the ventral surface of the cell. The formation of these patches remodels the actin cytoskeleton and polarises the cell. From the overexpression of truncated and mutant PAK constructs as well as an in vitro model of PAK recruitment to small GTPases we propose that this is due to a hyper recruitment of PAK and PAK binding partners in the absence of PAK kinase activity. This aberrant production of PIP3 suggests that the kinase activity of class I PAKs acts to downregulate PI3K activity further highlighting class I PAKs as regulators of PI3K activity and therefore the excitability of the actin cytoskeleton."]},

Here, we show that Dip2, a conserved DAG regulator across Fungi and Animalia, has emerged as a modulator of PKC signalling in yeast. Dip2 maintains the level of a specific DAG subpopulation, required for the activation of PKC-mediated cell wall integrity pathway. Interestingly, the canonical DAG-metabolism pathways, being promiscuous, are decoupled from PKC signalling. We demonstrate that these DAG subspecies are sourced from a phosphatidylinositol pool generated by the acyl-chain remodelling pathway.

Calcium ions are essential for cadherin biological activity, but how they act in synergy is still a matter of controversy. We investigated by cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, a biomimetic system consisting of liposomes decorated with the two first E-cadherin extracellular modules, previously reported as functionally essential in junction formation. We showed that E-cadherin extracellular modules 1 and 2 are sufficient to form junctions in presence of calcium. Together with the first adhesive contacts, we observed the formation of cadherin patches and quasi-crystalline structures on the free surface of proteoliposomes suggesting that calcium complexation induces the self-interaction of the E-cadherin extracellular modules 1 and 2 through cis interactions. We propose that these calcium-dependent cadherin nanoplatforms, by facilitating the formation frequency of trans interactions, most probably favor the formation of junctions. We also observed a cooperative effect between trans and cis interactions leading to the protein depletion of liposome surfaces. Additionally, Cryo-electron tomography experiments performed on extracellular E-cadherin modules 1 and 2-mediated junctions revealed the coexistence of different molecular arrangements previously described from crystallography studies. Thus, this study provides a new insight into biophysical mechanisms underlying how calcium binding modulates cadherin adhesive function, in showing that E-cadherin 1 and 2 modules play a key role through their intrinsic ability to form multiple calcium-dependent cis and trans interactions, in the formation of cadherin junctions contributing to the dynamics and plasticity of cadherin-mediated cell junctions."]},

For example, in uniaxially stretched tissue most divisions orient along the stretch axis. This mechanosensitive division orientation can be achieved by distinct mechanisms involving a direct response to force or an indirect response to force via cell shape changes. Cells also generally align divisions along their long axis of interphase shape. Since stretching a tissue elongates cells, uncoupling whether divisions orient in response to force or to cell shape remains challenging. Here, we utilised the Xenopus laevis embryonic animal cap tissue, to which a reproducible external stretch can be applied, to understand mechanosensitive division orientation. We focused on nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA), which is key to spindle orientation. We show that NuMA is dynamically localised to the cell cortex earlier during mitosis in uniaxially stretched tissues. This temporal cortical recruitment of NuMA coincides with the onset and subsequent stretch-induced amplification of spindle oscillations. Additionally, we show that knockdown of NuMA reduces spindle oscillations and disrupts division orientation according to stretch and cell shape. We also show that divisions dynamically align with cell shape under tissue stretch and that this involves a direct response to force via NuMA localisation, rather than an indirect response to force via cell shape changes. Overall, using live tissue imaging, mathematical modelling, and tissue mechanics our results indicate that NuMA fine tunes spindle dynamics and ensures the accurate alignment of divisions with cell shape and anisotropic tension."]},

However, the molecular mechanism leading to this stabilization is not well understood as there is currently no structure of the parallel dimer. To investigate the mutation's mechanism of action, we conducted extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of multiple oligomeric forms of both STAT5B and STAT5B(N642H), including a model for the parallel dimer. The N642H mutation directly affects the hydrogen bonding network within the phosphotyrosine (pY)-binding pocket of the parallel dimer, enhancing the pY-binding interaction. The simulations indicate that apo STAT5B is highly flexible, exploring a diverse conformational space. In contrast, apo STAT5B(N642H) accesses two distinct conformational states, one of which resembles the conformation of the parallel dimer.  The simulation predictions of the effects of the mutation on structure and dynamics are supported by the results of hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry measurements carried out on STAT5B and STAT5B(N642H) in which a phosphopeptide was used to mimic the effects of parallel dimerization on the SH2 domain.

Fibrosis can be mapped non-invasively using late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI). However, fibrosis maps are not currently incorporated into stroke risk calculations or computational electro-mechano-fluidic models. We present multi-physics simulations of left atrial (LA) myocardial motion and hemodynamics using patient-specific anatomies and fibrotic maps from LGE-MRI. We modify tissue stiffness and active tension generation in fibrotic regions and investigate how these changes affect LA flow for different fibrotic burdens. We find that fibrotic regions and, to a lesser extent, non-fibrotic regions experience reduced myocardial strain, resulting in decreased LA emptying fraction consistent with clinical observations. Both fibrotic tissue stiffening and hypocontractility independently reduce LA function, but together, these two alterations cause more pronounced effects than either one alone. Fibrosis significantly alters flow patterns throughout the atrial chamber, and particularly, the filling and emptying jets of the left atrial appendage (LAA). The effects of fibrosis in LA flow are largely captured by the concomitant changes in LA emptying fraction except inside the LAA, where a multi-factorial behavior is observed.

Adiponectin is an adipose-specific plasma protein, secreted from adipocyte with anti-atherogenic and insulin-sensitizing activities.\nPurpose: This study aimed to investigate the relationship of plasma adiponectin levels with metabolic syndrome, related disorders and it's drug repurposing through in silico approach.\nMaterials and Methods: For this study, 269 individuals were recruited with written consent. The participants were selected based on their full medical history, clinical examination, and laboratory reports. Anthropometric measurements as well as blood pressure was measured before sample collection. Fasting blood samples were collected for the estimation of lipid profile, blood glucose, and serum adiponectin levels.\nResults: Our results show that the adiponectin levels in the subjects with Met-S were significantly lower than those of without Met-S (p <0.0001). Among the metabolic syndrome risk factors, adiponectin levels were associated with hypertriglyceridemia and reduced HDL-cholesterol (p<0.0001). Three drugs (Saquinavir, Candesartan and Glimepiride) were suggested to control the plasma adiponectin level in the subjects with Met-S.\nConclusions: Since the plasma adiponectin levels are significantly lower in patients with Met-S, it might be used as diagnostic & prognostic marker for Met-S disorder and adiponectin targeted drugs might be minimize the Met-S of the subjects."]},

This involves capturing all desired biomarkers in a sample with high specificity and transducing the capture events to a detector. However, the signal from biomarkers present at extremely low amounts often falls below the detection limit of typical fluorescence-based methods, making molecular amplification a necessary step. Here, we present a nucleic acid detection assay of a 151-nucleotide sequence specific to antibiotics-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, based on single-molecule fluorescence detection of non-amplified DNA down to the attomolar level, using Trident NanoAntennas with Cleared HOtSpots (NACHOS). Our NACHOS-diagnostics assay leverages a compact microscope with a large field-of-view and cost-efficient components, including microfluidic flow to enhance capturing efficiency. Fluorescence enhancement is provided by DNA origami NanoAntennas, arranged in a dense array using a combination of nanosphere lithography and site-specific DNA origami placement. Our method can detect 200 ± 50 out of 600 molecules in a 100 μL sample volume within an hour. This represents typical number of pathogens in clinical samples commonly detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction but without the need for molecular amplification. We achieve similar sensitivity in untreated human blood plasma, enhancing the practical applicability of the system. Our platform can be adapted to detect shorter nucleic acid fragments that are not compatible with traditional amplification-based technologies. This broadens its potential for diverse diagnostic and healthcare applications, providing a robust and scalable solution for sensitive nucleic acid detection in various clinical settings."]},

However, the conventional approach to discovering splice-modulating ASOs is both laborious and expensive. Here, we describe an alternative paradigm that integrates data-driven RNA structure prediction and community science to discover splice-modulating ASOs.

Both protein source and processing method impact the texture of the final product. We can distinguish three types of mechanical tests to quantify the textural differences between meat and meat analogs: puncture-type, rheological torsion tests, and classical mechanical tests of tension, compression, and bending. Here we compile the shear force and stiffness values of whole and comminuted meats and meat analogs from the two most popular tests for meat, the Warner-Bratzler shear test and the double-compression texture profile analysis. Our results suggest that, with the right fine-tuning, today's meat analogs are well capable of mimicking the mechanics of real meat. While Warner-Bratzler shear tests and texture profile analysis provide valuable information about the tenderness and sensory perception of meat, both tests suffer from a lack of standardization, which limits cross-study comparisons. Here we provide guidelines to standardize meat testing and report the meat stiffness as the single most informative mechanical parameter. Collecting big standardized data and sharing them with the community at large could empower researchers to harness the power of generative artificial intelligence to inform the systematic development of meat analogs with desired mechanical properties and functions, taste and sensory perception."]},

Using Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B theta) as a model, we asked how microbiome species process iron, the quintessential biometal supporting respiration and life as we know it, when iron is provided in complex with protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) as heme. Canonical pathways for reclaiming heme-iron from host cells or the diet require O2, which is unavailable in the GI tract and many pathological microenvironments. HmuS, a homolog of cobalamine- (vitamin B12) and chlorophyll-building chelatases, is widespread in anaerobic microbial ecosystems. In this work, we provide direct physiological, biochemical, and structural evidence for the anaerobic removal of iron from heme by HmuS, a de-chelatase that deconstructs heme to PPIX and Fe(II). We show that heme can be used as a sole iron source by B theta, yielding PPIX, and that hmuS inactivation under these conditions is lethal. Iron removal from heme depends on the B theta membrane fraction, NADH, and O2 exclusion. Absorbance spectra indicate that heterologously expressed HmuS is isolated with a non-substrate heme bound and can accommodate multiple heme equivalents under saturating conditions. Solution of the cryoEM structure reveals heme and two cations at sites that are conserved across the HmuS family and the chelatase superfamily, respectively. The proposed structure-based mechanism for iron removal further links biosynthetic and biodegradative pathways for heme, chlorophyll, and vitamin B12, 3 ancient and biologically crucial metallocofactors."]},

In rodents, social discrimination relies on memory and recognition of individual-specific cues, known as individual signatures. While olfactory signals are central, other sensory cues - such as auditory, visual, and tactile inputs - also play a role. However, little research has explored the fine discrimination of individuals with overlapping cues, such as siblings or cohabitating mice. This study investigates whether mice can discriminate between two closely related individuals: siblings from the same litter and cage. We tested the hypothesis that it would be more challenging for mice to distinguish between siblings than between unrelated mice due to shared cues. Moreover, social cognitive impairments are common in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), where difficulties in recognizing faces and voices progressively disrupt social interactions in patients. Using a mouse model of AD (Tg2576), known for the progressive onset of cognitive deficits, we assessed whether the ability to discriminate between siblings is preserved in pre-symptomatic animals. Thus, we first demonstrated that male and female C57BL6/J mice can discriminate siblings, regardless of sex. Then, we revealed that pre-symptomatic 3-month-old Tg2576 mice exhibit impairments in subtle social memory, while their general social memory remains unaffected. Hence, we demonstrate that the inability to perform fine social discrimination is an early cognitive impairment that arises before other well-documented memory abnormalities in this AD mouse model."]},

Using a unique large dataset, acquired in a natural environment, we observed that signature whistles exhibit variations in their frequency contours. Unsupervised clustering revealed that signature whistles could be classified into sub-categories (signature whistle variants). The existence of these categories, and their independence on the emitter dolphin, indicate that these variations are not random. Analysis of pairwise interactions between sub-categories revealed a clustered structure similar to that of their social hierarchy. Network analysis of this structure showed that whistle sub-categories had different functional roles: some acted as hubs, others as bridges, and certain were used for turn-taking between the main whistle categories.

HECMTP readily dissolves in green solvents and can be fabricated as coatings or films with tunable thicknesses. HECMTP coatings effectively scavenge hydrogen peroxide, resulting in conversion of thioether groups to sulfoxide groups on the polymer chain. Oxidation-driven, hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic transitions that are isolated to the surface of HECMTP coatings under physiologically relevant conditions increase wettability, decrease stiffness, and reduce protein adsorption to generate a non-fouling interface with minimal coating delamination or swelling. HECMTP can be used in diverse optical applications and permits oxidation-responsive, controlled drug release. HECMTP films are non-resorbable in vivo and evoke minimal foreign body responses.

We assessed how individuals altered their behavior depending on the odors present during the assay: either just female odors (Fem condition) or female odors in addition to the odors of potential competitors, other males (Fem+Male condition). Using this repeated-measures design, we evaluated two distinct cohorts of individuals: males exposed to the odor of familiar competitors in the Fem+Male condition (Familiar odor cohort), and males exposed to the odor of unfamiliar competitors in the Fem+Male condition (Unfamiliar odor cohort). While dominants and subordinates did not differ in their baseline vocal production or response to squeaks, all groups reduced their vocal production in response to BBV playback, and the addition of unfamiliar male odor prompted mice to decrease their baseline levels of calling and decrease the complexity of their vocal repertoire. Importantly, this effect of additional male odor was not present when individuals were presented with male odor familiar to them. These findings suggest that mice alter their vocal behavior during courtship interactions in response to cues that indicate the presence of potential competitors, and this response is modulated by the familiarity of these competitor cues."]},

In cognitive science, a crucial role is indicated, which intervenes moderately with others and adjusts the whole balance without interrupting their main smooth interactions, using an experimental task. It suggests that the third role and related playing supports to coordination. This is similar to off-ball movements in team sports, which are not involved directly with the ball and are focused on mainly in sports science because common statistical data do not reflect. A new perspective for discussing coordination has arisen because existing theories, such as synchronization, cannot explain the mentioned role; however, there is room for its usefulness. Therefore, this study applied the experimental findings to the sports field. We designed a 3-on-3 basketball game in which the relevant offensive role is key and introduced it to the practice of the university team as a pilot study. Participants repeatedly engaged in the mini-game, and the playing on the offensive team was compared before and after receiving tips on this role. Consequently, in the bins of the relatively large distance between the participant required in this role and each defensive player, the frequencies after the tips were significantly higher, and the winning rate on the offensive team improved temporarily. It suggests that the spacing skill, which indicates a reasonable distance for intervening with the other offensive players, emerged. This study may provide findings that satisfy usefulness and ecological validity, and make an educational contribution about giving the tips of off-ball movements."]},

Yet the mechanisms driving adaptive behavior have predominantly been studied in separate asocial and social contexts, with an integrated framework remaining elusive. Here, we use a collective foraging task in a virtual Minecraft environment to integrate these two fields, by leveraging automated transcriptions of visual field data combined with high-resolution spatial trajectories. Our behavioral analyses capture both the structure and temporal dynamics of social interactions, which are then directly tested using computational models sequentially predicting each foraging decision. These results reveal that adaptation mechanisms of both asocial foraging and selective social learning are driven by individual foraging success (rather than social factors). Furthermore, it is the degree of adaptivity---of both asocial and social learning---that best predicts individual performance. These findings not only integrate theories across asocial and social domains, but also provide key insights into the adaptability of human decision-making in complex and dynamic social landscapes."]},

To carry out these behaviors, the nervous system internally reweights controller gains, putting more emphasis on those with the least uncertainty, e.g. in a Bayesian framework. Meanwhile, as sensory uncertainty increases, animals produce more vigorous active sensing movements. To better understand the link between these two complementary processes—multisensory reweighting and active sensing—we studied how the weakly electric glass knifefish ", " alters its movement dynamics under parametric manipulations of illumination. We hypothesized a concomitant switch in both active sensing (an overt behavior) and multisensory reweighting (an internal control computation). To test this, we varied illumination levels from 0.1 to 210 lx as fish tracked a moving refuge. We discovered that in a neighborhood of a critical threshold (on the order of 1 to 10 lx), small increases in illumination led to dramatic changes in both active sensing and multisensory control, specifically in 1) steep reductions in fish head and tail movements and 2) decreased refuge tracking phase lag. Outside of this threshold, large changes in illumination only caused mild changes in behavior. A control-theoretic model that dynamically modulates the weights of vision and electrosense due to illumination changes explains the changes in closed-loop behavior in our experiments. Our findings enhance our understanding of active sensing, multisensory reweighting, and locomotor control."]},

It has been shown how the efficient spread of adaptive information within groups can pro-vide benefits which increase with group size. Little is known, however, to which extent groups also amplify maladaptive information such as false alarms and whether such costs reduce or even nullify the above benefits. Here, we investigated fish shoals in the wild that responded collectively with escape dives when attacked by birds. We analysed the response of shoals in reaction to hard-to-detect bird attacks and similar but harmless flybys as a func-tion of shoal size. With increasing shoal size fish increasingly detected predator attacks (true positives) while their false alarms remained constant. Therefore, larger shoals became better at correctly classifying potentially dangerous stimuli rather than becoming more sensitive to all stimuli potentially related to attacks. In addition, decision time decreased with increasing shoal size. Larger shoals were thus able to mitigate two major trade-offs inherent in solitary decision making: the trade-off between true and false positives and the trade-off between speed and accuracy. We report performance increases at shoal sizes of tens of thousands of fish and pose challenges for the modelling of the underlying mechanisms."]},

Mitochondria, crucial for stress adaptation and energy production, may link psychosocial stress to its biological effects, especially during pregnancy when energy demands significantly increase. This study explores two mitochondrial markers-circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf-mtDNA) and Growth Differentiation Factor-15 (GDF15)-as potential mitochondrial health indicators linking maternal distress to pregnancy outcomes in two longitudinal studies from the USA and Turkey.\nMethods: We analyzed biological, demographic, and psychological data from women in two pregnancy studies: EPI (N=187, USA, Mean age=29.6(SD=6.2) and BABIP (N=198, Turkey, Mean age=32.4(SD=4.0)). Data were collected at multiple time points during the perinatal period, including late 2nd and 3rd trimester, with EPI also including additional data at early 2nd trimester and 4-14 months postpartum. Prenatal maternal psychological distress was measured as perceived stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Plasma cf-mtDNA and GDF15 levels were assessed using qPCR and ELISA, respectively. Statistical analyses included Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, Spearman correlations, and Mann-Whitney tests.\nResults: Plasma cf-mtDNA levels did not change significantly during pregnancy in either study. Plasma GDF15 levels increased from early to late pregnancy in both studies and significantly decreased postpartum in EPI. Perinatal maternal distress in the late 2nd and 3rd trimesters was not associated with cf-mtDNA or GDF15 in either study. Metabolic distress, measured as higher pre-pregnancy BMI, was negatively correlated with GDF15 in the late 2nd trimester in EPI and showed a similar trend in BABIP. Similarly, higher maternal psychological distress in the early 2nd trimester were associated with lower cf-mtDNA and a trend for lower GDF15 in EPI. Finally, higher pre-pregnancy BMI and maternal distress in late pregnancy were linked to a smaller decline in GDF15 from late pregnancy to postpartum in EPI, suggesting an interaction between metabolic stress, prenatal distress and post-pregnancy physiological recovery. \nConclusions: This study identified distinct patterns of plasma cf-mtDNA and GDF15 levels during the perinatal period across studies from two countries, revealing unique associations between maternal characteristics, prenatal distress, and pregnancy outcomes, suggesting that maternal distress can interact with energy mobilization during pregnancy."]},

However, evidence regarding regional muscle activation remains controversial, primarily because information derived solely from surface electromyograms (sEMG) amplitude does not necessarily provide an accurate estimate of neural drive to the muscle. To address this limitation, this study investigated whether there are proximodistal differences in the motor unit properties of the biceps femoris long head during isometric hip extension and knee flexion tasks. Methods: Seventeen resistance-trained males performed isometric knee flexion and hip extension tasks at 20% and 40% of maximal voluntary contraction. High-density sEMG were recorded from the proximal and distal regions of the biceps femoris long head and decomposed into individual motor units. Central motor unit properties (mean discharge rate, discharge rate variability, recruitment and de-recruitment thresholds) and peripheral properties (motor unit action potential amplitude and conduction velocity) were analyzed. Bipolar sEMG amplitude was also calculated for each region to simulate traditional sEMG measurements. Results: Bipolar sEMG amplitude, motor unit action potential amplitude and conduction velocity were significantly greater in the distal region during both tasks. In contrast, no proximodistal differences were observed in central motor unit properties. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the increased bipolar sEMG amplitude in the distal region of the biceps femoris long head is driven by peripheral motor unit properties rather than differences in central modulation, likely influenced by intra-muscular variations in muscle mechanics. This emphasizes the limitations of relying solely on sEMG amplitude to infer neural control strategies."]},

Here, we have investigated the effect of human ERG1A (HERG) on [Ca2+]i in C2C12 myotubes, using Fura-2 calcium assays, immunoblot, RT-qPCR, and electrophysiology.  We hypothesized that HERG would modulate L-type calcium channel activity, specifically the Cav1.1 channel known to carry signal from the sarcoplasmic membrane of skeletal muscle to the sarcomeres of the myofibrils.  However, we find that HERG has no effect on the amplitude of L-type channel current nor does it affect the mRNA levels nor protein abundance of the Cav1.1 channel.  Instead we find that, although the rise in [Ca2+]i  (induced by depolarization) is greater in myotubes over-expressing HERG relative to controls, the difference between the KCl-stimulated Ca2+ increase in control and HERG over-expressing cells cannot be accounted for by L-type channel mediated Ca2+ influx, which suggests that HERG could modulate excitation coupled calcium entry (ECCE).  Indeed, the HERG-enhanced increase in [Ca2+]i induced by depolarization is blocked by 2-APB, an inhibitor of ECCE (and SOCE).  Further, we show data suggesting that HERG also modulates the activity of ryanodine receptors, a component of ECCE, as well as store operated calcium entry (SOCE).  Therefore, we investigated the effect of HERG on calsequestrin1, a calcium buffering/binding protein known to modulate ryanodine receptor 1 and store operated Ca2+ entry activities.  Indeed, we find that calsequestrin1 mRNA levels are decreased 0.83-fold (p<0.05) and the total protein abundance is lowered 77% (p<0.05) in myotubes over-expressing HERG relative to controls.  In summary, the data show that ERG1A overexpression modulates [Ca2+]i in skeletal muscle cells by lowering the abundance of the calcium buffering/binding protein calsequestrin1."]},

To investigate the role of altered α-adrenergic stimulation on cardiac function, we developed a short-term exposure model, administering phenylephrine subcutaneously to mice for one week. Compared to vehicle-injected controls, phenylephrine-treated animals exhibited increased ejection fraction, decreased chamber size, diastolic dysfunction and ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of hypertension. Remarkably, these animals developed extensive fibrotic remodeling of the tissue that plateaued at 24 hours and myocyte hypertrophy localized to regions of fibrotic deposition after 3 days of treatment. Transcriptome analyses of purified myocyte and fibroblast populations from these hearts revealed an unexpected role for myocytes in the production of extracellular matrix. Comparison with other models of cardiac stress, including pressure overload hypertrophy and cytokine activation of fibroblasts, identified stimulus-specific transcriptional circuits associated with cardiac pathology. Given the rapid, robust fibrotic response that preceded myocyte hypertrophy, intercellular communication analyses were conducted to investigate fibroblast to myocyte signaling, identifying potential crosstalk between these cells. These studies thoroughly describe and phenotypically characterize a new model of short-term catecholamine stress and provide an atlas of transcriptional remodeling in myocytes and fibroblasts."]},

Alteration of this structure plays a central role in cardiac arrhythmias, notably arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), an inherited genetic disorder of desmosomes.

Here, we investigated CASK regulation of the organization of ID components in normal and pathological contexts. Here, we investigated CASK regulation of the organization of ID components in normal and pathological contexts.\nMethods: We studied the outcomes of CASK depletion in neonatal rat hearts using a cardiac-specific adeno-associated virus strategy. We used conventional and strain echocardiography, hemodynamics, electrocardiography, histology, and gene and protein expression studies to characterize adult rat hearts. We also studied the effects of CASK depletion in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVM), and control and ACM (PKP2+/-) IPS cell-derived CM (hIPS-CM) using proteomics, electron microscopy, high-resolution imaging, mechano-scanning ion conductance microscopy (mechano-SICM), and stress resistance tests. We studied cardiac CASK expression and localization in human ACM and non-transplantable control hearts.\nResults: Depletion of CASK in our multiple experimental models revealed that CASK regulates cardiomyocyte IDs. In rats, CASK depletion improved contractile reserve and compliance. In cultured rat cardiomyocytes, CASK knockdown increased localization of connexin 43 (Cx43) and PKP2 at IDs, resulting in increased contact stiffness. In PKP2+/- hIPS-CMs, CASK expression was increased. CASK depletion in these cells promoted PKP2 accumulation at cell contacts, formation of desmosome-like structures, and stress resistance. In the right ventricles of ACM patients, CASK protein level was also increased and CASK abnormally localized at the ID.\nConclusion: CASK functions as a repressor of ID organization and tissue cohesion, suggesting novel mechanisms for regulating ID structure and function. These observations, along with CASK upregulation and mislocalization in ACM, open up new perspectives on understanding the pathophysiology of ACM and suggest innovative strategies for its treatment."]}
