"the taiwan precision medicine initiative tpmi a project initiated by the academia sinica in collaboration with 16 major medical centers around taiwan has recruited 565390 participants who consented to provide dna samples for genetic profiling and grant access to their electronic medical records emr for studies to develop precision medicine.
access to the emr is both retrospective and prospective allowing researchers to conduct prospective studies over time.
genetic profiling is done with populationoptimized snp arrays for the han chinese populations that enable genetic analyses such as genomewide association phenomewide association and polygenic risk score studies to evaluate common disease risk and pharmacogenetic response.
furthermore the tpmi participants agree to be contacted for future research opportunities related to their genetic risks and receive personalized genetic risk profiles with health management recommendations.
tpmi has established the tpmi data access platform tdap a central database and analysis platform that both safeguards the security of the data and facilitates academic research.
the tpmi is the largest noneuropean cohort that merges genetic profiles with emr in the world.
with a cohort that can be followed over time it can be utilized to validate genetic risk prediction models conduct clinical trials to show the efficacy of riskbased health management and optimize health policies based on genetic risks.
in this report we describe the tpmi study design the population and genetic characteristics of the tpmi cohort and the power it provides to conduct crucial studies in developing precision medicine on a population and personal level.
as han chinese represent almost 20 of the worlds population the results of tpmi studies will benefit 1.4 billion people around the world and serve as a model for developing populationbased precision medicine."
"meiotic recombination produces both crossover and non crossover events that are essential in the history of population genetics and evolution of species.
in arabidopsis thaliana several pathways control the rate and distribution of crossovers.
here by sequencing the four products of a series of tetrads we confirm the antico role of  and .
moreover when one of this gene is mutated complex chimeric gene conversion events associated to crossover are observed suggesting a role of these proteins in limiting the multiple strand invasions.
nothing was known about the factors that could limit or increase ncos.
here we show that  plays a major role in controlling the nco number."
"reproducibility in organ size and shape is a fascinating trait of living organisms.
the mechanisms underlying such robustness remain however to be elucidated.
taking the sepal of arabidopsis as a model we investigated whether variability of gene expression plays a role in variation of organ morphology.
previous work from our team identified cellwall related genes as being enriched among the genes whose expression is highly variable.
we then hypothesized that the variation of measured morphological parameters in cellwall related single knockout mutants could be correlated with the variation in gene expression of the corresponding gene the knockedout gene in wildtype plants.
we analyzed sepal morphology from 16 cellwall mutants and found that unexpectedly the higher a gene is expressed in wild type the more variable the size of the corresponding mutant.
these findings support a contribution of cellwall related genes to the robustness of sepal size."
"the intensity and duration of biological signals encode information that allows a few pathways to regulate a wide array of cellular behaviors.
despite the central importance of signaling in biomedical research our ability to quantify it in individual cells over time remains limited.
here we introduce inscribe an approach for reconstructing signaling history in single cells using endpoint fluorescence images.
by regulating a crispr base editor inscribe generates mutations in genomic target sequences at a rate proportional to signaling activity.
the number of edits is then recovered through a novel ratiometric readout strategy from images of two fluorescence channels.
we engineered human cell lines for recording wnt and bmp pathway activity and demonstrated that inscribe faithfully recovers both the intensity and duration of signaling.
further we used inscribe to study the variability of cellular response to wnt and bmp stimulation and test whether the magnitude of response is a stable heritable trait.
we found a persistent memory in the bmp pathway.
progeny of cells with higher bmp response levels are likely to respond more strongly to a second bmp stimulation up to 3 weeks later.
together our results establish a scalable platform for genetic recording and"
"understanding the pulmonary adaptive immune system of pigs is important as respiratory pathogens present a major challenge for swine producers and pigs are increasingly used to model human pulmonary diseases.
singlecell rna sequencing scrnaseq has accelerated the characterization of cellular phenotypes in the pig respiratory tract under both healthy and diseased conditions.
however combining scrnaseq with recovery of paired t cell receptor tcr α and β chains as well as b cell receptor bcr heavy and light chains to interrogate their repertoires has not to our knowledge been demonstrated for pigs.
here we developed primers to enrich porcine tcr α and β chains along with bcr κ and β light chains and igm iga and igg heavy chains that are compatible with the 10x genomics vdj sequencing protocol.
using these pigspecific assays we sequenced the t and b cell receptors of cryopreserved lung cells from cd1dexpressing and deficient pigs after one or two infections with influenza a virus iav to examine whether natural killer t nkt cells alter pulmonary tcr and bcr repertoire selection.
we also performed paired singlecell rna and receptor sequencing of facssorted t cells longitudinally sampled from the lungs of iavvaccinated and infected pigs to track clonal expansion in response to iav exposure.
all pigs presented highly diverse repertoires.
pigs reexposed to influenza antigens from either vaccination or infection exhibited higher numbers of expanded cd4 and cd8 t cell clonotypes with activated phenotypes suggesting potential iav reactive t cell populations.
our results demonstrate the utility of high throughput singlecell tcr and bcr sequencing in pigs."
"population dynamic models can forecast changes in the abundances of multiple interconnected species which makes them potentially powerful tools for managing ecological communities yet they remain largely underutilised in applied settings.
high data requirements and the ability to only model a narrow range of ecological interactions andor trophic levels together limits their usefulness when faced with complex and datapoor systems where beneficial e.g.
mutualism and harmful e.g.
competition interactions may operate simultaneously within and between species.
we present a model of population dynamics that can describe a wide range of ecological interaction outcomes with a simple unified structure.
species growth rates are constrained by a maximum growth rate parameter which prevents the risk of population explosions even in the case of mutualism.
species interactions are defined by two not mutuallyexclusive interactions matrices that describe the effects of beneficial and harmful interactions respectively together providing the potential for the net effect of interactions between one species and another to switch from beneficial to harmful as population density increases.
this model recreates classic dynamics in twospecies mutualistic competitive and predatorprey scenarios allowing us to model a wide range of trophic levels and interaction types together within the same equation.
the maximum growth rate parameter theoretically based in intrinsic constraints on reproduction can be parameterised from a wide range of sources including natural history historical data and breeding programs.
we illustrate the potential of this model with a datapoor case study of a threatened species and two interacting predators.
this new model is generaliseable to a wide range of natural ecological communities.
its model structure lowers data requirements whilst remaining intuitive and biologically realistic making it an accessible option for predicting communitywide population changes in applied contexts where data is sparse andor uncertain."

"people use the mechanical interplay between stability and manoeuvrability to successfully walk.
during single limb support body states position and velocity that increase lateral stability will inherently resist lateral manoeuvres decrease medial stability and facilitate medial manoeuvres.
although not well understood people can make behavioural decisions exploiting this relationship in anticipation of perturbations or direction changes.
to characterize the behavioural component of the stabilitymanoeuvrability relationship twentyfour participants performed many repetitions of a discrete stepping task involving midtrial reactive manoeuvres medial or lateral direction in a baseline no external perturbations and perturbed random mediolateral perturbations applied to their pelvis environment.
we hypothesized people would make systematic changes in lateral stability dependent on both environment increasing lateral stability in the perturbed environment and anticipated manoeuvre direction reducing lateral stability to facilitate lateral manoeuvres.
participants increased lateral stability in the perturbed environment coinciding with an increase in manoeuvre reaction time for laterally but not medially directed manoeuvres.
moreover we observed lower lateral stability in both environments when people anticipated making a lateral manoeuvre when compared to medial manoeuvres.
these results support the hypothesis that people behaviourally exploit the mechanical relationship between lateral stability and manoeuvrability depending on walk task goals and external environment."
"residual stresses are considered as a significant factor influencing the stressstates in arteries.
these stresses are typically observed through opening angle of a radially cut artery segment often regarded as a primary descriptor of their stressfree state.
however the experimental evidence regarding the stressfree states of different artery layers is scarce.
in this study two experimental protocols each employing different layerseparating sequences were performed on 17 human common carotid arteries the differences between both protocols were found statistically insignificant.
while the media exhibited opening behaviour reduced curvature a contrasting trend was observed for the adventitia curvature indicating its closing behaviour.
in addition to the different bending effect length changes of both layers after separation were observed namely shortening of the adventitia and elongation of the media.
the results point out that not all the residual stresses are released after a radial cut but a significant portion of them is released only after the layer separation.
considering the different mechanical properties of layers this may significantly change the stress distribution in arterial wall and should be considered in its biomechanical models."
"understanding deaths and lifedeath boundaries of cells is a fundamental challenge in biological sciences.
in this study we present a theoretical framework for investigating cell death.
we conceptualize cell death as a controllability problem within dynamical systems and compute the lifedeath boundary through the development of “stoichiometric rays”.
this method utilizes enzyme activity as control parameters exploiting the inherent property of enzymes to enhance reaction rates without affecting thermodynamic potentials.
this approach facilitates the efficient evaluation of the global controllability of models.
we demonstrate the utility of our framework using its application to a toy metabolic model where we delineate the lifedeath boundary.
the formulation of cell death through mathematical principles provides a foundation for the theoretical study of cellular mortality."
"many of the biosynthetic pathways for ribosomal synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide ripp natural products make use of multidomain enzymes with separate recruitment and catalysis domains that separately bind and modify peptide substrates.
this “division of labor” allows ripp enzymes to use relatively open and promiscuous active sites to perform chemistry at multiple residues within a peptide substrate seemingly regardless of the surrounding context.
defining measuring and predicting the seemingly broad substrate promiscuity of ripps necessitates high throughput assays capable of assessing activity against very large libraries of peptides.
using mrna display a high throughput peptide display technology we examine the substrate promiscuity of the ripp cyclodehydratase lynd.
the vast substrate profiling that can be done with mrna display enables the construction of deep learning models for accurate prediction of substrate processing by lynd.
these models further inform on epistatic interactions involved in enzymatic processing.
this work will facilitate the further elucidation of other ripp enzymes and enable their use in the modification of mrna display libraries for selection of modified peptidebased inhibitors and therapeutics."

we assembled a highquality chromosomescale reference genome of  cf.
by combining pacbio omnic and illumina technologies.
the size of the assembled genome is 956.58 mb with a n50 scaffold length of 43 mb which includes 92.3  complete actinopterygii benchmarking universal singlecopy orthologs.
98.96  of the assembly sequence was assigned to 23 chromosomelevel scaffolds with a gccontent of 42.83 .
repetitive elements account for 53.08  of the genome.
the chromosomelevel genome contained 26404 transcripts with 23210 multiexons of which 26260 genes were functionally annotated.

"many widespread invasive plant species express high phenotypic variation across novel environments providing a unique opportunity to examine ecological and evolutionary dynamics under global change.
however biogeographical studies often lack information about the origin of introduced populations limiting our understanding of postintroduction evolution of introduced species in the new range.
here we assessed the responses of reynoutria japonica from 128 populations spanning three latitudinal transects in the native ranges of china and japan and the introduced ranges of north america and europe.
when grown in two common gardens in the native range plants from introduced populations in north america and europe differed in almost all traits from those from native chinese populations but were similar to plants from native japanese populations.
compared to chinese populations north american european and japanese populations expressed lower trait values and plasticity in most traits.
however plants from both introduced ranges and from japanese populations expressed higher clonality and plasticity in clonality than plants from chinese populations.
in addition introduced populations expressed higher plasticity in clonality but lower plasticity in basal diameter compared to japanese populations.
our study showed heritable differences in phenotypes between plants from the native ranges of japan and china and those from the introduced ranges were similar to the putative source of origin in japan.
however we found that introduced populations may have evolved higher plasticity in clonal growth.
our findings emphasize the critical role of clonality and plasticity in invasion success demonstrating the importance of discriminating between source and nonsource native populations to identify ecological and evolutionary responses of invasive plants to novel environments."
"the majority of highly polymorphic genes are related to immune functions and with over 100 alleles within a population genes of the major histocompatibility complex mhc are the most polymorphic loci in vertebrates.
how such extraordinary polymorphism arose and is maintained is controversial.
one possibility is heterozygote advantage ha which can in principle maintain any number of alleles but biologically explicit models based on this mechanism have so far failed to reliably predict the coexistence of significantly more than ten alleles.
we here present an ecoevolutionary model showing that evolution can result in the emergence and maintenance of more than 100 alleles under ha if the following two assumptions are fulfilled first pathogens are lethal in the absence of an appropriate immune defence second the effect of pathogens depends on host condition with hosts in poorer condition being affected more strongly.
thus our results show that ha can be a more potent force in explaining the extraordinary polymorphism found at mhc loci than currently recognized."
"background the metabolic syndrome mets is a cluster of some interrelated common clinical disorders including central obesity dyslipidemia hypertension and glucose intolerance.
central obesity accompanied by insulin resistance is a key factor for the development of metabolic syndrome.
adiponectin is an adiposespecific plasma protein secreted from adipocyte with antiatherogenic and insulinsensitizing activities.
purpose this study aimed to investigate the relationship of plasma adiponectin levels with metabolic syndrome related disorders and its drug repurposing through in silico approach.
materials and methods for this study 269 individuals were recruited with written consent.
the participants were selected based on their full medical history clinical examination and laboratory reports.
anthropometric measurements as well as blood pressure was measured before sample collection.
fasting blood samples were collected for the estimation of lipid profile blood glucose and serum adiponectin levels.
results our results show that the adiponectin levels in the subjects with mets were significantly lower than those of without mets p 0.0001. among the metabolic syndrome risk factors adiponectin levels were associated with hypertriglyceridemia and reduced hdlcholesterol p0.0001.
three drugs saquinavir candesartan and glimepiride were suggested to control the plasma adiponectin level in the subjects with mets.
conclusions since the plasma adiponectin levels are significantly lower in patients with mets it might be used as diagnostic  prognostic marker for mets disorder and adiponectin targeted drugs might be minimize the mets of the subjects."
"pigs are among the most essential sources of highquality protein in human diets.
structural variants svs are a major source of genetic variants associated with diverse traits and evolutionary events.
however the current linear reference genome of pigs limits the presentation of position information for svs.
in this study we generated a pangenome of pigs and a genome variation map of 599 deepsequenced genomes across eurasia.
moreover a sectionwide gene repertoire was constructed which indicated that core genes were more evolutionarily conserved than variable genes.
subsequently we identified 546137 svs their enrichment regions and relationships with genomic features and found significant divergence across eurasian pigs.
more importantly the pangenomedetected svs could complement heritability estimates and genomewide association studies based only on single nucleotide polymorphisms.

here we investigate the existence of cellintrinsic cellscale signalling  in the  pupal wing.
we use conditional and restrictive expression tools to spatiotemporally manipulate core protein activity combined with quantitative measurement of core protein distribution polarity and stability.
our results provide evidence for a robust cellscale signal while arguing against mechanisms that depend on depletion of a limited pool of a core protein or polarised transport of core proteins on microtubules.
furthermore we show that polarity propagation across a tissue is hard highlighting the strong intrinsic capacity of individual cells to establish and maintain planar polarity."
"splicemodulating antisense oligonucleotides asos are precision rnabased drugs that are becoming an established modality to treat human disease.
previously we reported the discovery of asos that target a novel putative intronic rna structure to rescue splicing of multiple pathogenic variants of f8 exon 16 that cause hemophilia a. however the conventional approach to discovering splicemodulating asos is both laborious and expensive.
here we describe an alternative paradigm that integrates datadriven rna structure prediction and community science to discover splicemodulating asos.
using a splicingdeficient pathogenic variant of f8 exon 16 as a model we show that 25 of the topscoring molecules designed in the eterna openaso challenge have a statistically significant impact on enhancing exon 16 splicing.
additionally we show that a distinct combination of asos designed by eterna players can additively enhance the inclusion of the splicingdeficient exon 16 variant.
together our data suggests that crowdsourcing designs from a community of citizen scientists may accelerate the discovery of splicemodulating asos with potential to treat human disease."
"the obligate intracellular bacterium chlamydia alternates between two functional forms during its developmental cycle elementary body eb and reticulate body rb.
however the molecular mechanisms governing the transitions between these forms are unknown.
here we present evidence cyclic diamp cdiamp is a key factor in triggering the transition from rb to eb i.e.
secondary differentiation in the chlamydial developmental cycle.
by overexpressing or knocking down expression of cdiamp synthase genes we made strains producing different levels of cdiamp which we linked to changes in secondary differentiation status.
increases in cdiamp resulted in an earlier increase in transcription of ebassociated genes and this was further manifested in earlier production of ebs.
in contrast when cdiamp levels were decreased secondary differentiation was delayed.
based on these data we conclude there is a threshold level of cdiamp needed to trigger secondary differentiation in chlamydia.
this is the first study to identify a mechanism by which secondary differentiation is initiated in chlamydia and reveals a critical role for the second messenger signaling molecule cdiamp in this process."
"the ratio of predatortoprey biomass density is not constant along ecological gradients denser ecosystems tend to have fewer predators per prey following a scaling relation known as the predatorprey power law.
the origin of this surprisingly general pattern particularly its connection with environmental factors and predatorprey dynamics is unknown.

"a major challenge for undergraduate students engaged in research is reading scientific literature.
this is especially true for students engaged in biophysics research where many of the concepts definitions and experimental methodologies discussed may be beyond the material covered in standard undergraduate courses.
without specific guidance on how to read journal articles students can become overwhelmed which may lead to students reading fewer papers and not engaging with the scientific literature related to their research.
to help undergraduate students effectively engage with scientific papers we have developed a guided reading protocol that combines prereading strategies structured notetaking and the use of chatgpt.
using chatgpt in this protocol allows students to clarify unfamiliar terms and concepts in an interactive way that helps them to integrate the paper’s content into their own understanding.
to test the impact of this protocol participants in this study were given an initial survey to determine their comfort and experience with reading scientific literature.
after this they were given an abridged biophysics paper and the chatgpt assisted guided reading protocol.
the chatgpt transcripts were analyzed using open coding and the students were given a poststudy survey to determine how they felt about their experience using chatgpt.
we found that most students do not appear to engage with the literature regularly which may be due to barriers they encounter in terms of new and unknown content.
analyzing their conversations with the chatbot we observed that students asked for definitions explanations of unknown concepts summaries of text or their own understanding and simplifications of the text.
overall students reported in the postimplementation survey that using chatgpt was a positive experience and all students reported that they expected to use chatgpt in the future when reading scientific literature.
from this work we believe that this new chatbot assisted reading protocol may be a way to keep novice biophysics students from becoming discouraged when they begin reading scientific literature and help keep them engaged with the current literature in the field."
"rising temperatures due to global warming can negatively impact rice grain quality and yield.
this study investigates the effects of increased warmer night temperatures wnt a consequence of global warming on the quality of rice kernel particularly grain chalkiness.
by integrating computational and experimental approaches we used a rice grain metabolic network to discover the metabolic factors of chalkiness.
for this we reconstructed the rice grain genomescale metabolic model gsm iosa3474g and incorporated transcriptomics data from three different times of the day dawn dawn 7h and dusk for both control and wnt conditions with iosa3474g.
three distinct growth phases anoxia normoxia and hyperoxia were identified in rice kernels from the gsms highlighting the grainfilling pattern under varying oxygen levels.
we predicted histidine as a marker of normoxia during which kernel chalkiness occurs.
moreover we proposed tyrosine as a marker for the hyperoxic growth phase.
we also proposed a potential link between monodehydroascorbate reductase an enzyme with evolutionary significance dating back to the carboniferous era in regulating the hyperoxic growth phase.
metabolic bottleneck analysis identified nucleoside diphosphate kinase as a central regulator of metabolic flux under different conditions.
these findings provide targeted insights into the complex metabolic network governing rice grain chalkiness under wnt conditions.
integration of gsm and transcriptomics data enhanced our understanding of the intricate relationship between environmental factors metabolic processes and grain quality and also offer markers that can be useful to develop rice with improved resilience."
"diatoms are a major phylum of microalgae playing crucial ecological roles.
they derive from secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga by an unknown heterotrophic eukaryote leading to a complex intracellular organization.
in response to unfavorable conditions stress diatoms store oil in lipid droplets ld raising interest for applications in particular biofuels.
in spite of numerous investigations aiming to increase their oil content ld biogenesis mechanisms in these organisms remain poorly understood.
in this study we functionally characterized the homolog of seipin a major actor of ld biogenesis in the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum.
ptseipin shares conserved structural features with other seipins yet presents unique characteristics that appear common to diatoms and more broadly stramenopiles.
we provide evidence that stramenopiles seipins were inherited from the host during secondary endosymbiosis.
the localization of ptseipin highlights that ld biogenesis can arise simultaneously from the endoplasmic reticulum er and the plastids most external membrane.
finally the knockout of ptseipin leads to a strong increase of tag accumulation a feature that is not observed in other organisms and is greatly enhanced following high light exposure.

building on our prior research establishing nuclear speckles as a pivotal membraneless organelle responsible for global proteostasis transcriptional control we aim to alleviate proteinopathies through nuclear speckle rejuvenation.
we identified pyrvinium pamoate as a smallmolecule nuclear speckle rejuvenator that enhances protein quality control while suppressing yap1 signaling via decreasing the surfaceinterfacial tension of nuclear speckle condensates through interaction with the intrinsically disordered region of nuclear speckle scaffold protein son.
in preclinical models nanomolar pyrvinium pamoate alleviated retina degeneration and reduced tauopathy by promoting autophagy and ubiquitinproteasome system in a sondependent manner without causing cellular stress.
aberrant nuclear speckle morphology reduced protein quality control and increased yap1 activity were also observed in human tauopathies.

"humans and other groupliving animals tend to distribute their social effort disproportionately.
individuals predominantly interact with a small number of close companions while maintaining weaker social bonds with less familiar group members.
by incorporating this behaviour into a mathematical model we find that a single parameter which we refer to as social fluidity controls the rate of social mixing within the group.
we compare the social fluidity of 13 species by applying the model to empirical human and animal social interaction data.
to investigate how social behavior influences the likelihood of an epidemic outbreak we derive an analytical expression of the relationship between social fluidity and the basic reproductive number of an infectious disease.
for highly fluid social behaviour disease transmission is revealed to be densitydependent.
for species that form more stable social bonds the model describes frequencydependent transmission that is sensitive to changes in social fluidity."
"background the destruction of mitochondrial function during sepsisinduced acute lung injury sepsisali can lead to tissue cell damage and organ dysfunction.

methods 76 healthy donors and 89 sepsis patients were included.
the levels of cs were determined using elisa.
we established a cecal ligation and puncture clp model of sepsis to evaluate the effects of cs on lung injury by lung macrophagesspecific cs knockdown or cs inhibitors.
isolated mouse lung macrophages were stimulated with lps to observe the impact of cs overexpression and knockdown on tca cycle.
results in sepsis patients cs was expressed at low levels and positively correlates with lung function parameters.
in sepsis mice knockdown cs or inhibiting its expression exacerbated lung injury and oxidative stress.
in macrophages inhibiting cs expression affected tca cycle and worsened cell apoptosis while overexpressing cs promoted tca cycle alleviating cell apoptosis enhancing cellular energy production and reducing oxidative stress levels.

it requires modest computing resources and little prior knowledge of the recombination and mutation maps and is robust to sequencing error and gene conversion.
we illustrate the statistical and computational advantages of inferno over previous approaches using a range of simulation scenarios.
in particular we demonstrate the ability of inferno to exploit biobankscale datasets for accurate inference of rapid population size changes in the recent past.
we also apply inferno to worldwide human data finding remarkable similarities in inferences from different populations in the same region.

"bacteriophages are viruses infecting bacteria.
the vast majority of them bear a tail allowing host recognition cell wall perforation and dna injection into the host cytoplasm.
using electron cryomicroscopy cryoem and single particle analysis we determined the organisation of the tail proximal extremity of siphophage t5 that possess a long flexible tail and solved the structure of its tail terminator protein trp p142 trp142.
it allowed to confirm the common evolutionary origin between t5 trpp142 and other known or putative trps from siphophages myophages and bacterial taillike machines despite very poor sequence conservation.
by also determining the structure of t5 tail proximal extremity after interaction with t5 bacterial receptor fhua we showed that no conformational changes occur in trpp142 and confirmed that the infection signal transduction is not carried by the tube itself.
we also investigated the location of t5 tail completion protein tcp p143 tcpp143 and showed thanks to a combination of cryoem and structure prediction using alphafold2 that it is not located at the capsidtotail interface as suggested by its position in the genome but instead very unexpectedly on the side of t5 tail tip and that it appears to be monomeric.
based on structure comparison with other putative tcps predicted structures this feature could not be shared by other tcps.
the stoichiometry of the tape measure protein is also discussed."
"deciphering the sources of variability in drug responses requires to understand the processes modulating drug pharmacokinetics.
however pharmacological research suffers from poor reproducibility across clinical animal and experimental models.
predictivity can be improved by using organsonchips which are more physiological humanoriented microengineered devices that include microfluidics.
ooc are particularly relevant at the fundamental and preclinical stages of drug development by providing more accurate assessment of key pharmacokinetic events.
we have developed a proximal tubuleonachip model combining commercial microfluidic and chip technologies.
using the rptectert1 cell line we set up a dualflow system with antiparallel flows to mimic the dynamics of blood and urine.
we assessed transporters mrna expression using rtqpcr cellular polarization and protein expression via immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy and monitored the transcellular transport of a list of prototypic xenobiotics by determining their efflux ratios with lcmsms.
our results show that flow exposure significantly modulate mrna expression of drug membrane transporters compared to static conditions.
dynamic conditions also enhance cell polarization as evidenced by preferential basal and apical expressions of nakatpase pgp oct2 and mate1  as well as the cellular secretory profile.
we demonstrated unidirectional transcellular transport of a cationic substrate metformin with a higher efflux than influx ratio inhibited with a specific oct2 inhibitor thus confirming the relevance of our proximal tubuleonachip set up for cation transport investigations.
our proximal tubuleonachip can also be used to explore the interactions between transporters xenobiotics and endogenous metabolites possibly involved in the variability of individual drug responses.
this study provides additional evidence that ooc can bridge the gaps between systemic and local pharmacokinetics i.e.
drug concentration close to its target at the fundamental and preclinical stages."
"motivated by the recent putative reproducibility crisis we discuss the relationship between replicability of scientific studies reproducibility of results obtained in these replications and the philosophy of statistics.
our approach focuses on challenges in specifying scientific studies for scientific inference via statistical inference and is complementary to classical discussions in philosophy of statistics.
we particularly consider the challenges in replicating studies exactly using the notion of the idealized experiment.
we argue against treating reproducibility as an inherently desirable property of scientific results and in favor of viewing it as a tool to measure distance between an original study and its replications.
to sensibly study the implications of replicability and results reproducibility on inference such a measure of replication distance is needed.
we present an effort to delineate such a framework here addressing some challenges in capturing the components of scientific studies while identifying others as ongoing issues.
we illustrate our measure of replication distance by simulations using a toy example.
rather than replications we present purposefully planned modifications as an appropriate tool to inform scientific inquiry.
our ability to measure replication distance serves scientists in their search for replicationready studies.
we believe that likelihoodbased and evidential approaches may play a critical role towards building a statistics that effectively serves the practical needs of science."
"the flora and fauna of island systems especially those in the indopacific are renowned for their high diversification rates and outsized contribution to the development of evolutionary theories.
the total diversity of geographic radiations of many indopacific fauna is often incompletely sampled in phylogenetic studies due to the difficulty in obtaining single island endemic forms across the pacific and the relatively poor performance of degraded dna when using museum specimens for inference of evolutionary relationships.
new methods for production and analysis of genomewide datasets sourced from degraded dna are facilitating insights into the complex evolutionary histories of these influential island faunas.

"glioblastoma gbm is the most lethal primary brain neoplasm due to its highly immunosuppressive microenvironment and resistance to conventional therapies.
to overcome this challenge we engineered a replicating retrovirus rrv to deliver a superagonist interleukin15 receptorlinker fusion protein rli directly to tumor cells engineering them into local immunotherapy biofactories.
this strategy leverages the tumorselective replication of rrv to achieve localized and sustained rli expression within the tumor microenvironment.
in two orthotopic poorly immunogenic gbm mouse models intratumoral administration of rrv rli significantly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival compared to controls with some mice achieving longterm remission and demonstrating immunological memory upon rechallenge.
transcriptomic and flow cytometric analyses revealed that rrv rli treatment enhanced infiltration and activation of cd8⁺ t cells and nk cells and upregulated antigen presentation pathways within the tumor microenvironment.
depletion studies indicated that the therapeutic efficacy of rrv rli is dependent on both cd4⁺ and cd8⁺ t cells.
notably combining rrv rli with the gbm standard of care chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide synergistically improved survival outcomes.
subsequent singlecell rna and tcell receptor sequencing identified enhanced effector cell activation antigen presentation and clonal tcell expansion in the combination therapy group.
our findings suggest that rrvmediated delivery of rli effectively transforms gbm tumors into immunostimulatory hubs eliciting potent antitumor immune responses.
this novel viral immunotherapy holds significant promise for clinical translation in the treatment of gbm and other difficulttotreat solid tumors."
"repetitive sequences are a common feature of bacterial genomes.
some repetitive sequences such as repins are mobile within the genome but inherited only vertically from mother to daughter across bacterial genomes.
selfish elements in contrast are mobile within the genome but also travel horizontally from genome to genome.
yet no matter the nature of the association between the repetitive elements and the host it is difficult to study the evolutionary dynamics of repetitive sequences across genomes.
if it is unclear whether two sequences in two different genomes are in orthologous positions it is difficult to infer parameters like the replication rate horizontal transfer rate and rate of loss.
here we present a tool to facilitate these analyses called reporth.
reporth determines whether repetitive sequences in different but closely related bacterial genomes occur in orthologous genomic positions.
whether a position is orthologous or not depends on the orthology of flanking sequences.
flanking sequences are deemed orthologous if they are bidirectional best hits.
all repetitive sequences that are found in orthologous positions across different genomes are grouped together.
analyses of these groups can be used to study the evolutionary dynamics of selfish repetitive elements such as insertion sequences but also for mutualistic repetitive elements such as repins."
"cardiovascular disease and heart failure are a major health challenge with sex differences in pathophysiology and treatment responses critically influencing patient outcomes.
g proteincoupled receptor gpcr kinase 2 grk2 is a pivotal regulator of cellular signaling whose elevation is a hallmark of heart failure progression.
its complex network of protein interactions impact a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological processes including cardiac function.
in this study we examined the effects of cardiacrestricted expression of an aminoterminal peptide of grk2 βarknt in female mice subjected to acute and chronic pressure overload.
our findings reveal that that βarknt affects hypertrophy development and cardiac function differently in female mice than in males leading to a transition to heart failure not observed in control females or βarknt males.
notably the βarknt female mice exhibited baseline hypertrophy with distinct left atrial morphology increased fibrosis and immune cell infiltration compared to the controls which progressed under chronic stress indicating adverse cardiac remodeling.
furthermore βarknt female mice unlike males exhibit impaired tissue respiration following acute pressure overload and altered glucose sensitivity and insulin tolerance highlighting significant remodeling of cardiac and systemic metabolism."

"studies on collective cognition have provided many examples of decisionmaking benefits in terms of animals sharing information about predators prey or resources in their environment.
it has been shown how the efficient spread of adaptive information within groups can provide benefits which increase with group size.
little is known however to which extent groups also amplify maladaptive information such as false alarms and whether such costs reduce or even nullify the above benefits.
here we investigated fish shoals in the wild that responded collectively with escape dives when attacked by birds.
we analysed the response of shoals in reaction to hardtodetect bird attacks and similar but harmless flybys as a function of shoal size.
with increasing shoal size fish increasingly detected predator attacks true positives while their false alarms remained constant.
therefore larger shoals became better at correctly classifying potentially dangerous stimuli rather than becoming more sensitive to all stimuli potentially related to attacks.
in addition decision time decreased with increasing shoal size.
larger shoals were thus able to mitigate two major tradeoffs inherent in solitary decision making the tradeoff between true and false positives and the tradeoff between speed and accuracy.
we report performance increases at shoal sizes of tens of thousands of fish and pose challenges for the modelling of the underlying mechanisms."

"natural selection shapes how individuals learn and acquire knowledge from their environment.
under the right conditions this can lead to the evolution of learning scheduleshow individuals allocate resources to acquire knowledge throughout their lifespanthat promote the accumulation of knowledge across generations cumulative knowledge or cumulative culture.
in spite of having been observed across multiple taxa the role of parental teaching in this evolutionary process remains understudied.
using mathematical modelling we show that learning schedules and parental teaching coevolve resulting in greater time spent learning individually and innovating as well as greater intergenerational transfer of knowledge from parent to offspring.
these outcomes together enhance cumulative knowledge.
our analyses further reveal that within populations selection typically favours an association between teaching and individual learning leading to a  syndrome whereby some individuals innovate and teach within the family knowledge producers with extensive knowledge while others teach less and learn socially outside of the family knowledge scroungers with less knowledge.
overall our findings indicate that the coevolution of learning schedules and teaching promotes knowledge accumulation within and between generations and favors diversity  within and between populations in knowledge acquisition possession and transmission."
"background exercising with low muscle glycogen content can improve training adaptation but the mechanisms underlying the muscular adaptation are still largely unknown.
in this study we measured substrate utilization and cell signaling in different muscle fiber types during exercise and investigated a possible link between these variables.
methods five subjects performed a single leg cycling exercise in the evening day 1 with the purpose of reducing glycogen stores.
the following morning day 2 they performed twolegged cycling at 70 of vo for 1h.
muscle biopsies were taken from both legs pre and postexercise for enzymatic analyses of glycogen metabolite concentrations using lcmsmsbased quantification and protein signaling using western blot in pools of type i or type ii fibers.
results glycogen content was 6065 lower for both fiber types p0.01 in the leg that exercised on day 1 low leg compared to the other leg with normal level of glycogen normal leg before the cycling exercise on day 2. glycogen utilization during exercise was significantly less in both fiber types in the low compared to the normal leg p0.05.
in the low leg there was a 14 and 6fold increase in longchain fatty acids conjugated to carnitine in type i and type ii fibers respectively postexercise.
this increase was 34 times larger than in the normal leg p0.05.
postexercise mtor phosphorylation was increased in both fiber types in the normal leg p0.05 but remained unchanged in both fiber types in the low leg together with an increase in eef2 phosphorylation in type i fibers p0.01.
exercise induced a reduction in the autophagy marker lc3bii in both fiber types and legs but the postexercise level was higher in both fiber types in the low leg p0.05.
accordingly the lc3biii ratio decreased only in the normal leg 75 for type i and 87 for type ii p0.01.
conclusions starting an endurance exercise session with low glycogen availability leads to profound changes in substrate utilization in both type i and type ii fibers.
this may reduce the mtorc1 signaling response primarily in type i muscle fibers and attenuate the normally observed reduction in autophagy."
"salvia species native to the americas are rich in valuable bioactive furanoclerodanes like the psychoactive salvinorin a found in salvia divinorum which is used in treatment of opioid addiction.
however there is relatively little known about their biosynthesis.
to address this we investigated the biosynthesis of salviarin the simplest furanoclerodane structure in the ornamental sage salvia splendens.
using a selforganizing map and mutual rank analysis of rnaseq coexpression data we identified three cytochrome p450 enzymes responsible for converting kolavenol into salviarin precursors consecutively annonene hardwickiic acid and hautriwaic acid.
as annonene and hardwickiic acid have also been proposed as intermediates in the biosynthesis of salvinorin a and to examine our hypothesis for common evolutionary origin of the furanoclerodane pathway between the two salvia species we searched for homologous genes in available data for s. divinorum.
the enzymes encoded by orthologous genes from s. divinorum displayed kolavenol synthase sdkls annonene synthase sdans and hardwickiic acid synthase sdhdas activity respectively supporting the view that these are intermediate steps in the biosynthesis of salvinorin a. we investigated the origin of annonene synthase and the role of gene duplication in the evolution of this specific activity.
our work shows how s. splendens can serve as a model species for studying furanoclerodanes biosynthesis in salvia species contributes to understanding the evolution of specialized metabolism in plants and provides new tools to produce salvinorin a in biotechnological chassis."
"a hallmark of αsynucleinopathies e.g.
parkinson disease is the misfolding and aggregation of αsynuclein in tissues and biological fluids.
protein amplification assays like realtime quakinginduced conversion rtquic are sensitive yet currently limited to semiinvasive sample types such as cerebrospinal fluid because more accessible samples such as blood contain inhibitors.
here we show that nanoparticleenhanced quakinginduced conversion nanoquic can double the speed of reactions spiked with misfolded αsynuclein while increasing sensitivity 100fold in human plasma.
nanoquic detected spike concentrations down to 90 pgml in lysed whole blood while reactions without nanoparticles rtquic failed to have any detection due to the presence of strong inhibitors.
moreover nanoquic showed increased seeding activity in plasma samples from parkinson disease patients n4 versus healthy controls n4.
this sets the groundwork for the noninvasive diagnostic use of nanoquic potentially enabling early disease detection and management through bloodbased testing."

"many eukaryotic species undergo sexual reproduction facultatively either in response to stress or in particular environments.
for the remainder of their life cycle they reproduce by mitosis.
this facultative sex may be rare which alters features of their evolutionary dynamics.
both the frequency of sex and the degree of inbreeding have been challenging to estimate from genomescale polymorphism data.
here we describe a method to estimate both these parameters based on a diploid moran model with heterozygous sites.
we apply this method to population genomic data from  parasitic protozoans from the  species complex showing that these parasites undergo sexual reproduction approximately once per 10000 generations and that populations vary considerably in the extent of their inbreeding."
"rna viruses play an important role in regulating their host and global biogeochemical cycling and auxiliary metabolic genes amgs are one of the main pathways by which viruses regulate hosts metabolism.
however the amgs encoded by global rna viruses are largely unexplored.
here we annotated rna viral genomes and identified amgs from recently published global rna virome datasets.
we found 274 amgs encoded by 243 rna viral genomes which accounts for only 0.008 of all 3216257 genomes investigated.
these amgs span 25 functional categories the most prevalent being translation energy metabolism membrane transport transcription replication and repair and signal transduction.
unlike dna viruses rna viruses tend to encode amgs influencing the genetic and environments information processing of their hosts with fewer amgs linked to nutrient cycling such as carbon and nitrogen metabolism.
in addition rna viruses encoding these amgs were taxonomically diverse spanning five established phyla the newly proposed phylum taraviricota and fourteen lucaprot supergroups.
host prediction indicated that most of these rna viruses encoding amgs infect eukaryotes while only a few of them including  and  infect prokaryotes.
interestingly the potential host phylum for most of these rna viruses were different from the likely source phylum of their amgs suggesting the possibility that these rna viruses acquired amgs from organisms outside their predicted host range.
this study provides the first comprehensive analysis of amgs from global rna virome which greatly expands our understanding of their function roles evolutionary history and virushost interactions."

"endosymbiotic reproductive manipulators are widely studied as sources of postzygotic isolation in arthropods but their effect on prezygotic isolation between genetically differentiated populations has garnered less attention.
we tested this using two partially isolated populations of the red and green colour forms of  either uninfected or infected with different  strains one inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility and the other not.
we first investigated male and female preferences and found that in absence of infection females were not choosy but all males preferred redform females.
effects were more subtle with only the ciinducing strain slightly strengthening colourform based preferences.
we then performed a doublemating experiment to test how incompatible matings affect subsequent mating behaviour and offspring production as compared to compatible matings.
females mated with an incompatible male infected andor heterotypic were more attractive andor receptive to subsequent compatible matings although analyses of offspring production revealed no clear benefit for this remating behaviour i.e.
apparently unaltered first male sperm precedence.
finally by computing the relative contributions of each reproductive barrier to total isolation we showed that premating isolation matches both hostassociated and induced postmating isolation suggesting that  could contribute to reproductive isolation in this system."
"anion exchanger 1 ae1 is an elevatortype membrane transporter that plays a key role in erythrocytes by mediating exchange of chloride and bicarbonate ions across the membrane thus participating in acidbase homeostasis.
while previous studies have provided structural insights into ae1 and its substrate binding the conformational transitions and role of lipid interactions have remained elusive.
in this study we utilized cryoelectron microscopy cryoem to resolve three high resolution structure of distinct conformational states of ae1 two inwardfacing if1 and if2 and one outwardfacing of.
furthermore uptake assay revealed the modulatory effect of phosphatidylinositol 45bisphosphate pip lipids on ae1.
molecular dynamics md simulations were conducted on these structures to capture anion binding and determine the anion binding sites in ae1.
we then used a combination of advanced enhanced sampling techniques together with systemspecific collective variables to study the of⇐⇒if transition in ae1 and provide refined pathways for the process in three different systems apo hcobound and an ae1 system in which cryoem determined interfacial pip lipids had been removed.
these pathways were then used to calculate the free energy of the of⇐⇒if transition in ae1 under different conditions.
the energies show how substrate binding reduces the energy barrier and therefore facilitates the transport.
furthermore they clearly capture the inhibitory effect of pip lipids at the dimer interface and provide a molecular mechanism for it.
these results provide molecularlevel understanding of the mechanistic basis for ion transport in ae1 and the regulatory role of pip"

"our paper is the first contribution to the comprehensive analysis of the complicated evolution of cranial and mandibular parts connected by pterygoid muscles as part of more global investigation into adaptive evolution of arvicolinae.
the analysis was performed on 90 microcomputedtomography–scanned specimens from 33 species from 19 genera of arvicolinae as well as two species from two genera of cricetinae as an outgroup.
we revised 11 morphological traits of the “palatosphenopterygoid” complex including key features of the palatine that are highly important for defining arvicolinae taxa according to the microcomputedtomography data.
we also homologized characters of the posterior palatal margin and categorized the composition of the palatal elements into two main morphotypes morphotype “a” is unique to clethrionomyini and morphotype “b” was subdivided into three additional types and was found to occur in the outgroup cricetines voles b2 and lemmings b3.
morphospace analysis of the palatosphenopterygoid complex by means of the threedimensional dataset revealed a mode of transformation of morphotype “a” into morphotype “b2.” a separate task was the development of a protocol for the preparation of morphological data for subsequent evaluation of genotype–phenotype relationships using specialized software applications e.g.

"epicuticular wax blooms are associated with improved drought resistance in many species including sorghum bicolor.
while the role of wax in drought resistance is well known we report new insights into how light and drought dynamically influence wax production.
we investigated how wax quantity and composition are modulated over time and in response to different environmental stressors as well as the molecular and genetic mechanisms involved in such.
gas chromatographymass spectrometry and photographic results showed that sorghum leaf sheath wax load and composition were altered in mature plants grown under drought and simulated shade though this phenomenon appears to vary by sorghum cultivar.
we combined an in vitro wax induction protocol with gcms and rnaseq measurements to identify a draft signaling pathway for wax bloom induction in sorghum.
we also explored the potential of spectrophotometry to aid in monitoring wax bloom dynamics.
spectrophotometric analysis showed primary differences in reflectance between bloomrich and bloomless tissue surfaces in the 230500nm range of the spectrum corresponding to the blue color channel of photographic data.
our smartphonebased system detected significant differences in wax production between control and shade treatment groups demonstrating its potential for candidate screening.
overall our data suggest that wax extrusion can be rapidly modulated in response to light occurring within days compared to the months required for the changes observed under greenhouse droughtsimulated shade conditions.
these results highlight the dynamic nature of wax modulation in response to varying environmental stimuli especially light and water availability."

"sirna therapeutics have considerable potential as molecularlytargeted therapeutics in malignant disease but identification of effective delivery strategies that mediate rapid intracellular delivery while minimizing toxicity has been challenging.
our group recently developed and optimized an sirna conjugate platform termed sirnal2 which harnesses noncovalent association with endogenous circulating albumin to extend circulation halflife and achieve tumorselective delivery without the use of traditional cationic lipids or polymers for transfection.
to improve intracellular delivery and particularly the endosomal escape properties of sirnal2 towards more efficient gene silencing we report synthesis of sirnacql2 conjugates in which chloroquine cq an endosomolytic quinoline alkaloid is covalently incorporated into the branching lipid tail structure.
we accomplished this via synthesis of a novel cq phosphoramidite which can be incorporated into a modular sirnal2 backbone using oncolumn solidphase synthesis through use of asymmetric branchers with levulinylprotected hydroxide groups that allow covalent addition of pendant cq repeats.
we demonstrate that sirnacql2 maintains the ability to noncovalently bind albumin and with multiple copies of cq sirnacql2 mediates higher endosomal disruption cellular uptakeretention and reporter gene knockdown in cancer cells.
further in mice the addition of cq did not significantly affect circulation kinetics nor organ biodistribution and did not produce hematologic or organlevel toxicity.
thus controlled multivalent conjugation of albuminbinding sirnal2 to endosomolytic small molecule compounds holds promise in improving sirnal2 knockdown potency while maintaining albuminbinding properties and overall safety."
"radiotherapy is one of the main therapeutic options for the treatment of lung cancer.
although highly efficient radiation cause severe damages to normal tissue and radioinduced toxicities vary from mild pneumonitis to pulmonary fibrosis.

treated with radiation and compared the transcriptional profiles of the distinct lung populations from the same patient removed at distance from the tumor i.e.
nontreated with radiation.
analysis of six lung samples from patients suffering from pancoast tumor a rare lung malignancy that requires neoadjuvant radiotherapy before surgery revealed a strong induction of vegf signaling after radiotherapy.
expression of vegfa one of the canonical proangiogenic ligands was found upregulated in multiple cell populations in lung exposed to high doses of radiation.
irradiated capillaries particularly gcap cells expressing kdrvegfr2 present transcriptional profile similar to tip cells characterized by sprouting and motility capacities.
in addition we identified a subpopulation of alveolar macrophages expressing flt1vegfr1 a receptor for vegfa in lung tissues treated by radiotherapy.
cellcell communication analysis revealed that flt1vegfr1 positive macrophages interact with tip cells after radiotherapy through il1bil1r signaling.
lastly analysis of mouse single cell dataset confirmed the increase in the proportion of gcap cells presenting a tiplike phenotype after radiation injury.
altogether this study describes at the single cell level the proangiogenic responses of human lung after radiotherapy.

"tropical coral reefs are undergoing unprecedented degradation primarily due to the increasing intensity and frequency of marine heatwaves with climate change.
coral bleaching is a well–known ramification of marine heatwaves but rapid coral mortality is an emerging paradigm that visually manifests as the ′sloughing′ of tissue from the coral skeleton.
unlike coral bleaching coral tissue sloughing precludes any prospect of holobiont recovery beyond the initial onset indicating a life–or–death tipping point.
here we experimentally confirm this phenomenon occurs when temperatures increase within temporal windows of hours to days consistent with field observations.
through microscale measurements of dissolved oxygen in the diffusive boundary layers of two abundant keystone reef–building corals we demonstrate that rapid temperature increases coincide with intrinsic oxygen deprivation occurring before gross tissue disintegration or coral tissue sloughing.
we propose that this distinct phenomenon arises from rapid heating rendering the coral holobiont incapable of engaging in reactive processes to counteract the combined effects of heightened aerobic demands and impaired photosynthetic function.
the passive diffusion of o from the surrounding bulk water is likely insufficient to meet the holobionts requirements as explained by the einstein–smoluchowski kinetic theory of gases and brownian motion.
these insights into coral tissue sloughing underscore the complexity of holobiont responses to stress and biophysical consequences of heatwaves.
a granular understanding of these mechanisms is urgently needed particularly regarding how heating rates may change under future climate scenarios to reevaluate the potentially under–recognised threats facing coral reefs."

"in proteobacteria the outer membrane protein tama and the inner membraneanchored protein tamb form the translocation and assembly module tam complex which facilitates the transport of autotransporters virulence factors and likely lipids across the two membranes.
in bacteroidetes tama is replaced by taml a tamalike lipoprotein with a lipid modification at its nterminus that likely anchors it to the outer membrane.
this structural difference suggests that taml may have a distinct function compared to tama.
however the role of tam in bacterial phyla other than proteobacteria remains unexplored.
our study aimed to elucidate the functional importance of taml in flavobacterium johnsoniae an environmental bacteroidetes.
unlike its homologues in proteobacteria we found that taml and tamb are essential in f. johnsoniae.
through genetic phenotypic proteomic and lipidomic analyses we discovered that taml depletion severely compromises outer membrane integrity as evidenced by reduced cell viability altered cell shape increased susceptibility to membranedisrupting agents and elevated levels of outer membrane lipoproteins.
notably we did not observe any impact on outer membrane lipid composition.
via pulldown protein assays we confirmed that taml interacts with tamb in f. johnsoniae likely forming the tam complex.
furthermore our in silico analysis revealed that the presence of taml and tamb monocistronic genes is a shared genetic feature among bacteroidetes members including the human pathogen capnocytophaga canimorsus where we also confirmed the essentiality of the taml and tamb homologs.

"carbon sequestration by trees is crucial to mitigate the effects of the current climate crisis.
the extent to trees sequester and allocate carbon to above or belowground structures in turn is mediated by neighbouring species.
although many studies have demonstrated positive effects of diverse neighbourhoods on a trees productivity little is known about biomass allocation responses to mono vs. heterospecific neighbourhoods.
in the present study we quantified above and belowground biomass production and roottoshoot ratios rsr of trees grown in mono and heterospecific neighbourhoods.
to this end we analysed growth of mono and heterospecific tree species pairs tsps established in a greenhouse and a field experiment.
in the greenhouse experiment response variables were measured after one year of growth after sapling harvest.
in the field experiment conducted in the context of a forest biodiversity experiment in subtropical china we analysed biomass density and rsr over three years using terrestrial laser scanner and minirhizotrons.
rsr of trees in heterospecific tsps were significantly higher than in monospecific tsps.
in the greenhouse experiment this was related to a stronger below than aboveground overyielding in heterospecific tsps.
in the field experiment trees in heterospecific tsps showed a stronger increase in aboveground investments over time than in monospecific tsps indicating that positive diversity effects became stronger for aboveground structures with progressing tree development.
our findings are consistent with the optimal biomass partitioning theory and highlight the importance of treetree interactions on biomass allocation.
higher rsr in mixtures further suggest a higher resistance or resilience of tree saplings against environmental stressors related to climate change drought heat waves."
"the evolution of sexual secondary characteristics necessitates regulatory factors that confer sexual identity to differentiating tissues and cells.
in  butterflies males exhibit two specialized wing scale types — uviridescent uvi and lanceolate scales — absent in females and likely integral to male courtship behavior.
this study investigates the regulatory mechanisms and singlenucleus transcriptomics underlying these two sexually dimorphic cell types during wing development.
we show that doublesex dsx expression is itself dimorphic and required to repress the uvi cell state in females while unexpectedly uvi activation in males is independent from dsx.
in the melanic marginal band dsx is required in each sex to enforce the presence of lanceolate scales in males and their absence in females.

"accurate forecasts of the biological impacts of climate change require a better understanding of how smallscale temperature variability affects individual physiology and population dynamics.
but doing so for intertidal species with large distribution ranges while also accounting for the effect of local adaptation presents numerous technical challenges.
here we assessed the macroecological consequences of thermal stress on the coldadapted brown seaweed ascophyllum nodosum across its european distribution.
we collected specimens from ten populations spanning latitudes 41n to 60n and subjected them to simulated intertidal heat stress using a novel custombuilt experimental setup that replicated realistic conditions including tidal cycles light conditions and temperature trajectories based on in situ data.
our factorial design comprised eight experimental treatments combining two hightide water temperatures 15 c and 20.5 c with four lowtide peak temperatures 28.5 c to 40.5 c. physiological performance was evaluated through measurements of growth mortality and oxygen production.
results indicate that thermal stress is more closely associated with the magnitude of temperature change between high and low tides rather than the absolute maximum temperatures reached.
algae exposed to warmer water temperatures 20.5 c consistently outperformed those in colder water 15 c suggesting that cold upwelled waters at the species southern limit may not be essential for survival.
southern populations demonstrated higher resilience to thermal stress than central and northern counterparts.
integrating these physiological responses with climate projections we employed demographic models to forecast longterm population dynamics.
the models predict that future climatic conditions could exceed the thermal resilience of specific populations leading to uneven impacts across the european distribution of the species.
notwithstanding range contractions may occur at the warm edge of the distribution where populations though more resilient to thermal stress could still be overwhelmed by the pace of warming.
this study underscores the importance of realistic experimental simulations in evaluating species thermal tolerance and highlights the potential for climate change to differentially impact populations along large latitudinal gradients."

the omentum is a privileged metastatic site and the metabolic exchange underlying omental metastasis could provide enzyme or receptor targets to block spread.
in this study we adapted a mass spectrometry imaging msi protocol to investigate spatial location of 3d cocultures of tumorigenic fte cells when grown in proximity to murine omental explants as a model of early metastatic colonization.
our analysis revealed several altered metabolites in tumorigenic fteomentum cocultures namely changes in branchedchain amino acids bcaa including valine.
we quantified the heightened consumption of valine other bcaas and other amino acidderived metabolites in omental cocultures using lcms assays.
our analysis revealed that metabolite concentrations when monitored with msi from cell culture media in living culture systems have notable considerations for how msi data may produce signatures that induce ionization suppression.
supplementation with valine enhanced proliferation and mtor signaling in tumorigenic fte cells suggesting the potential of bcaas as a nutrient utilized by tumor cells during omental colonization and a possible target for metastasis."

"genetic variants associated with autoimmune diseases are highly enriched within putative regulatory regions of cd4 t cells suggesting that they alter disease risk via changes in gene regulation.
however very few genetic variants have been shown to affect t cell gene expression or function.
we tested 18000 autoimmune diseaseassociated variants for allelespecific expression using massively parallel reporter assays in primary human cd4 t cells.
the 545 expressionmodulating variants emvars identified greatly enrich for likely causal variants.
we provide evidence that many emvars are mediated by common upstream regulatory conduits and that putative target genes of primary t cell emvars are highly enriched within a lymphocyte activation network.
using bulk and singlecell crisprinterference screens we confirm that emvarcontaining t cell regulatory elements modulate both known and novel target genes that regulate t cell proliferation providing plausible mechanisms by which these variants alter autoimmune disease risk."
"tumors often evolve to engage numerous strategies to circumvent detection by the immune system.
our group recently discovered elevated neolactoseries glycosphingolipids nsgsl surface levels as a possible immune evasion mechanism of tumors.
we demonstrated a direct disruption of both innate and adaptive antitumor immunity in vitro when expression of nsgsls was upregulated on established target cells.
it remains unclear however whether in vivo nsgsls play an active role in tumor development and can aid tumors in evading immune responses.
to investigate whether nsgsls facilitate tumor progression in vivo we first established a murine model system using mc38ova cell lines with varying cell surface levels of nsgsls.
in vitro analysis revealed reduced mhci accessibility on tumor cells with elevated nsgsls profiles leading to diminished activation of ovaspecific oti t cells as evidenced by decreased expression of cd25 cd69 and production of ifng which subsequently resulted in decreased tumor cell death.
subsequent in vivo experiments investigating tumor outgrowth after engraftment of subcutaneously injected mc38ova cell lines with low or high cell surface levels of nsgsls demonstrated better growth of nsgslrich tumor cells compared to nsgslpoor tumors which could be controlled.
together these results suggest that nsgsls expressed by tumors can facilitate immune evasion and subsequent tumor progression.
these data pave the way to explore whether targeting of the gsl pathway with specific inhibitors could be advantageous as a therapy against tumors with high nsgsl levels."
"traitbased ecology considerably increased our comprehension of various fields related to ecology and evolution.
as measuring traits can be timeconsuming and costly analyses regularly gather trait data from databases instead of carrying out new measurements.
however intraspecific trait variability can cause considerable differences between the trait values of different population and regions.
here we evaluated whether intraspecific trait variability causes considerable differences in trait values measured in two different regions of europe.
we tested whether regionally measured trait data from the pannonian ecoregion differ from trait data of the same species originating from northwestern europe by comparing data from the pannonian database of plant traits padapt and the leda traitbase.
we evaluated six traits of the same set of species thousandseed mass tsm seed bank persistence index sbpi leaf area la leaf dry matter content ldmc specific leaf area sla and leaf dry mass.
we found that trait data from the two databases significantly differed for tsm sbpi sla and ldmc.
our results indicate that the markedly different climate of the two regions can cause substantial intraspecific trait variation therefore the geographical origin of trait data matters in traitbased analyses.
the findings corroborate the assumption that regionally measured trait data and building regional databases are essential for reliable regionalscale traitbased studies.
we conclude that for studies analysing traits in the pannonian ecoregion and possibly in easter and central europe in general it is advisable to use padapt instead of databases compiling data from regions with markedly different climatic conditions."
"biological systems are fundamentally containers of thermally fluctuating atoms that through unknown mechanisms are structurally layered across many thermal scales from atoms to amino acids to primary secondary and tertiary structures to functional proteins to functional macromolecular assemblies and up.
understanding how chemical thermodynamics sc ales across these layered structures is central to describing biological structure and function.
muscle – with chemical thermodynamics welldefined on two different thermal scales – provides a clear solution to this problem.
in 1938 a.v.
hill made the extraordinary observation that the mechanics and chemistry of muscle contraction is defined independent of the structural components of muscle implying that the mechanics and chemistry of myosin motor proteins within muscle do not classically scale up to muscle.
we have demonstrated experimentally that thermal scaling bridges hill’s topdown thermodynamics and the bottomup philosophy of molecular biologists.

"salt stress significantly limits cotton growth and development making the improvement of salt tolerance critical.
cmf genes containing a single cct domain are promising targets for breeding programs.
we identified 101 cmf genes from four cotton species.
phylogenetic analysis grouped these genes into six clusters closely related to arabidopsis.
gene structure and motif analysis showed high conservation while collinear analysis indicated segmental duplication as a key factor in cmf gene family expansion.
promoter analysis predicted involvement in light abiotic stress plant hormone responses and growth.
expression analysis revealed differential expression of ghcmf genes across tissues with some induced by abiotic stress.
coexpression network analysis indicated ghcmf14 interacts with other proteins to resist abiotic stress.
subcellular localization showed ghcmf14 in the nucleus.
silencing ghcmf14 enhanced salt tolerance with higher chlorophyll and proline content and lower mda and h2o2 levels.
this study provides insights into cmf gene regulation and their role in cotton salt stress tolerance."
"here we systematically studied the reproducibility of degs in previously published alzheimers disease ad parkinsons disease pd and covid19 scrnaseq studies.
we found that while transcriptional scores created from differentially expressed genes degs in individual pd and covid19 datasets had moderate predictive power for the case control status of other datasets mean auc0.77 and 0.75 respectively genes from individual ad datasets had poor predictive power mean auc0.68.
we developed a nonparametric metaanalysis method sumrank based on reproducibility of relative differential expression ranks across datasets.
the metaanalysis genes had improved predictive power aucs of 0.88 0.91 and 0.78 respectively.
by multiple other metrics specificity and sensitivity of these genes were substantially higher than those discovered by dataset merging and inverse variance weighted pvalue aggregation methods.
the degs revealed known and novel biological pathways and we validate the bcat1 gene as downregulated in oligodendrocytes in an ad mouse model.
our analyses show that for heterogeneous diseases degs of individual studies often have low reproducibility but combining information across multiple datasets promotes the rigorous discovery of reproducible degs."

in the human spinal cord expansion of the motor neuron lineage is achieved through a newly evolved progenitor domain called vpmn ventral motor neuron progenitor that uniquely extends and expands motor neurogenesis.
this behavior of vpmns is controlled by transcription factor nkx22 which in vpmns is coexpressed with classical motor neuron progenitor pmn marker olig2.

"stomatal anatomy and physiology define co availability for photosynthesis and regulate plant water use.
despite being key drivers of yield and dynamic responsiveness to abiotic stresses conventional measurement techniques of stomatal traits are laborious and slow limiting adoption in plant breeding.
advances in instrumentation and data analyses present an opportunity to screen stomatal traits at scales relevant to plant breeding.
we present a highthroughput fieldbased phenotyping approach fielddino for screening of stomatal physiology and anatomy.
the method allows coupled measurements to be collected in 15 s and consists of 1 stomatal conductance measurements using a handheld porometer 2  collection of epidermal images with a digital microscope 3dprinted leaf clip and pythonbased app and 3 automated deep learning analysis of stomatal features.
the yolov8m model trained on images collected in the field achieved strong performance metrics with an map0.5 of 97.1 for stomatal detection.
validation in large field trials of 200 wheat genotypes with two irrigation treatments captured wide diversity in stomatal traits.
fielddino enables stomatal data collection and analysis at unprecedented scales in the field.
this will advance research on stomatal biology and accelerate the incorporation of stomatal traits into plant breeding programs for resilience to abiotic stress."
"spillover of infectious diseases is a significant issue for human animal and plant health in part due to their potential to host jump.
current approaches to predict and prevent host jumps are structured around discovering new viruses drawing associations between pathogen characteristics and host jump risk and managing spillover but prediction and prevention are still elusive.
spillover is a critical step in the process of completing a host jump so it is often assumed that a pathogens spillover rate is predictive of host jump risk.
however this may not necessarily be the case.
while a pathogen that spills over into a novel host frequently will indeed have many opportunities to establish itself the lack of success establishing itself in previous spillovers demonstrates a poor ability to do so.
in comparison a pathogen that rarely spills over will have few opportunities to establish itself but may be well suited to do so and could in theory be more likely to host jump despite these limited opportunities.
here we address the question of which of these poses the greater risk.
using a bayesian framework we create a model to quantify the probability that a host jump occurs in some future time interval.
this model only depends on the number of spillover events in the past and future and our uncertainty regarding the probability that a single spillover will result in a host jump.
we derive an analytical solution to this model which shows that when past and future spillover rates are linearly correlated a pathogens inherent rate of spillover is a poor predictor of host jump risk owing to two complementary factors.
first the pathogens that pose the greatest host jump risk may be either those that spillover extremely rarely or extremely commonly with the result depending on our prior uncertainly in the probability that a spillover will result in a host jump.
second as spillover rate becomes large the increase in the number of opportunities for a host jump to occur conferred by the increase in the number of spillover events is exactly balanced by a decrease in the probability of success for each individual spillover event.
therefore we show that spillover rate is not a useful metric for evaluating host jump risk."
"carboxysomes are polyhedral protein organelles that microorganisms use to facilitate carbon dioxide assimilation.
they are composed of a modular protein shell which envelops an enzymatic core mainly comprised of physically coupled rubisco and carbonic anhydrase.
while the modular construction principles of carboxysomes make them attractive targets as customizable metabolic platforms their size and complexity can be a hinderance.
in this work we design and validate a plasmid set – the pxpressome toolkit in which αcarboxysomes are robustly expressed and remain intact and functional after purification.
we tested this toolkit by introducing mutations which influence carboxysome structure and performance.
we find that deletion of vertexcapping genes results in formation of larger carboxysomes while deletion of facet forming genes produces smaller particles suggesting that adjusting the ratio of these proteins can rationally affect morphology.
through a series of fluorescently labeled constructs we observe this toolkit leads to more uniform expression and better cell health than previously published carboxysome expression systems.
overall the pxpressome toolkit facilitates the study and redesign of carboxysomes with robust performance and improved phenotype uniformity.
the pxpressome toolkit will support efforts to remodel carboxysomes for enhanced carbon fixation or serve as a platform for other nanoencapsulation goals."
"the use of social contact rates is widespread in infectious disease modeling since it has been shown that they are key driving forces of important epidemiological parameters.
quantification of contact patterns is crucial to parametrize dynamic transmission models and to provide insights on the basic reproduction number.
information on social interactions can for instance be obtained from populationbased contact surveys such as the european commission project polymod.
estimation of agespecific contact rates from these studies is often done using a piecewise constant approach or bivariate smoothing techniques.
for the latter typically smoothing is done in the dimensions of the respondent’s and contact’s age.
we propose a new flexible strategy based on a smoothing constrained approach  taking into account the reciprocal nature of contacts  where the contact rates are assumed smooth from a cohort perspective as well as from the age distribution of contacts.
this is achieved by smoothing over the diagonal components including all subdiagonals of the social contact matrix.
this approach is supported by the fact that people age with time and thus motivates smoothly varying contact rates from a cohort angle.
two approaches that allow for smoothing of social contact data over cohorts are proposed namely 1 reordering of the diagonal components of the social contact matrix and 2 reordering of the penalty matrix associated with the diagonal components.
parameter estimation is done in the likelihood framework by using constrained penalized iterative reweighted least squares cpirls under poisson and negative binomial distributional assumptions for the observed contacts.
a simulation study underlines the benefits of cohortbased smoothing based on two scalar measures of performance.

"the global application of  acari phytoseiidae as a biological control agent across various protected crops has proven effective against a range of insect pests like thrips and whiteflies as well as pest mites like broad mites and russet mites.
optimization of rearing  under laboratory conditions is crucial for further studies of this species to improve their application in integrated pest management ipm programs.
here we evaluated the development and reproduction of  when fed on four different diets including cattail pollen  living dried fruit mites  frozen  eggs and a mixed diet of frozen  eggs and  pollen.
females consuming the mixed diet exhibited superior total fecundity and daily oviposition rate along with the highest intrinsic rate of increase r and net productive rate r among all diets tested.
the immature period was significantly longer for mites on a diet of living  compared to those on other diets.
importantly utilizing frozen  eggs and  pollen mitigates the risk of infestation and contamination from the living dried fruit mites which is important for laboratory and field settings when releasing the predator colonies.
our findings not only present an optimized rearing method for predatory mites under laboratory conditions but also suggest potential broader applications for enhancing the effectiveness and sustainability of biological control strategies across various agroecosystems and reducing dependency on chemical pesticides."
"common bean phaseolus vulgaris l. is one of the most important pulse crops in ethiopia contributing to income generation and food security.
information on the genetic variability and trait associations of common bean in the sekota district of north western ethiopia is inadequate.
this study was initiated with the objective to assess variability heritability and trait association among 64 common bean genotypes for quantitative traits using 8x8 simple lattice design at aybra main research site 2023 under rain fed conditions.
analysis of variance was performed using sas software and the anova revealed highly significant variations among genotypes for all the traits considered in the study.
the yield ranged from 1633.1 to 3702.10 kg ha with a mean of 2542.53 kg ha.
there was a yield advantage of 24.56 to 55.89 over the checks.
a moderate genotypic coefficient of variation coupled with high heritability and high genetic advance as a percentage of the mean was obtained for plant height branches per plant hundred seed weight seed yield and harvest index.
branches per plant aboveground biomass and harvest index had significant positive correlations and direct effects on seed yield at the genotypic and phenotypic levels while days to maturity had a significant negative correlation and indirect effect with seed yield at the genotypic.
the maximum inter cluster distance was found between clusters vii and 8 d 351.39 followed by clusters v and viii d 331.23. the first five principal component axes accounted for 74.3 of the total variation with eigenvalues greater than unity.
the number of days to maturity plant height number of pods per plant number seeds per pod seed yield and harvest index were the traits that contributed most of the variation in the first pcs.
generally the presence of variability and strong positive association of traits among the genotypes were observed in the traits under study.
therefore selection based on agronomic performance and hybridization based on cluster distance could be possible for the improvement of common bean in the study area."
"polyamines are abundant and physiologically essential biomolecules that play a role in numerous processes but are disrupted in diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular and neurological disorders.
despite their importance measuring free polyamine concentrations and monitoring their metabolism and uptake in cells in realtime remains impossible due to the lack of appropriate biosensors.

we demonstrate the utility of ipasnfr for detecting polyamine import into mammalian cells to the cytoplasm mitochondria and the nucleus.
we demonstrate that these sensors are useful to probe the activity of polyamine transporters and to uncover biochemical pathways underlying the distribution of polyamines amongst organelles.
the sensors powered a highthroughput small molecule compound library screen revealing multiple compounds in different chemical classes that strongly modulate cellular polyamine levels.
these sensors will be powerful tools to investigate the complex interplay between polyamine uptake and metabolic pathways address open questions about their role in health and disease and enable screening for therapeutic polyamine modulators."
"dosagesensitive genes have characteristic patterns of evolution that include being refractory to smallscale duplication depleted on human benign copy number variants cnvs and enriched on pathogenic cnvs.
this intolerance to copy number change is likely due to an expression constraint that exists in one or more tissues.
while genomic copy number changes alter the encompassed genes expression across all tissues expression quantitative trait loci eqtls genomic regions harbouring sequence variants that influence the expression level of one or more genes can act in a tissuespecific manner.
in this work we examine expression variation of presumed dosagesensitive and nondosagesensitive genes to discover how the locus duplicability constraints translate into gene expression constraints.
here we test the hypothesis that expression changes due to the presence of eqtls acting in unconstrained tissues will not be deleterious and thus allow dosagesensitive genes to vary expression while obeying constraints in other tissues.
using eqtls across 48 human tissues from the genotypetissue expression gtex project  we find that dosagesensitive genes are enriched for being affected by eqtls and that the eqtls affecting dosagesensitive genes are biased towards having narrow tissuespecificity with these genes having fewer eqtlaffected tissues than nondosagesensitive genes.
additionally we find that dosagesensitive genes are depleted for being affected by broad tissue breadth eqtls likely due to the increased chance of these eqtls conflicting with expression constraints and being removed by purifying selection.
these patterns suggest that dosagesensitivity shapes the evolution of these genes by precluding copy number evolution and restricting their evolutionary trajectories to changes in expression regulation compatible with their functional constraints.
thus deeper interpretation of the patterns of constraints can be informative of the temporal or spatial location of the gene dosage sensitivity and contribute to our understanding of functional genomics."
"enteropeptidase ep enterokinase is a serine protease that regulates intestinal protein digestion by converting trypsinogen into active trypsin and thus initiates activation of the pancreatic zymogen cascade.
chronic inhibition of ep and trypsin ept with camostat foipan foy305 or its active metabolite foy251 causes weight loss in obese mice by reducing intestinal protein absorption and suppression of food intake however the mechanisms leading to appetite suppression are not well understood.
we tested the hypothesis that cholecystokinin cck signaling mediates the anorectic effects of ept inhibition using a cck1r inhibitor loxiglumide or cck1r knockout ko mice.
acute treatment with loxiglumide was able to partially reverse foy251induced gallbladder contraction and delayed gastric emptying in mice.
chronic coadministration of loxiglumide reversed foy251 mediated effects on food intake and metabolism in dietinduced obese dio mice.
chronic dosing of foy251 caused similar reductions in food intake but greater weight loss in cck1r ko mice compared to wildtype wt mice primarily due to fat mass loss.
pair fed pf groups revealed food intakedependent and independent mechanisms of weight loss by foy251.
notably foy251 treatment induced sustained weight loss whereas body weight loss rebounded in pf animals.
in cckr1 ko mice foy251 caused greater weight loss and increased protein calorie loss relative to that in wt mice while having no effect on glycemic control or fgf21.
hence cck1rdependent and independent mechanisms modulate the metabolic effects of ept inhibition and may play a role in maintaining weight loss by this mechanism."

"background.
prenatal alcohol exposure is a leading cause of permanent neurodevelopmental disability.
diagnosis is often initiated by a distinctive craniofacial appearance that originates in part from the apoptotic deletion of craniofacial progenitors a stem cell lineage called the neural crest nc.
we recently demonstrated that alcohol causes nucleolar stress in nc through its suppression of ribosome biogenesis rbg and this suppression is causative in their p53mdm2mediated apoptosis.
here we show that this nucleolar stress originates from alcohols activation of ampk which suppresses torc1 and the p70s6kmediated stimulation of rbg.
methods.
alcoholexposed cells of the pluripotent primary cranial nc line o91 were evaluated with respect to their p70s6k torc1 and ampk activity.
the functional impact of these signals with respect to rbg p53 and apoptosis were assessed using gainoffunction constructs and small molecule mediators.
results.
alcohol rapidly 2hr increased pampk praptor and reduced both total and pp70s6k in nc cells.
these changes persisted for at least 12hr to 18hr following alcohol exposure.
attenuation of these signals via gain or lossoffunction approaches prevented alcohols suppression of rrna synthesis and the induction of p53stimulated apoptosis.
conclusions.
we conclude that alcohol induces ribosome dysbiogenesis and activates their p53mdm2mediated apoptosis via its activation of pampk which in turn activates raptor to suppress the torc1s6kmediated promotion of ribosome biogenesis.
this represents a novel mechanism underlying alcohols neurotoxicity and is consistent with findings that torc1s6k networks are critical for cranial nc survival."
"disrupted intestinal epithelial barrier function has been proposed to be integral to rheumatoid arthritis ra progression and pathogenesis.
to further define the molecular pathways in synovial inflammation and a response of the intestinal tissues we have now used a rat model of monojoint inflammatory arthritis induced by intraarticular injection iai of complete freunds adjuvant cfa.
the predominant inflammatory response of a single injection of the adjuvant into the knee joint resulted in rapid and reproducible formation of a fibrotic myeloidinfiltrated synovial pannus.
our aim was to determine how intestinal tissues including the proximal and distal ileum and distal colon respond to inflammatory changes in the synovium in a temporally coordinated manner by comparing their transcriptomic landscapes using rnaseq analyses.
we confirmed the timeline of joint inflammation by knee joint swelling measurement synovial fluid levels of the acute phase protein interαtrypsin inhibitor heavy chains itih and demonstrated a selfcorrecting response of trabecular and cortical bone to the cfa challenge.
intestinespecific responses were monitored by 16s microbiome amplicon sequencing histopathology for mucus layer integrity and immune cell immunohistochemistry.
we present data showing that the intestinal tissue response to the acute joint inflammation was region specific with the ileum primarily responding with increased mucus secretion and silencing of t cell specific pathways whereas the colon showed a transient upregulation of macrophages with a broader suppression of immune related and metabolic pathway related transcripts.
however at no time after cfaiai were there significant changes in the fecal microbiome composition of the ileum or the colon.
in summary our data report for the first time a suppression of intestinal inflammatory and immune responses following the induction of joint inflammation and only minimal and transient changes in the microbiome."
"sex chromosome turnover has occurred in many groups and is mediated by the translocation or duplication of apical sexdetermining genes or the replacement of original sex determination genes by new ones.
in dioecious plants the former frequently occurs while the latter is rarely reported.
here we assembled four haplotyperesolved chromosomelevel genomes from four lineages of the salix polyclona complex including three diploids e ets and w1 and one autotetraploid w2.
our analyses reveal that diploids have a zwzz system while autotetraploid has a zzzwzzzz system on chromosome 15. the apical sexdetermining genes of salicaceae arr17like duplicates on chromosomes 15 and 19 which can indirectly turnonoff the expression of pistillata pi gene and determine sex appears to have lost the function of sex determination in the s. polyclona complex.
we found a novel sex determining factor on the 15w of the complex namely partial pilike duplicates which has taken over the function from the arr17like duplicates.
in conclusion a new dominant sexdetermining gene was recruited in the s. polyclona complex replacing the ancestral apical sexdetermining arr17like duplicates.
the newly identified partial pilike duplicates exhibit a direct influence on the downstream intact pilike duplications providing valuable insights into the evolutionary trajectory of the topdown sex determination pathway."
"emerging evidence suggests that nrf2 plays a procarcinogenic role in cancer.
our previous study showed that arsenicinduced nrf2 activation triggers metabolic reprogramming leading to the formation of cancer stemlike cells.
here we further demonstrated that klf4 a key pluripotency factor is a direct transcriptional target of nrf2 in arsenicexposed human bronchial epithelial cells.
chipseq analysis identified multiple nrf2 binding peaks at the klf4 gene locus which overlap with the enhancer markers h3k4me1 and h3k27ac.
nrf2 knockout reduced both klf4 expression and enhancer marker enrichment accompanied by a global decrease in klf4 binding across the genome.
in wildtype wt cells arsenic treatment increased klf4 binding on genes involved in oncogenic pathways such as stat3 sox2 nrf2 cell growth hedgehog and emt.
we also found that klf4 engages in a selffeedback loop in response to nrf2 signaling.
lastly our data showed that the cooccupancy of nrf2 and klf4 is crucial for establishing active enhancer hubs in the genome.
these findings suggest that the oncogenic effects of nrf2 are in part mediated by nrf2 dependent selfamplification of klf4 expression and function.
thus targeting both nrf2 and klf4 could be a promising therapeutic strategy for eliminating cancer stemlike cells."
"wild birds serve as reservoirs and vectors for many different pathogens and changes in their distribution and abundance due to environmental change will influence disease risk.
we study three species which are highly abundant in northwestern europe and which can transmit a wide range of diseases including avian influenza and west nile virus blackbirds mallards and house sparrows.
using the netherlands as a case study we created random forest models for predicting the distribution and abundance of these species both now and in the future.
climate land use and vegetative cover were all important predictors of bird abundance.
the three species had different spatial distributions largely related to their preferred habitat and food availability.
in the future mallard and house sparrow populations were predicted to increase while there was little change for blackbirds.
quantifying the consequences of these abundance changes is complicated as there are many factors to consider however increased pathogen reservoirs will likely increase disease risk and changes in distribution may affect local outbreak risk.
the future abundance maps created in this study and the methods used to create them will be useful tools for disease modellers and policymakers to estimate future disease risk and to plan accordingly."
"kidney fibrosis characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition is a progressive disease that despite affecting 10 of the population lacks specific treatments and suitable biomarkers.

using transcriptomics proteomics phosphoproteomics and secretomics we quantified over 14000 biomolecules across seven time points following tgfβ stimulation.
this revealed distinct temporal patterns in the expression and activity of known and potential kidney fibrosis markers and modulators.
data integration resulted in timeresolved multiomic network models which allowed us to propose mechanisms related to fibrosis progression through early transcriptional reprogramming.
using sirna knockdowns and phenotypic assays we validated predictions and regulatory mechanisms underlying kidney fibrosis.
in particular we show that several earlyactivated transcription factors including fli1 and e2f1 act as negative regulators of collagen deposition and propose underlying molecular mechanisms.

"communication between cells in metazoan organisms is mediated by a remarkably small number of highly conserved signaling pathways.
given the relatively small number of signaling pathways the existence of multiple related ligands for many of these pathways is thought to represent a key evolutionary innovation for encoding complexity into cellcell signaling.

"although generally unknown the age of a newly diagnosed tumor encodes valuable etiologic and prognostic information.
here we estimate the age of breast cancers defined as the time from the start of growth to detection using a measure of epigenetic entropy derived from genomewide methylation arrays.
based on an ensemble of neutrally fluctuating cpg fcpg sites this stochastic epigenetic clock differs from conventional clocks that measure agerelated increases in methylation.
we show that younger tumors exhibit hallmarks of aggressiveness such as increased proliferation and genomic instability whereas older tumors are characterized by elevated immune infiltration indicative of enhanced immune surveillance.
these findings suggest that the clock captures a tumor’s effective growth rate resulting from the evolutionaryecological competition between intrinsic growth potential and external systemic pressures.
because of the clock’s ability to delineate old and stable from young and aggressive tumors it has potential applications in risk stratification of earlystage breast cancers and guiding early detection efforts."

"stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide.
atrial myopathy including fibrosis is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke but the mechanisms underlying this association are poorly understood.
fibrosis modifies myocardial structure impairing electrical propagation and tissue biomechanics and creating stagnant flow regions where clots could form.
fibrosis can be mapped noninvasively using late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging lgemri.
however fibrosis maps are not currently incorporated into stroke risk calculations or computational electromechanofluidic models.
we present multiphysics simulations of left atrial la myocardial motion and hemodynamics using patientspecific anatomies and fibrotic maps from lgemri.
we modify tissue stiffness and active tension generation in fibrotic regions and investigate how these changes affect la flow for different fibrotic burdens.
we find that fibrotic regions and to a lesser extent nonfibrotic regions experience reduced myocardial strain resulting in decreased la emptying fraction consistent with clinical observations.
both fibrotic tissue stiffening and hypocontractility independently reduce la function but together these two alterations cause more pronounced effects than either one alone.
fibrosis significantly alters flow patterns throughout the atrial chamber and particularly the filling and emptying jets of the left atrial appendage laa.
the effects of fibrosis in la flow are largely captured by the concomitant changes in la emptying fraction except inside the laa where a multifactorial behavior is observed.
this work illustrates how highfidelity multiphysics models can be used to study thrombogenesis mechanisms in patientspecific anatomies shedding light onto the links between atrial fibrosis and ischemic stroke."
"certain mutations can confer neomorphic gain of function gof activities to the p53 protein that affect cancer progression.
yet the concept of mutant p53 gof has been challenged.
here using various strategies to alter the status of mutant versions of p53 in different cell lines we demonstrate that mutant p53 stimulates cancer cell invasion in threedimensional environments.
mechanistically mutant p53 enhances rhoarockdependent cell contractility and cellmediated extracellular matrix ecm reorganization via increasing mevalonate pathwaydependent rhoa localization to the membrane.
in line with this rhoadependent proinvasive activity is also mediated by idi1 a mevalonate pathway product.
further the invasionenhancing effect of mutant p53 is dictated by the biomechanical properties of the surrounding ecm thereby adding a cellindependent layer of regulation to mutant p53 gof activity that is mediated by dynamic reciprocal cellecm interactions.
together our findings link mutant p53 metabolic gof activity with an invasive cellular phenotype in physiologically relevant and contextdependent settings."
"altered patterns of visual social attention preference detected using eyetracking and a variety of different paradigms are increasingly proposed as sensitive biomarkers for autism spectrum disorder.
however few eye tracking studies have compared the relative efficacy of different paradigms to discriminate between autistic compared with typically developing children and their sensitivity to specific symptoms.
to target this issue the current study used three common eye tracking protocols contrasting social versus nonsocial stimuli in young 27 years old chinese autistic n  35 and typically developing n  34 children matched for age and gender.
protocols included dancing people .
dynamic geometrical images biological motion dynamic light point walking human or cat .
nonbiological motion scrambled controls and child playing with toy .
toy alone.
although all three paradigms differentiated autistic and typically developing children the dancing people versus dynamic geometry pattern paradigm was the most effective with autistic children showing marked reductions in visual preference for dancing people and correspondingly increased one for geometric patterns.
furthermore this altered visual preference in autistic children was correlated with the ados social affect score and had the highest discrimination accuracy.
our results therefore indicate that decreased visual preference for dynamic social stimuli may be the most effective visual attentionbased paradigm for use as a biomarker for autism in chinese children.

"objective
the presence of autoantibodies to citrullinated protein antigens acpas in the absence of clinicallyapparent inflammatory arthritis ia identifies individuals atrisk for developing future clinical rheumatoid arthritis ra.
however it is unclear why some acpa individuals convert to clinical ra while others do not.
we explored the possibility in the targeting immune responses for prevention of rheumatoid arthritis tipra study that epigenetic remodeling is part of the trajectory from an atrisk state to clinical disease and identifies novel biomarkers associated with conversion to clinical ra.
methods
acpa controls acpa atrisk and early ra individuals were followed for up to 5 years including obtaining blood samples annually and at ra diagnosis.
peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs were separated into cd19 b cells memory cd4 t cells and naive cd4 t cells using antibodies and magnetic beads.
genomewide methylation within each cell lineage was assayed using the illumina methylationepic v1.0 beadchip.
acpa atrisk participants who did or did not develop ra were designated prera or nonconverters respectively.
differentially methylated loci dml were selected using the limma software package.
using the caret package we constructed machine learning models in test and validation cohorts and identified the most predictive loci of clinical ra conversion.
results
crosssectional differential methylation analysis at baseline revealed dmls that distinguish the prera methylome from acpa nonconverters the latter which closely resembled acpa controls.
genes overlapping these dmls correspond to aberrant notch signaling and dna repair pathways in b cells.
longitudinal analysis showed that acpa control and acpa nonconverter methylomes are relatively constant.
in contrast the prera methylome remodeled along a dynamic ra methylome trajectory characterized by epigenetic changes in active regulatory elements.
clinical conversion to ra defined based on diagnosis marked an epigenetic inflection point for cell cycle pathways in b cells and adaptive immunity pathways in naive t cells.
machine learning revealed individual loci associated with ra conversion.
this model significantly outperformed autoantibodies plus acute phase reactants as predictors of ra conversion.
conclusion
dna methylation is a dynamic process in acpa individuals atrisk for developing ra that eventually transition to clinical disease.
in contrast nonconverters and controls have stable methylomes.
the accumulation of epigenetic marks over time prior to conversion to clinical ra conforms to pathways that are associated with immunity and can be used to identify potential pathogenic pathways for therapeutic targeting andor use as prognostic biomarkers."
"predicting mhcii restricted epitopes across species used to be challenging but alphafold af may provide a structurebased panprediction solution.
in this study we established the new tool afpred with a clear standard for quantitative prediction results.
compared to the sequencebased tools heavily trained with human ligandome afpred does not show an advantage in predicting the binding patterns of human hlaii but has far better performance in predicting the binding patterns of other animals mhcii.
using recently resolved bat mhcii structures we analyzed afpreds prediction capability logic and limitation.
in addition we also explored the impact of af algorithm iterations on the prediction of mhcii restricted epitopes.
the results demonstrated that afpred is capable of crossspecies prediction of mhcii restricted epitopes and is conducive to the development of novel veterinary vaccines."
"the killing mechanism of many antibiotics involves the induction of dna damage either directly or indirectly which triggers the sos response.
reca the master regulator of the sos response plays a crucial role in driving the evolution of resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics treated with a single dose of ciprofloxacin.
however the precise roles of reca and sos responses in the development of resistance under shortterm βlactam exposure remain unclear.
in the present study we observed a fast evolution of βlactam resistance 20fold increase in mic in 8 hours in e. coli after deleting reca and exposing the bacteria to a single dose of ampicillin.
notably once this type of resistance is established it remains stable and can be passed on to subsequent generations.
unlike earlier studies we found that the rapid development of resistance relies on the hindrance of dna repair a mechanism that operates independently of the sos response.
additionally we identified the rapid emergence of drug resistance associated mutations in the resistant bacterial genome indicating the impairment of dna repair.
through comprehensive transcriptome sequencing we discovered that the expression of numerous antioxidative response genes is repressed in reca mutant resistant isolates resulting in an excessive accumulation of ros within the cells.
this suggests that the induction of ros drives the fast evolution of antibiotic resistance in recadeficient bacteria.
collectively we show that the hindrance of dna repair hampers cellular fitness provides bacteria with genetic adaptability to survive in diverse stressful environments and accelerates the evolution of antibiotic resistance."

nichenet predicted how differentially expressed genes might impact hismcs and other bowel cells.
results loading induced differential expression of 4537 genes in hismcs.
loaded hismcs had a less contractile phenotype with increased expression of synthetic smc genes proinflammatory cytokines and altered expression of axon guidance molecules growth factors and morphogens.
many differentially expressed genes encode secreted ligands that could act cellautonomously on smooth muscle and on other cells in the bowel wall.
discussion hismcs demonstrate remarkably rapid phenotypic plasticity in response to mechanical stress that may convert contractile hismcs into proliferative fibroblastlike cells or proinflammatory cells.
these mechanical stressinduced changes in hismc gene expression may be relevant for human bowel disease."
"this research proposes a novel technique for acquiring a large amount of highdensity highprecision 3d point cloud data for plants.
we propose two methods multimasked matching mmm and the closedloop coarsetofine method clcfm.
the proposed approach addresses challenges in reconstructing plant 3d point clouds from allaround images using sfm and multiview stereo methods.
given the complex structure of plants with thin objects like leaves and stems overlapping reconstructing accurate 3d point clouds presents significant challenges.
one of these is occlusion where points in the 3d point cloud cannot be obtained due to overlapping parts preventing accurate point capture.
another is the generation of erroneous points in nonexistent locations due to image matching errors along object outlines.
the mmm mitigates these problems through an iterative process that alternates between locally generating point clouds and refining these point clouds by removing erroneous points using mask images.
the proposed pipeline enables the construction of plant 3d point clouds with minimal noise and fewer missing points.
by facilitating the acquisition of highdensity highprecision 3d data on a large number of plant bodies as required for research activities the proposed method is expected to enable comparative analysis of visible phenotypes in the growth process of a wide range of plant species based on 3d information."

additionally we have streamlined and simplified the process of stable transformation and selection of  reducing cost time and manual labour without compromising transformation efficiency.
the addition of sucrose in the selection media significantly enhances the production of gemmae accelerating the generation of isogenic plants.
we believe these protocols have the potential to facilitate highthroughput screenings in diverse plant species and represent a significant step towards the full automation of plant transformation pipelines.

"individuals plastically adjust their signaling behavior depending on the social context of an interaction but which aspects of context elicit the strongest responses from individuals is often difficult to determine.
to explore how internal and external contextual factors influence the communication of house mice we employed a splitcage playback assay to assess how dominant and subordinate male mice differed in their ultrasonic vocalization usv production in response to playback of broadband vocalizations bbvs or squeaks.
we assessed how individuals altered their behavior depending on the odors present during the assay either just female odors fem condition or female odors in addition to the odors of potential competitors other males femmale condition.
using this repeatedmeasures design we evaluated two distinct cohorts of individuals males exposed to the odor of familiar competitors in the femmale condition familiar odor cohort and males exposed to the odor of unfamiliar competitors in the femmale condition unfamiliar odor cohort.
while dominants and subordinates did not differ in their baseline vocal production or response to squeaks all groups reduced their vocal production in response to bbv playback and the addition of unfamiliar male odor prompted mice to decrease their baseline levels of calling and decrease the complexity of their vocal repertoire.
importantly this effect of additional male odor was not present when individuals were presented with male odor familiar to them.
these findings suggest that mice alter their vocal behavior during courtship interactions in response to cues that indicate the presence of potential competitors and this response is modulated by the familiarity of these competitor cues."
"βadrenergic blockers βblockers are extensively utilized in the treatment of various cardiovascular conditions.
however their direct effects on insulin secretion from pancreatic βcells remain largely unexplored.
this study investigates the impact of βblockers on insulin secretion utilizing min6k8 clonal βcells and mouse islets in vitro.
various nonselective and β1selective βblockers were found to amplify glucose and glimepirideinduced insulin secretion 1.52 fold.
surprisingly some of the βblockers propranolol and bisoprolol were found to increase camp production 510 fold via adenylyl cyclase the effects being dependent on α2adrenoceptors which suggests crossreactivity of these βblockers and their receptors.
propranololstimulated insulin secretion involves a novel signaling pathway mediated by protein kinase a pka ryanodine receptor 2 ryr2 and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily m member 5 trpm5.
initially camp activates pka and triggers ryr2 phosphorylation and extracellular ca influx leading to cainduced ca release cicr.
subsequently cicr activates trpm5 resulting in augmented extracellular ca influx through the ltype voltagedependent ca channel vdcc.
remarkably propranololstimulated insulin secretion exhibited greater efficacy in diabetic mouse islets than in lean mouse islets suggesting a potential strategy for the restoration of campstimulated insulin secretion in diabetic βcells.

here we focus on avrstb6 a major effector of the global wheat pathogen  evolving in response to the cognate receptor stb6 a resistance widely deployed in wheat.
we comprehensively captured effector gene evolution by analyzing a global thousandgenome panel using referencefree sequence analyses.
we found that avrstb6 has diversified into 59 protein isoforms with a strong association to the pathogen spreading to new continents.
across europe we found the strongest differentiation of the effector consistent with high rates of stb6 deployment.
the  locus showed also a remarkable diversification in transposable element content with specific expansion patterns across the globe.
we detected the  gene losses and evidence for transposable elementmediated disruptions.
we used genomewide association mapping data to predict virulence emergence and found marked increases in europe followed by spread to subsequently colonized continents.
finally we genotyped french bread wheat cultivars for stb6 and monitored resistant cultivar deployment concomitant with avrstb6 evolution.
taken together our data provides a comprehensive view of how a rapidly diversifying effector locus can undergo largescale sequence changes concomitant with gains in virulence on resistant cultivars.

"despite the growing interest in mirrorimage loligonucleotides both as a robust nucleic acid analogue and as an artificial genetic polymer their broader adoption in research and medicine remains hindered by challenges associated with the synthesis of long sequences especially for lrna.
herein we present a novel strategy for assembling long lrnas via the joining of two or more shorter fragments using crosschiral ligase ribozymes together with new substrate activation chemistry.
we show that 5′monophosphorylated lrna which is readily prepared by solid phase synthesis can be activated by chemical attachment of a 5′adenosine monophosphate amp or diphosphate adp yielding 5′adenosyl dior tri phosphate lrna.
the activation reaction is performed in mild aqueous conditions proceeds efficiently with short or large lrna and yielding few biproducts requires little or no further purification after activation.
importantly both groups when added to lrna are compatible with ribozymemediated ligation with the 5′adenosyl triphosphate permitting rapid and efficient joining of multiple long lrna strands.
this is exemplified by the assembly of a 129nt lrna molecule via a single crosschiral ligation event.
overall by relying on ribozymes that can be readily prepared by  transcription and lrna substrates that can be activated through simple chemistry these methods are expected to make long lrnas more accessible to a wider range of researchers and facilitate the expansion of lonbased technologies."

to enable ocs and oma in polyploid species new theoretical results were derived to 1 predict midparent heterosis due to dominance and 2 control inbreeding in a population of arbitrary ploidy.
a new convex optimization framework for oma named coma was developed and released as public software.
under stochastic simulation of a genomic selection program coma maintained a target inbreeding rate of 0.5 using either pedigree or genomic ibd kinship.
significantly more genetic gain was realized with pedigree kinship which is consistent with previous studies showing the selective advantage of an individual under ocs is dominated by its mendelian sampling term.
despite the higher accuracy 0.2–0.3 when predicting mate performance with oma compared to ocs there was little longterm gain advantage.
the sparsity of the coma mating design and flexibility to incorporate mating constraints offer practical incentives over ocs.

after showing that all three isoforms fulfill the same metabolic function we evidenced that the impaired root growth in h2 results from an altered cell cycle progression concomitant to a lower target of rapamycin kinase activity.
subsequent metabolomic approaches revealed an accumulation of storage sugars and a significant decrease of the tca intermediates and several vitamins in the h2 root cells as compared to the wildtype ones.
additional investigations evidenced that h2 acts as the main relay for lipoylation in root mitochondria which diverges from the current lipoylation model proposed for photosynthetic tissues.

"recognition of subtle emotional facial expressions is challenging for some individuals with autism spectrum disorders asd.
training that targets recognition of low intensity emotional expressions may therefore be effective as an intervention to improve socialemotional skills.
this paper reports the results of two randomised controlled experiments looking at the effect of a training methodology designed to increase the recognition of happy emotion in low intensity happy facial expressions.
the first study implements this training with children with autism spectrum disorder asd n  14 and the second study implements this training with adults with asd n  27. the training paradigm used images from a morph sequence that mixed a happy expression with a mixedemotion ‘norm’ expression to create a sequence of varying intensity happy expressions.
participants were asked to say whether or not individual faces from the sequence were happy to measure their happiness detection threshold.
participants that received active training were given biased feedback to shift their detection threshold while participants that received control training were given feedback consistent with their baseline threshold.
there was some statistical evidence that thresholds in the active training group shifted more than in the control group.
this suggests training was successful in increasing the number of expressions that individuals identified as happy.
however there was no evidence that training increased facial expression recognition accuracy as measured by the reading the mind in the eyes task completed after training study 2."

to achieve this we have developed the deep learningbased herro framework which corrects ont simplex reads while carefully preserving differences in related genomic sequences.
taking into account informative positions that differentiate the haplotypes or genomic repeat copies herro achieves an increase of read accuracy of up to 100fold for diploid human genomes.
by combining herro with verkko assembler we achieve high contiguity on several human genomes by reconstructing many chromosomes telomeretotelomere including chromosomes x and y. herro supports both r9.4.1 and r10.4.1 ont simplex reads and generalizes well to other species.

"extinction is considered a core mechanism underlying exposurebased therapy in anxietyrelated disorders.
however marked impairments in threat extinction learning coupled with impaired neuroplasticity in patients strongly impede the efficacy of exposurebased interventions.
recent translational research suggests a role of the reninangiotensin ra system in both these processes.
however the efficacy of pharmacological modulation of the ra system to enhance threat extinction in humans and the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear.
the present preregistered randomized placebocontrolled pharmacological neuroimaging trial demonstrates that preextinction administration of the angiotensin ii type 1 receptor antagonist losartan accelerated attenuation of the psychophysiological threat response during extinction.
on the neural level the acceleration of extinction was accompanied by threatsignal specific enhanced ventromedial prefrontal cortex vmpfc activation and its coupling with the basolateral amygdala.
multivoxel pattern analysis and voxelwise mediation analysis further revealed that that losartan reduced the neural threat expression particularly in the vmpfc and confirmed that acceleration of extinction critically involved treatmentinduced modulation of vmpfc activation.
overall the results provide the first evidence for a pivotal role of the ra system in extinction learning in humans and suggest that adjunct losartan administration can be leveraged to facilitate the efficacy of extinctionbased therapies."

"despite recent advances in the computational design of protein binders designing proteins that bind with high affinity to polar protein targets remains an outstanding problem.
here we show that rfdiffusion can be conditioned to efficiently generate protein scaffolds that form geometrically matched extended betasheets with target protein edge betastrands in which polar groups on the target are nearly perfectly complemented with hydrogen bonding groups on the design.
we use this approach to design binders against a set of therapeutically relevant polar targets kit pdgfrɑ alk2 alk3 fcrl5 and nrp1 and find that betastrandtargeted design yields higher affinities and success rates than unconditioned rfdiffusion.
all by all binding experiments show that the designs have affinities ranging from 76 pm to mid nm for their targets and essentially no off target binding despite the sharing of betastrand interactions likely reflecting the precise customization of interacting betastrand geometry and additional designed bindertarget interactions.
a cocrystal structure of one such design in complex with the kit receptor is nearly identical to the computational design model confirming the accuracy of the design approach.
the ability to robustly generate binders displaying high affinity and specificity to polar interaction surfaces with exposed betastrands considerably increases the range and capabilities of computational binder design."
"rapidly dividing cells can eliminate slow growing neighbors through the apoptotic process of cell competition.
this process ensures that only high fitness cells populate embryonic tissues and is proposed to underlie the ability of oncogenetransformed cells to progressively replace normal cells within a tissue.
patches of cells in the  wing disc overexpressing the oncogenic taiman tai transcriptional coactivator kill normal neighbors by secreting spz ligands that trigger proapoptotic toll signaling in receiving cells.
however extracellular signaling mechanisms responsible for elimination of slow growing cells by normal neighbors remain poorly defined.
here we show that slow growing cells with reduced tai tai are killed by normal neighbors through a mechanism involving competition for the wingless wgwnt ligand.
elevated wg signaling significantly rescues elimination of tai cells in multiple organs suggesting that tai may normally promote wg activity.
examining distribution of wg components reveals that tai promotes extracellular spread of the wg ligand from source cells across the wing disc thus ensuring patterned expression of multiple wgregulated target genes.
tai controls wg spread indirectly through the extracellular glypican dallylike protein dlp which binds wg and promotes its extracellular diffusion and capture by receptors.

"following the development of regressionbased methods to estimate natural and sexual selection evolutionary biologists have quantified the strength mode and direction of selection in natural populations.
although this approach has been successful its limitations include lack of replication across species compromising the generality of the inferences beyond microevolutionary time scales.
here we carried out a comparative study of selection on wing shape and body size across multiple populations of two closely related and ecologically similar pond damselflies enallagma cyathigerum and ischnura elegans odonata coenagrionidae.
we found weak stabilizing selection on wing shape in both sexes and no evidence that selection on this trait differed between the species.
in contrast selection on body size was curvilinear in males and directional in females and they differed in form males and intensity females between these two species.
by analyzing selection on the finegrained spatial scale we found that selection on male body size was shaped by the local mating system and the relationship between mating system characteristics and directional selection was remarkably consistent across these species.
finally we present a graphical model that links contemporary selection and macroevolution.
based on this model we conclude that the persistence in ecological modes of life in pond damselflies offers a plausible explanation for why varying selection in nature may still result in a stable adaptive zone lasting millions of years."
"determining why convergent traits use distinct versus shared genetic components is crucial for understanding how evolutionary processes generate and sustain biodiversity.
however the factors dictating the genetic underpinnings of convergent traits remain incompletely understood.
here we use heterologous protein expression biochemical assays and phylogenetic analyses to confirm the origin of a luciferase gene from haloalkane dehalogenases in the brittle star .
through database searches and gene tree analyses we also show a complex pattern of presence and absence of haloalkane dehalogenases across organismal genomes.
these results first confirm parallel evolution across a vast phylogenetic distance because octocorals like  also use luciferase derived from haloalkane dehalogenases.
this parallel evolution is surprising even though previously hypothesized because many organisms that also use coelenterazine as the bioluminescence substrate evolved completely distinct luciferases.
the inability to detect haloalkane dehalogenases in the genomes of several bioluminescent groups suggests that the distribution of this gene family influences its recruitment as a luciferase.
together our findings highlight how biochemical function and genomic availability help determine whether distinct or shared genetic components are used during the convergent evolution of traits like bioluminescence."
"fusobacterium necrophorum is an important pathogen associated with several infectious diseases in cattle.
however recent sequencingbased studies have indicated that f. necrophorum is positively associated with pregnancy in beef cows and that fusobacterium is the most abundant genus in the bull seminal microbiota suggesting the potential role of fusobacterium in reproductive health and fertility.
here we performed a comprehensive screening to 1 determine whether fusobacterium necrophorum subspecies necrophorum fnn and funduliforme fnf and fusobacterium varium fv are part of the commensal members of the reproductive microbiota in cattle 2 to explore whether these fusobacterium spp.
are colonized in calf prenatally.
for this we screened 11 different sample types including bovine and ram semen bovine vaginal and uterine swabs and bull fecal samples as well as samples from 180 and 260days old calf fetuses and their respective dams using both quantitative pcr 514 samples and targeted culturing 499 samples.
by qpcr all the targeted fusobacterium spp.
were detected across all sample types with fnf being the highly prevalent in the bull semen 66.7 and maternal ruminal fluids 87.1 which was confirmed by culturing.
all the targeted fusobacterium were identified in vaginal and uterine 3.19.4 as well as placental caruncles and fetal fluids ruminal and meconium samples 2.7  26.3 by qpcr and were not isolated by culture method.
overall our results suggest that f. necrophorum is a commensal member of healthy male reproductive microbiota and that fnf fnn and fv are present in bovine vaginouterine microbiota and calf intestine prenatally."

"humans have spent approximately 99.5 of the 2.5 million years of evolutionary history as huntergatherers which helped to evolutionarily mold our minds and bodies to the hunting and gathering lifestyle.
physical activity associated with hunting animals gathering plants and evading predators is essential for human survival evolution and prosperity.
thus physical activity acute stress is mostly beneficial to the body whereas psychoemotional stress chronic stress is usually detrimental at the psychological physiological and pathological levels.
although physical activity exerts anticancer effects and psychoemotional stress exhibits cancerpromoting effects both function through the same pathway involving activation of the sympathetic nervous system release of catecholamines and stimulation of β2 adrenergic receptor β2ar expressed on cancer cells.
here salmeterol xinafoate was chosen to mimic physical activity.
a onceweekly administration of salmeterol xinafoate by the intraperitoneal inhalation or transdermal route dosedependently extended latency reduced cancer incidence and growth and prolonged survival in vivo.
remarkably the best complete response rates were 75 30 and 71.43 for the therapeutic treatment of lung cancer breast cancer and melanoma respectively.
notably the salmeterol xinafoate doses used in our experiments are comparable to those used in patients.
moreover in endogenous β2ar knockout cancer cells the exogenous β2ar mutant with impaired salmeterol xinafoate binding or downstream signaling prevented the anticancer effects of salmeterol xinafoate in vivo demonstrating the ontarget action of salmeterol xinafoate on cancer cells and the requirement of the downstream signaling pathway.
finally we showed that treatment with salmeterol xinafoate dosedependently decreased the selfrenewal capacity of lung cancer stem cells breast cancer stem cells and melanoma stem cells.
from the perspective of human evolution into cancer biology our study reveals that β2ar represents an ideal anticancer drug target and that salmeterol xinafoate monotherapy has strong anticancer activity."
"in many bacteria the location of the mrna start codon is determined by a short ribosome binding site sequence that base pairs with the 3′end of 16s ribosomal rna rrna in the 30s subunit.
many groups have changed these short sequences termed the shinedalgarno sd sequence in the mrna and the antishinedalgarno asd sequence in 16s rrna to create orthogonal ribosomes to enable the synthesis of orthogonal polymers in the presence of the endogenous translation machinery.
however orthogonal ribosomes are prone to sdindependent translation.
ribosomal protein bs1 which binds to the 30s ribosomal subunit is thought to promote translation initiation by shuttling mrna to the ribosome.
thus a better understanding of how the sd and bs1 contribute to start codon selection could help efforts to improve the orthogonality of ribosomes.

during homeostasis tγδ17 cell effector identity was stable across tissues including for intestinal tbet tγδ17 cells that restrained ifnγ production.

"many of the biosynthetic pathways for ribosomal synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide ripp natural products make use of multidomain enzymes with separate recruitment and catalysis domains that separately bind and modify peptide substrates.
this division of labor allows ripp enzymes to use relatively open and promiscuous active sites to perform chemistry at multiple residues within a peptide substrate seemingly regardless of the surrounding context.
defining measuring and predicting the seemingly broad substrate promiscuity of ripps necessitates high throughput assays capable of assessing activity against very large libraries of peptides.
using mrna display a high throughput peptide display technology we examine the substrate promiscuity of the ripp cyclodehydratase lynd.
the vast substrate profiling that can be done with mrna display enables the construction of deep learning models for accurate prediction of substrate processing by lynd.
these models further inform on epistatic interactions involved in enzymatic processing.
this work will facilitate the further elucidation of other ripp enzymes and enable their use in the modification of mrna display libraries for selection of modified peptidebased inhibitors and therapeutics"
"the use of social contact rates is widespread in infectious disease modeling since it has been shown that they are key driving forces of important epidemiological parameters.
quantification of contact patterns is crucial to parametrize dynamic transmission models and to provide insights on the basic reproduction number.
information on social interactions can for instance be obtained from populationbased contact surveys such as the european commission project polymod.
estimation of agespecific contact rates from these studies is often done using a piecewise constant approach or bivariate smoothing techniques.
for the latter typically smoothing is done in the dimensions of the respondent’s and contact’s age.
we propose a new flexible strategy based on a smoothing constrained approach  taking into account the reciprocal nature of contacts  where the contact rates are assumed smooth from a cohort perspective as well as from the age distribution of contacts.
this is achieved by smoothing over the diagonal components including all subdiagonals of the social contact matrix.
this approach is supported by the fact that people age with time and thus motivates smoothly varying contact rates from a cohort angle.
two approaches that allow for smoothing of social contact data over cohorts are proposed namely 1 reordering of the diagonal components of the social contact matrix and 2 reordering of the penalty matrix associated with the diagonal components.
parameter estimation is done in the likelihood framework by using constrained penalized iterative reweighted least squares cpirls under poisson and negative binomial distributional assumptions for the observed contacts.
a simulation study underlines the benefits of cohortbased smoothing based on two scalar measures of performance.
finally the proposed methods are illustrated on the belgian polymod data of 2006. code to reproduce the results of the article can be downloaded on this github repository"

"recruitment of faculty members in academic departments shapes the department for decades in both research and teaching arenas.
having a diverse department is beneficial for undergraduate and graduate students as representation of underrepresented minority groups in the professoriate can inspire a greater diversity of students to pursue higher levels of education or researchfocused careers.
increased diversity benefits research directly as diverse teams have been shown to have better ideas and outcomes.
in 2020 our department had lower gender diversity than would be expected based on the pool of phd students and postdoctoral fellows in canada.
therefore we altered our hiring process primarily by redacting applications for recruitment into entrylevel tenuretrack faculty positions.
with this change in process female hires increased from 17 in the previous ten years 5 hires to 80 in the subsequent four years 5 hires with no substantial change in hiring of racially diverse individuals 50 to 40. overall combined with retirements the percentage of female faculty in the department went from 25 to 50 and the percentage of racialized faculty went from 38 to 44. the new hires have met or exceeded expectations of success with respect to grant funding and are on track to meet or exceed expectations for other metrics of success.
thus our intervention was very successful in increasing the diversity of our department within a short timeframe.
we believe that our experience could provide other departments with a template for making substantive change even in the absence of internal expertise in the area."
"environmental stresses such as drought and salt adversely affect plant growth and crop productivity.
while many studies have focused on established components of stress signaling pathways research on unknown elements remains limited.

we analyzed 105 paired rnaseq datasets from resistant or susceptible  cultivars under salt and drought conditions to identify novel stressresponsive genes with common expression changes across these datasets.
a metaanalysis identified 10 genes specifically upregulated in resistant cultivars and 12 specifically upregulated in susceptible cultivars under both drought and salt conditions.
furthermore by comparing previously identified stressresponsive genes in  we explored genes potentially involved in stress response mechanisms that are conserved across plant species.

to accelerate our understanding of biological aging and carry out scalable interventional studies highthroughput approaches are necessary.
we previously introduced a machine visionbased visual frailty index vfi that uses mouse behavior in the open field to assess frailty using c57bl6j b6j data.
aging trajectories are highly genetic and are frequently modeled in genetically diverse animals.
in order to extend the vfi to genetically diverse mouse populations we collect frailty and behavior data on a large cohort of aged diversity outbred do mice.
combined with previous data this represents one of the largest videobased aging behavior datasets to date.
using these data we build accurate predictive models of frailty chronological age and even the proportion of life lived.
the extension of automated and objective frailty assessment tools to genetically diverse mice will enable better modeling of aging mechanisms and enable highthroughput interventional aging studies."
"translocations are central to large carnivore restoration efforts but inadequate monitoring often inhibits effective conservation decisionmaking.
extinctions reintroductions poaching and high inbreeding levels of the central european populations of eurasian lynx lynx lynx typify the carnivore conservation challenges in the anthropocene.
recently several conservation efforts were initiated to improve the genetic and demographic status but were met with variable success.
here we report on a successful stakeholderengaged translocation effort to reinforce the highlyinbred dinaric lynx population and create a new steppingstone subpopulation in the southeastern alps.
we used multidisciplinary and internationallycoordinated monitoring using systematic cameratrapping noninvasive genetic sampling gpstracking of translocated and remnant individuals recording of reproductive events and interspecific interactions as well as the simultaneous tracking of the public and stakeholder support of carnivore conservation before during and after the translocation process across the three countries.
among the 22 translocated wildcaught carpathian lynx 68 successfully integrated into the population and local ecosystems and at least 59 reproduced.
probability of dispersing from the release areas was 3times lower when softrelease rather than hardrelease method was used.
translocated individuals had lower natural mortality higher reproductive success and similar ungulate kill rates compared to the remnant lynx.
cooperation with local hunters and protected area managers enabled us to conduct multiyear cameratrapping and noninvasive genetic monitoring across a 12000km2 transboundary area.
results indicate a reversal in population decline as the lynx abundance increased for 40 during the 4year translocation period.
effective inbreeding decreased from 0.32 to 0.080.19 suggesting a 2 to 4fold increase in fitness.
furthermore successful establishment of a new steppingstone subpopulation represents an important step towards restoring the central european lynx metapopulation.
robust partnerships with local communities and hunters coupled with transparent communication helped maintain high public and stakeholder support for lynx conservation throughout the translocation process.
lessons learned about the importance of stakeholder involvement and multidisciplinary monitoring conducted across several countries provide a successful example for further efforts to restore large carnivores in humandominated ecosystems."

"introduction academic stress can activate physiological changes mediated by the sympathetic nervous system sns and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal hpa axis triggering the release of biomarkers such as cortisol and proinflammatory cytokines.
although physiological stress has been studied in relation to different inducers and diseases there is still a gap regarding the association of academic stress with biological markers.
thus this study aimed to associate the levels of academic stress against biological markers isolated from saliva from undergraduates students.
materials and methods 81 students 53 women and 28 men were recruited and completed the sisco inventory to determine the level of academic stress.
the levels of cortisol interleukin–1β il–1β creactive protein crp and immunoglobulin a iga from saliva samples were determined by elisa assays and data were analyzed using anova pearson correlation tests.
a predictor model was estimated by lineal regression.
results stress categorization following the sisco inventory showed that 37 of the students grouped in the low stress level 48 35 grouped in the moderate stress level 49 60 and 28 in high stress level 61 100. the levels of salivary markers were similar across stress categories however the trends identified–such as the decrease in cortisol and the increase in pro–inflammatory markers in male participants categorized in the high stress group–suggest a possible association between these biomarkers with academic stress gender–dependent.
the multivariable model including the 4 biomarkers resulted in r2  0.14 with predictions that were roughly within ± 20 of stress levels.
conclusion this research suggests a possible association between academic stress and salivary biomarkers and proposes a predictive tool for stress levels in college students.
further research will consider individual factors longitudinal assessments and the use of multiple psychometric tools to better define the interaction between academic stress and salivary biomarkers."
"with the increased use of prescribed burns in recent years it is critical to understand their impacts not only on their primary target species but also on the entire biological community.
lichen have intricate symbioses with other neighboring organisms and provide important ecosystem services.
in prairie and grassland environments the prescribed burns may result in the extirpation of some grounddwelling species of lichen.
however the impacts of fire schedules on the lichen recovery in florida scrub remains unknown.
the dry sandy scrub ecosystem houses the only federally endangered lichen in the state the florida perforate lichen cladonia perforata.
as scrub communities are adapted to the presence of fire prescribed burns are now a routine management practice.
lichen has a key role in early plant succession following fire influencing the health of florida scrub.
we used a modified feests method to survey the effects of fire regime on terrestrial lichen abundance and diversity in the lakeland highlands scrub an area of scrub habitat in polk county in central florida.
the speed and comparable accuracy of feests method render it an accessible means of assessing biodiversity for land management in protected areas.
we estimated percent cover of lichen and estimated species diversity using the lichen diversity value ldv in four areas of scrub and scrubby flatwoods habitat with different burn histories unburned two years eight years and ten years since last burn.
according to the ldv calculations diversity is highest in the most extreme temporal groups contradicting our initial prediction that lichen diversity and abundance would be greatest in the intermediately disturbed areas two and eight years post burn.
these preliminary data suggest implementing prescribed burns more frequently in this scrub habitat would allow lichen communities a greater opportunity to recover.
our study yields beneficial information to assist future decisions made regarding the frequency of fire regimes within the florida scrublands habitat.
methods of protecting lichen may also be recommended such as collecting and removing lichen prior to a burn and returning those lichen samples to the area after e.g.
remove and return."
"standard methods for differential expression and differential abundance analysis rely on normalization to address sampletosample variation in sequencing depth.
however normalizations imply strict unrealistic assumptions about the unmeasured scale of biological systems e.g.
microbial load or total cellular transcription.
this introduces bias that can lead to false positives and false negatives.
to overcome these limitations we suggest replacing normalizations with interval assumptions.
this approach allows researchers to explicitly define plausible lower and upper bounds on the unmeasured biological systems scale making these assumptions more realistic transparent and flexible than those imposed by traditional normalizations.
compared to recent alternatives like scale models and sensitivity analyses interval assumptions are easier to use resulting in potentially reduced false positives and false negatives and have stronger guarantees of typei error control.
we make interval assumptions accessible by introducing a modified version of aldex2 as a publicly available software package.
through simulations and real data studies we show these methods can reduce false positives and false negatives compared to normalizationbased tools."

the flow of args into and between pathogens however remains poorly understood limiting our ability to develop strategies for managing the antibiotic resistance crisis.
therefore we aimed to identify genetic and ecological factors that are fundamental for successful horizontal arg transfer.
from the analysis of 1 million bacterial genomes and 20000 metagenomes we developed random forest models that could reliably predict horizontal arg transfer between bacteria.
our results suggest that genetic incompatibility measured as nucleotide composition dissimilarity negatively influences the likelihood of transfer of args between evolutionarily divergent bacteria.
conversely environmental cooccurrence increased the likelihood especially in humans and wastewater in which several environmentspecific dissemination patterns were observed.
this study provides new ways to predict the spread of args and provides new insights into the mechanisms governing this evolutionary process."
"study question does the inhibition of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr alter cervical mucus produced by endocervical cells in vitro
summary answer inhibition of cftr dehydrates and thickens in vitro endocervical secretions.
what is known already cervical mucus changes throughout the menstrual cycle in response to hormonal fluctuations helping to regulate fertility and access of pathogens to the reproductive tract.
cftr is an anion channel that plays a critical role in mediating epithelial mucus secretions.
study design size duration  in vitro experiments conducted with control and experimental arms.
participantsmaterials setting methods primary endocervical cells obtained from rhesus macaques macaca mulatta were treated with vehicle controls or cftr inhibitor inh172.
hydration and viscosity of secreted mucus was measured through air surface liquid and particle tracking microrheology.
main results and the role of chance endocervical cells treated with cftr inhibitor inh172 demonstrated dehydrated thicker mucus secretions compared to control p.01.
limitations reasons for caution in vitro models do not fully recapitulate cellular mucus secretions.
wider implications of the findings cervical mucus plays an important role in fertility regulation.
our studies suggest that cftr may be an important mediator of those changes and provide experimental evidence for the infertility phenotype seen in women with cystic fibrosis.
additionally assays used in these studies are useful endpoints for studying cervical mucus regulation in vitro."
"fertilization delays of nearly a year have been observed in many acornproducing fagaceae trees.
despite this longstanding recognition the underlying mechanisms and adaptive significance of delayed fertilization remain largely unexplored.
it has been hypothesized that these prolonged delays may serve as an adaptive strategy allowing ovules to be fertilized and seeds to develop during more favorable seasons thereby avoiding the adverse conditions of winter.
however empirical evidence to support this hypothesis is still lacking.
to test the overwintering hypothesis we observed the seasonal progression of pollen tube growth and ovule development in lithocarpus edulis a species exhibiting two flowering seasons spring and autumn.
we conducted monthly observations of pollen tube growth and ovule development in both spring and autumn flower samples.
we employed microtome techniques and scanning confocal microscopy to closely examine the seasonal progression of pollen tube growth and ovule development.
we found that pollen tubes were arrested at the stylejoining site and ovules remained immature in both spring and autumn samples prior to winter.
following winter pollen tube regrowth and ovule maturation were synchronized in the subsequent spring in both spring and autumn samples.
our results support the overwintering hypothesis suggesting that delayed fertilization may serve as an adaptive strategy to ensure fertilization in spring overcoming the reproductive challenges posed by cold winter conditions.
our study introduces a new avenue for studying the temporal organization of plant reproductive phenology specifically the alignment of flowering pollination fertilization and fruiting in seasonal environments."
"antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest threats against human health and the misuse and overuse of antibiotics is a key factor driving resistance development.
during prolonged antibiotic treatment of chronic infections the antimicrobial pressure facilitates selection of antibiotic resistance mutations.

furthermore antibiotic tolerant persister cells may be a reservoir for resistance development so targeting persister cells with antipersister drugs could also reduce the emergence of resistance."
"the intensity and duration of biological signals encode information that allows a few pathways to regulate a wide array of cellular behaviors.
despite the central importance of signaling in biomedical research our ability to quantify it in individual cells over time remains limited.

by regulating a crispr base editor inscribe generates mutations in genomic target sequences at a rate proportional to signaling activity.
the number of edits is then recovered through a novel ratiometric readout strategy from images of two fluorescence channels.
we engineered human cell lines for recording wnt and bmp pathway activity and demonstrated that inscribe faithfully recovers both the intensity and duration of signaling.
further we used inscribe to study the variability of cellular response to wnt and bmp stimulation and test whether the magnitude of response is a stable heritable trait.
we found a persistent memory in the bmp pathway.
progeny of cells with higher bmp response levels are likely to respond more strongly to a second bmp stimulation up to 3 weeks later.
together our results establish a scalable platform for genetic recording and  readout of signaling history in single cells advancing quantitative analysis of cellcell communication during development and disease."
"aphids often overcome host plant resistance by developing virulence.
however the underlying mechanisms and the precise modifications involved remain poorly understood.
additionally the molecular response of resistant host plants during compatible virulent aphid and incompatible avirulent aphid interactions is another area requiring further investigation.
here diuraphis noxia russian wheat aphid biotypes of varying virulence were transferred from susceptible triticum aestivum to a nearisogenic line containing the dn7 resistance gene.
transcriptomes of the d. noxia biotypes and the resistant host were sequenced before and after the host shift.
transcriptomic analysis indicated that the d. noxia biotypes had unique responses which were involved in detoxification e.g.
lxylulose reductase membrane transport e.g.
tert1 and epigenetic regulation.
in addition many transposable elements were rapidly differentially regulated between biotypes and because of the host shift.
in the host plant all biotypes induced jasmonic acid signalling and terpenoid biosynthesis.
however the mono and diterpenoid pathways were only upregulated following feeding by the biotypes avirulent to dn7 and not samv2.
rapid differential expression of transposons suggests a mechanism of adaptation for clonally reproducing aphids.
furthermore samv2 may possess mechanisms to modulate the defence response of dn7containing t. aestivum."
"many immunotherapies focus on reinvigorating cd8 t cell anticancer responses and different nuclear imaging techniques have been developed to measure cd8 t cell distributions.
in vivo labeling approaches using radiotracers primarily show cd8 t cell distributions while ex vivo labeled cd8 t cells can show cd8 t cell migration patterns homing and tumor infiltration.
currently a comprehensive headtohead comparison of in vivo and ex vivo cell labeling with respect to their tumor and normal tissue targeting properties and correlation to the presence of cd8 t cells is lacking yet essential for correct interpretation of clinical cd8 imaging applications.
therefore we performed a headtohead comparison of three different cd8 t cell imaging approaches 1 zrlabeled dfoconjugated fcsilent anticd8 antibody zrzranticd8igg2a 2 ex vivo zroxine labeled ovalbuminspecific cd8 t cells zrzroti cells and 3 flabeled il2 falfrescail2.
methods
b16f10ova tumorbearing c57bl6 mice n10group received intravenously one of the three radiopharmaceuticals.
petct images were acquired starting 72 h zrzranticd8igg2a 24 and 48 h zrzroti cells and 10 min falfrescail2 post injection.
subsequently ex vivo biodistribution analysis of the radiopharmaceuticals was performed followed by flow cytometric analysis to evaluate the number of intratumoral cd8 t cells.
additionally the intratumoral radiolabel distributions was assessed by autoradiography and immunohistochemistry ihc on tumor slices.
results
zrzranticd8igg2a zrzroti cells and falfrescail2 showed uptake in cd8rich tissues with preferential targeting to the spleen.
biodistribution analysis showed tumor uptake above blood level for all radiopharmaceuticals except falfrescail2.
for all three approaches the uptake in the tumordraining lymph node was significantly higher compared with the contralateral axial lymph node suggesting that all approaches allow evaluation of immune responses involving cd8 t cells.
tumor uptake of zrzranticd8igg2a r0.65 p0.01 and zrzroti cells r0.74 p0.01 correlated to the number of intratumoral cd8 t cells flow cytometry.
the intratumoral distribution pattern of the radiosignal was different for ex vivo and in vivo radiolabeling techniques.
the short halflife of f precluded autoradiography assessment of falfrescail2.
conclusion
we show that zrzranticd8igg2a and zrzroti cells petct imaging can be used to evaluate intratumoral cd8 t cells even though their normal tissues and intratumoral distribution patterns are significantly different.
based on their characteristics zrzranticd8igg2a might be most useful to immunophenotyping the tme while the ex vivo cell labeling approach visualizes cd8 t cell migrations patterns and the permissiveness of tumors for invasion whereas falfrescail2 allows for rapid recurrent imaging and might prove useful for tracking rapid changes in cd8 t cell distributions.
in conclusion our headtohead comparison of the three prototype cd8 t cell labeling approaches provides new insights which can aid in correct interpretation of clinical cd8 imaging and may guide in the selection of the optimal imaging approach for the research question of interest."

"this study presents the development of a simple dna extraction method and a novel pcrrflp protocol for genotyping the   gene in  as a proof of concept.
traditional ctabbased dna extraction methods while effective involve hazardous chemicals and require highspeed centrifugation which are impractical in many field settings.
our approach utilizes a household dish detergentbased buffer sodium chloride and polyvinylpyrrolidone k30 to extract dna from  needle leaf tissues—without the need for liquid nitrogen.
the simplicity of this method makes it more accessible and environmentally friendly.
the extracted dna was successfully used in pcrrflp analysis targeting a single nucleotide polymorphism in the  gene demonstrating its efficacy for genotyping.
the pcrrflp markers reliably discriminated between individual genotypes confirming the practical application of our simple extraction method even for conifers containing inhibitory substances.
this technique is particularly advantageous for use in arboretums and field stations where the use of hazardous chemicals specialized equipment and a draft chamber is limited.
our study contributes to genetic resource management by providing an easy reliable and safer method for dna extraction and genetic analysis."
"epithelial tissues are traditionally considered immobile requiring epithelialtomesenchymal transition emt for individual or collective cell migration as mesenchymal cells.
however recent studies indicate that the mammary epithelium migrates via mechanisms distinct from mesenchymal collectives.
here we demonstrate that mammary epithelium does not undergo emt before migration as evidenced by cellular and molecular characteristics including emt marker expression at the mrna protein localization and transcriptomic levels.
contrary to established models cellcell adhesion is not diminished but is required for epithelial migration.
furthermore snail1 does not repress cellcell adhesion but instead plays a pivotal role in directing epithelial migration by regulating processes such as the directional movement of individual cells via cdc42ep5.
our findings reveal the existence of both stationary and migratory states within the epithelium providing new insights into how epithelial tissues transition between these states with broad implications for organogenesis and cancer biology."
"patientderived organoids pdos offer new opportunities to model various cancers.
however their application in prostate cancer pca has been hampered by poor success rates and overgrowth of cell types which are not representative of the patient samples.
by exploiting a cohort of 164 pca patient samples and tuning several culture parameters we show that an extracellular matrixfree ecmfree culture system increases the takerate of pdos with luminallike and pca features.
singlecell rna sequencing scrnaseq reveals that ecmfree pdos comprise cell populations associated with known pca signatures and exhibit transcriptomic resemblance with their respective parental tumors.
in addition we define organoidassociated cell type signatures and identify markers discriminating tumors versus benign cells ex vivo and in situ.
furthermore we generate the first prostate pdo singlecell atlas integrating previouslypublished scrnaseq datasets and our newlygenerated data.
we show that matrigelbased organoid cultures derived from primary pca are essentially composed of benignlike epithelial cells irrespective of the dataset or the malignant nature of the tissue of origin.
in contrast ecmfree conditions maintain heterogenous patientspecific luminal tumor cell populations and enrich in intermediate cell types.

"the rna degradosome a multiprotein complex regulating mrna in bacteria assembles on the rnase e cterminal domain ctd in pseudomonadota proteobacteria via short linear motifs slims.
the composition of the pseudomonas aeruginosa rna degradosome is largely unknown and its rnase e ctd shows limited similarity to those in models like escherichia coli or caulobacter crescentus.
our study characterizes the function of conserved slims in p. aeruginosa rnase e including a duplicated sequence termed the reerrepeats region.
this region along with ar1 and ar4 slims mediates rna binding and localizes the degradosome in subcellular foci.
pulldown and bacterial twohybrid assays identified pnpase and rhlb as interacting proteins with direct interactions confirmed via protein binding assays.
the ndpr and ar1 slims mediate these interactions respectively.
transcriptome analyses and phenotypic assays of rnase e ctd mutants revealed growth defects in specific conditions and virulence defects revealing the importance of rnase e ctd rna binding and rna degradosome scaffolding for p. aeruginosa adaptability."
"the biosynthesis of camp by mammalian membranebound adenylyl cyclases macs is predominantly regulated by gproteincoupledreceptors gpcrs.
up to now the two hexahelical transmembrane domains of macs were considered to fix the enzyme to membranes.
here we show that the transmembrane domains serve in addition as signal receptors and transmitters of lipid signals that control gsalphastimulated mac activities.
we identify aliphatic fatty acids and anandamide as receptor ligands of mac isoforms 1 to 7 and 9. the ligands enhance mac isoforms 2 3 7 and 9 or attenuate isoforms 1 4 5 and 6 gsalphastimulated mac activities in vitro and in vivo.
substitution of the stimulatory membrane receptor of mac3 by the inhibitory receptor of mac5 results in a ligand inhibited mac5mac3 chimera.
thus we discovered a new class of membrane receptors in which two signaling modalities are at a crossing direct tonic lipid and indirect phasic gpcrgsalpha signaling regulating the biosynthesis of camp."
"epistasis can profoundly influence evolutionary dynamics.
temporal genetic data consisting of sequences sampled repeatedly from a population over time provides a unique resource to understand how epistasis shapes evolution.
however detecting epistatic interactions from sequence data is technically challenging.
existing methods for identifying epistasis are computationally demanding limiting their applicability to realworld data.
here we present a novel computational method for inferring epistasis that significantly reduces computational costs without sacrificing accuracy.
we validated our approach in simulations and applied it to study hiv1 evolution over multiple years in a data set of 16 individuals.
there we observed a strong excess of negative epistatic interactions between beneficial mutations especially mutations involved in immune escape.
our method is general and could be used to characterize epistasis in other large data sets."

"the utilization of unconventional feed resources such as water hyacinth is an effective strategy to address feed shortages in tropical and subtropical regions particularly where access to conventional feeds is limited.
in this study tropical sheep doyogena rams and goats woyitoguji bucks fed diets containing different amounts of wh were examined for their zootechnical performance and profitability sing a 2 × 4 × 4 randomized crossover design with two animal species four nutritional treatments and four feeding intervals.
the dietary treatments consisted of 50 hay  0 wh  50 commercial concentrate cc t1 50 hay  12.5 wh  37.5 cc t2 50 hay  25 wh  25 cc t3 and 50 hay  37.5 wh  12.5 cc t4.
the findings showed that compared to goats sheep had the highest energy and nutrient intake p0.001 nutrient digestibility p0.001 average daily gain adg gday and body weight change bwc kg p0.05.
regarding energy and nutritional intake there was a substantial difference p  0.001 between treatment groups for both animal species with the exception of goats’ consumption of dm om cho ge and adl p 0.05. likewise significant differences existed between treatment groups for nutritional digestibility adg bwc and fce for both species p 0.001. moreover significant interactions p  0.005 were seen in all energy and nutrient intake parameters between species and treatment.
furthermore in tropical sheep and goat breeds water hyacinth can replace up to 37.5 of the commercial concentrate used for growth and fattening but it has a major comparative effect on sheep.
feed prices for the t4 group fed sheep and goats were 37.2 and 36.8 lower respectively than for the t1 group.
therefore farmers in the tropics who cannot afford commercial concentrates can still benefit economically by using the dry biomass of water hyacinth in their diet either with or without it."
"background recombinant protein production in escherichia coli e. coli is a widely used system in both academic and industrial research owing to its low cost and wide availability of genetic tools.
despite its advantages this system still struggles with soluble expression of recombinant proteins.
to address this various solubilityenhancing and yieldimproving methods such as the addition of fusion tags have been developed.
however traditional tags such as small ubiquitinrelated modifier sumo and glutathione stransferase gst can interfere with protein folding or require removal posttranslation which adds complexity and cost to production.
to circumvent these issues smaller solubility tags 10 kda are preferred.
this study specifically focuses on an 11amino acid solubilityenhancing tag nt11 derived from the nterminal domain of a duplicated carbonic anhydrase from dunaliella species.
results a comprehensive analysis was performed to improve the characteristics of the 11amino acid tag.
by investigating the alaninescan library of nt11 we increased its activity and identified key residues for further development.
screening with the alanine mutant library consistently led to at least a twofold improvement in protein yield for three different proteins.
we also discovered that the nt11 tag is not limited to the nterminal position and can function at either the n or cterminal of the protein providing flexibility in designing protein expression constructs.
with these new insights we have successfully doubled the recombinant protein yields of valuable growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor 2 fgf2 and an originally lowyielding human epidermal growth factor hegf in e. coli.
conclusion the further characterisation and development of the nt11 tag have provided valuable insights into the optimization process for such small tags and expanded our understanding of its potential applications.
the ability of nt11 tag to be positioned at different locations within the protein construct without compromising its effectiveness to enhance recombinant protein yields makes it a valuable tool across a diverse range of proteins.

aphids are one of the biggest group of ectotherms that transmit viruses to plants more than 200 species have been identified as pathogen vectors.
these aphids are responsible for transmitting over 300 viruses.
the lifehistory traits of aphids such as fecundity and survival respond strongly and nonlinearly to temperature and therefore to global warming.
in this study we elaborate the thermal responses for the main lifehistory traits i.e development and mortality rate for aphid species for which data were available or generated.
also thermal responses for virus transmission rates were elaborated to describe plant host to vector and vector to plant host dynamics.
with these data we elaborated thermal suitability models which were used to map current and projected scenarios for the transmission of viruses by aphids.

"under conditions of oxidative stress or iron starvation ironsulfur cluster biogenesis in  is initiated by the cysteine desulfurase sufs via the suf pathway.
sufs is a type ii cysteine desulfurase that catalyzes the plpdependent breakage of an lcysteine cs bond to generate lalanine and a covalent active site persulfide as products.
the persulfide is transferred from sufs to sufe and then to the sufbc2d complex which utilizes it in ironsulfur cluster biogenesis.
several lines of evidence suggest two conserved arginine residues that line the solvent side of the sufs active site could be important for function.
to investigate the mechanistic roles of r56 and r359 the residues were substituted using sitedirected mutagenesis to obtain r56ak and r359ak sufs variants.
steady state kinetics indicated r56 and r359 have moderate defects in the desulfurase half reaction but major defects in the transpersulfurase step.
fluorescence polarization binding assays showed that the loss of activity was not due to a defect in forming the sufssufe complex.
structural characterization of r56a sufs shows loss of electron density for the α3α4 loop at the r56g57 positions consistent with a requirement of r56 for proper loop conformation.
the structure of r359a sufs exhibits a conformational change in the α3α4 loop allowing r56 to enter the active site and mimics the residues position in the plpcysteine aldimine structure.
taken together the kinetic binding and structural data support a mechanism where r359 plays a role in linking sufs catalysis with modulation of the α3α4 loop to promote a closeapproach interaction of sufs and sufe conducive to persulfide transfer."
"microsporidia have long been proposed as biological agents for controlling disease vectors and the parasites they transmit.
however their study in vector biology has been constrained due to challenges in manipulating microsporidia within hosts.
in this study we investigated the effect of dexrazoxane a candidate drug against microsporidiosis on the establishment and development of  infection in its natural host the mosquito  the main malaria vector.
our findings show that dexrazoxane significantly reduces spore load particularly in mosquitoes reared individually without affecting the overall infection success of the parasite.
this result aligns with studies in  where dexrazoxane inhibited new spore production without hindering initial spore integration into the host gut cells.
dexrazoxanes dna topoisomerase ii inhibitor mechanism likely explains its impact on mosquito development as larvae exposed to the drug failed to emerge as adults.
these findings highlight dexrazoxanes potential as a viable tool for controlling microsporidia in adult mosquitoes and hope to enhance the study of mosquitomicrosporidia interactions.
further research is required to explore its broader application in vectorborne disease control including malaria."
"mixedlineage leukemia mll protein is a well characterized epigenetic regulator whose noncanonical activities remain under appreciated.
here we show that mll and its associated protein wdr5 localize to the midbody.
loss of mllwdr5 results in defective midbody formation which displays a wide midzonelike microtubule structure along with chromosome bridges resulting in binucleated cells.
we show that mll and wdr5 interact with kinesin 13 motor kif2c and targets it to the midbody.
the depolymerase activity of kif2c promotes correct localization of centralspindlin complex compaction of midzone mts and finally furrow completion.
by characterizing the previously undiscovered role of mll and kif2c in the regulation of cytokinesis our work underscores the importance of these proteins at the interface of actin and microtubule cytoskeleton regulation pathways that are frequently altered in oncogenesis."

cancer drug sensitivity studies can predict the response levels of different drugs for the same cultured cancer cell line which is beneficial for personalized medicine.
recent studies have demonstrated that integrating multimodal genomic data e.g.

although multimodal genomic profiles are generally available from public datasets only gene expression data is commonly used in clinical settings.
in this study we propose a framework for privileged information knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from a multimodal genomic teacher network using only gene expression for inference.
specifically we train a teacher network by feature reweighting based on intermodality dependencies and align the intersample correlations through our proposed relationaware differentiation distillation.
experiments on the genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer gdsc dataset demonstrate that our framework improves drug response prediction by about 6 compared to the baseline and outperforms stateoftheart methods.
transferable studies performed on missing gdsc data and clinical datasets further confirm the feasibility of our model for predicting drug responses using only gene expression data."
"in many terrestrial insects the onset of metamorphosis marks a transition from humid to dry environments.
yet how metamorphosing insect pupae protect themselves against the threat of dehydration remains unclear.

this barrier comprises unisex hyperlong hydrocarbons 2937 carbons in length which are synthesized by larval oenocytes and stored in the larval fat body before being deployed on the pupal and young adult cuticles.
we show that the fatty acid elongase  is required for the biosynthesis of hyperlong hydrocarbons that are essential for the barrier to water loss during metamorphosis.
across the  genus many species express unisex profiles of hyperlong hydrocarbons and as young adults transition to sexspecific shorter hydrocarbons with known pheromonal functions.

caloric intake was correlated with fecal microbiota diversity.
bayesian inference revealed associations between intake of sweets or sugars during antibiotic exposure with microbiome disruption as assessed by low diversity or expansion of the pathobiont enterococcus.
we validated this observation experimentally finding that sucrose exacerbated antibioticinduced enterococcus expansion in mice.

"biomaterial coatings and films can prevent premature failure and enhance performance of chronically implanted medical devices.
however current hydrophilic polymer coatings and films have significant drawbacks including swelling and delamination.
to address these issues we modified hydroxyethyl cellulose with thioether groups to generate an oxidationresponsive polymer hecmtp.
hecmtp readily dissolves in green solvents and can be fabricated as coatings or films with tunable thicknesses.
hecmtp coatings effectively scavenge hydrogen peroxide resulting in conversion of thioether groups to sulfoxide groups on the polymer chain.
oxidationdriven hydrophobictohydrophilic transitions that are isolated to the surface of hecmtp coatings under physiologically relevant conditions increase wettability decrease stiffness and reduce protein adsorption to generate a nonfouling interface with minimal coating delamination or swelling.
hecmtp can be used in diverse optical applications and permits oxidationresponsive controlled drug release.
hecmtp films are nonresorbable in vivo and evoke minimal foreign body responses.
these results highlight the versatility of hecmtp and support its incorporation into chronically implanted medical devices."
"in many multicellular organisms sexual development is not determined by xxxy or zwzz systems but by uv sex chromosomes.
in uv systems sex determination occurs in the haploid phase with u chromosomes in females and v chromosomes in males.
here we explore several male female and partially sexreversed male lines of giant kelp to decipher how uv sex chromosomes and autosomes initiate male versus female development.
we identify a key set of genes on the sex chromosomes involved in triggering sexual development and characterise autosomal effector genes underlying sexual differentiation.
we show that male but not female development involves largescale transcriptome reorganisation with pervasive enrichment in regulatory genes faster evolutionary rates and high species specificity of malebiased genes.
our observations imply that a femalelike phenotype is the ground state which is complemented by the presence of a uchromosome but overridden by a dominant male developmental program in the presence of a vchromosome."

we observed distinct clusters of noncanonical secretion and intracellular thermal proteome profiling linked dysregulated mechanisms to extracellular markers.
functional followup confirmed lysosomal alterations by cationicamphiphilic drugs connected damage of the respiratory chain to rab7dependent secretion of mitochondrial proteins and linked druginduced endoplasmic reticulum stress to reduced basal secretion.

"magnetic resonance elastography mrebased muscle force estimation methods have been proposed to estimate individual muscle forces based on measurements of shear wave speed and joint torque in multiple postures.
to estimate both the slope and offset parameters of the relationship between shear wave speed and muscle force it is necessary to collect measurements in a plethora of postures in case of substantial muscle redundancy.
however anisotropic mre requires a structural and diffusiontensor imaging scan in each posture which is infeasible given the time constraints of mri imaging.
the objectives of this work were to develop a muscle force estimator with sufficient accuracy that would only require a limited set of postures and to evaluate its effectiveness under a variety of measurement conditions.
we developed a novel mrebased muscle force estimator which decouples shear wave speed into its active and passive components and solves for the slope and offset parameters independently.
we assessed the effectiveness of the proposed estimator under different simulated measurement conditions with varying levels of noise and compared it to the original mrebased estimator.
the proposed estimator results in a reduction in the estimation error for the offset parameter for all muscles without significant degradation in the estimation error for the slope parameter.
however the proposed muscle force estimator does not improve the goodnessoffit or the crossvalidation error compared to the original estimator.
in conclusion the proposed mrebased muscle force estimator improves the estimation of musclespecific parameters and may yield increased muscle force estimation performance."
"glucose sensing and monitoring are crucial for biological and medical applications.
compared to existing methods realtime detection and longterm monitoring are still required.
singlewalled carbon nanotubes swcnts have excellent optical properties for sensing applications which provide the possibility for designing a new generation of glucose sensors.

the functional groups are introduced by a photocatalytic reaction which acts as the handle for protein loading on swcnts.
in this sp3 defect reaction the optical properties of swcnts can be maintained.
with a convenient bioconjugation reaction the gox could be covalently linked with swcnts.
compared to the noncovalent immobilization conjugates the covalent conjugate sensor exhibits a much stronger optical response toward glucose and the stability of the biosensor also increases in harsh conditions.
at the same time we also report the changing ratio of the original e and defected e peak during the bioconjugation reaction which is also inspiring for reaction monitoring on swcnts."

to simplify and reduce the costs of such largescale surveys we implemented a highthroughput microfluidic realtime pcr system suitable for the screening of the main bacterial and parasitic genera involved in tickborne disease and potentially circulating in the area.
we used the new screening tool to perform an exploratory epidemiological study on 132 specimens of  and 446 of  collected in guadeloupe and martinique.
not only the system was able to detect the main pathogens of the area–     – but the system also provided evidence of unsuspected microorganisms in caribbean ticks belonging to the    and  genera.

"neutrophils have tumorpromoting roles in breast cancer and are detected in higher numbers in aggressive breast tumors.
how aggressive breast tumors recruit neutrophils remains undefined.
here we investigated the roles of tgfβ1 and tnfα in the regulation of neutrophil recruitment by breast cancer cells.
tgfβ1 and tnfα are proinflammatory factors upregulated in breast tumors and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transitions emt a process linked to cancer cell aggressiveness.
we report that as expected dual treatment with tgfβ1 and tnfα induces emt signatures in premalignant m2 cells which are part of the mcf10a breast cancer progression model.
conditioned media cm harvested from m2 cells treated with tgfβ1tnfα gives rise to amplified neutrophil chemotaxis compared to cm from control m2 cells.
this response correlates with higher levels of the neutrophil chemokines cxcl1 cxcl2 and cxcl8 and is significantly attenuated in the presence of a cxcl8neutralizing antibody.
furthermore we found that secretion of cxcl1 and cxcl8 from treated m2 cells depends on p38mapk activity.
by combining gene editing immunological and biochemical approaches we show that the regulation of neutrophil recruitment and emt signatures are not mechanistically linked in treated m2 cells.
finally analysis of publicly available cancer cell line transcriptomic databases revealed a significant correlation between cxcl8 and tgfβ1tnfαregulated or effector genes in breast cancer.

the relevance of these pathways to the development of inflammatory disorders in humans remains unknown.
we hypothesized that a comprehensive examination of the ansimmune network in patients with hiv would reveal that the type and severity of autonomic neuropathy an would predict immune phenotypes with distinct clinical and demographic characteristics.
methods this is a crosssectional study of 79 adult people with a history of wellcontrolled hiv on stable combination antiretroviral treatment cart recruited from a primary care clinic network within the mount sinai health system in new york city.
all participants underwent a standardized battery of autonomic function tests summarized as the composite autonomic severity score cass and vagal and adrenergic baroreflex sensitivity brsv and brsa.

"regarding to the impact of ancestral sarscov2 immune imprinting on antibody responses to emerging variants to what extent memory b cells elicited by wildtype wt spike can develop neutralizing breadth and potency in immune recalls is a key question.
here we longitudinally tracked b cells recognizing wt spike in two individuals of mrna vaccine from convalescence of breakthrough infection to acute phase of reinfection.
comprehensive characterization of 632 monoclonal antibodies mabs from those b cells reveals that mabs cloned after reinfection have dramatically enhanced neutralizing breadth and potency including 11 mabs that potently neutralize all tested sarscov2 variants from wt to kp.3.
among the 11 mabs 5 mabs are classified into public clonotypes encoded by ighv353 or ighv366 whereas the rest belong to a rarely reported clonotype encoded by ighv374.
notably ighv374 mabs can neutralize sarscov1 with a minimum ic50 of 0.055 μgml.
structural and functional analysis further suggests that ighv374 mabs target a novel epitope on receptorbinding domain and the best mab termed kxd352 is highly resilient to variations on this epitope.
overall this study demonstrates that both public and rare antibody clonotypes primed by prototype mrna vaccine can achieve extraordinary neutralizing breadth and potency in repeated omicron infections."
"in many bacteria the location of the mrna start codon is determined by a short ribosome binding site sequence that base pairs with the 3′end of 16s ribosomal rna rrna in the 30s subunit.
many groups have changed these short sequences termed the shinedalgarno sd sequence in the mrna and the antishinedalgarno asd sequence in 16s rrna to create “orthogonal” ribosomes to enable the synthesis of orthogonal polymers in the presence of the endogenous translation machinery.
however orthogonal ribosomes are prone to sdindependent translation.
ribosomal protein bs1 which binds to the 30s ribosomal subunit is thought to promote translation initiation by shuttling mrna to the ribosome.
thus a better understanding of how the sd and bs1 contribute to start codon selection could help efforts to improve the orthogonality of ribosomes.
here we engineered the  ribosome to prevent binding of bs1 to the 30s subunit to separate the activity of bs1 binding to the ribosome from the role of the mrna sd sequence in start codon selection.

"the rasmapk system plays an important role in regulating various cellular processes including growth differentiation apoptosis and transformation.
dysregulation of this system has been implicated in genetic diseases and cancers affecting diverse tissues.
to better understand the regulation of this system we employed information flow analysis based on transfer entropy te between the activation dynamics of two key elements in cells stimulated with egf sos a guanine nucleotide exchanger for the small gtpase ras and raf a ras effector serinethreonine kinase.
te analysis allows for modelfree assessment of the timing direction and strength of the information flow regulating the system response.
we detected significant amounts of te in both directions between sos and raf indicating feedback regulation.
importantly the amount of te did not simply follow the input dose or the intensity of the causal reaction demonstrating the uniqueness of te.
te analysis proposed regulatory networks containing multiple tracks and feedback loops and revealed temporal switching in the reaction pathway primarily responsible for reaction control.
this proposal was confirmed by the effects of a mek inhibitor on te.

to better understand the mechanism of viral rna mutagenesis it is crucial to elucidate the role of rdrp in replicating across oxidative lesions.
in this study we investigated the rna synthesis catalyzed by the reconstituted sarscov2 rdrp past a single 8oxorg.
the rdrpmediated primer extension was significantly inhibited by 8oxorg on the template rna.
during the blockage of the extension reaction the rate of product release by rdrp was extremely slow indicating that the rdrp machinery remained bound to the replicating primertemplate rna.
once rdrp was able to bypass 8oxorg it preferentially incorporated rcmp with a lesser amount of ramp opposite 8oxorg.
in contrast rdrp demonstrated greater activity in extending from the mutagenic ra8oxorg terminus compared to the lower efficiency of extension from the rc8oxorg pair.
based on steadystate kinetic analyses for the incorporation of rnmps opposite 8oxorg and chain extension from rc8oxorg or ra8oxorg the relative bypass frequency for ra8oxorg was found to be sevenfold higher than that for rc8oxorg.
therefore the properties of rdrp indicated in this study may contribute to the mechanism of mutagenesis of the sarscov2 genome."

pathogens experience selection on traits at multiple scales including replication rates within host individuals and transmissibility between hosts.
we analyze a stochastic model linking pathogen growth and competition within individuals to transmission between individuals.
our analysis reveals a new factor the crossscale reproductive number of a mutant virion that quantifies how quickly mutant strains increase in frequency when they initially appear in the infected host population.
this crossscale reproductive number combines with viral mutation rates singlestrain reproductive numbers and transmission bottleneck width to determine the likelihood of evolutionary emergence and whether evolution occurs swiftly or gradually within chains of transmission.
we find that wider transmission bottlenecks facilitate emergence of pathogens with shortterm infections but hinder emergence of pathogens exhibiting crossscale selective conflict and longterm infections.
our results provide a framework to advance the integration of laboratory clinical and field data in the context of evolutionary theory laying the foundation for a new generation of evidencebased risk assessment of emergence threats."

"proteasome activator 28γ pa28γ plays a critical role in malignant progression of various tumors however its role and regulation are not well understood.
here using oral squamous cell carcinoma oscc as main research model we discovered that pa28γ interacted with complement 1q binding protein c1qbp which is dependent on the nterminus of c1qbp rather than the known functional domain amino acids 168213. notably we found that pa28γ can enhance c1qbp protein stability in oscc.
functionally pa28γ contributes to the malignant progression of oscc by affecting mitochondrial morphology and oxidative phosphorylation oxphos through c1qbp in vitro and vivo.
mechanically pa28γ upregulate the expression of optic atrophy 1 opa1 mitofusin 2 mfn1 mitofusin 2 mfn2 and the mitochondrial respiratory complex by c1qbp.
moreover in a clinical cohort of oscc patients pa28γ was positively correlated with c1qbp expression and negatively correlated with prognosis.
therefore c1qbp is also a potential target for the treatment and prognosis of cancer."

"tn7 family transposons are mobile genetic elements known for precise target site selection with some coopting crisprcas systems for rnaguided transposition.
we identified a novel group of tn7like transposons in cyanobacteria that preferentially target crispr arrays suggesting a new functional interaction between these elements and crisprcas systems.
using bioinformatics tools we characterized their phylogeny target specificity and subspecialization.
the arraytargeting elements are phylogenetically close to trnatargeting elements.
the distinct target preference coincides with loss of a cterminal region in the tnsd protein which is responsible for recognizing target sites when compared to closely related elements.
notably elements are found integrated into a fixed position within crispr spacer regions a behavior that might minimize negative impacts on the host defense system.
these transposons were identified in both plasmid and genomic crispr arrays indicating that their preferred target provides a means for both safe insertion in the host chromosome and a mechanism for dissemination.
attempts to reconstitute these elements in"
"outbreaks of bordetella pertussis bp the causative agent of whooping cough continue despite broad vaccination coverage and have been increasing since vaccination switched from wholebp wp to acellular bp ap vaccines.
wp vaccination has been associated with more durable protective immunity and an induced th1 polarized memory t cell response.
here a multiomics approach was applied to profile the immune response of 30 wp and 31 apprimed individuals and identify correlates of t cell polarization before and after tdap booster vaccination.
we found that transcriptional changes indicating an interferon response on day 1 postbooster along with elevated plasma concentrations of ifnγ and interferoninduced chemokines that peaked at day 13 postbooster correlated best with the th1 polarization of the vaccineinduced memory t cell response on day 28. our studies suggest that wpprimed individuals maintain their th1 polarization through this early memory interferon response.
this suggests that stimulating the interferon pathway during vaccination could be an effective strategy to elicit a predominant th1 response in apprimed individuals that protects better against infection."
"the vertebrate nervous system is vulnerable to chemical toxicity and the widespread release of chemicals into the environment outstrips the capacity to assess their safety.
we devised a battery of automated behavior assays in larval zebrafish danio rerio a 3rcompliant model amenable to higherthroughput chemical screens.
the battery captures stereotypical visual and acoustic behaviors including habituation a form of nonassociative learning.
known pharmacological modulators of habituation in zebrafish evoked distinct behavioral patterns.
by screening chemicals positive for ex vivo nmethyldaspartate receptor nmdar modulation we identified chlorophene a biocide that caused sedation paradoxical excitation and reduced habituation in zebrafish.
using in silico target predictions and pharmacological interventions we discovered that chlorophene acts via gammaaminobutyric acid a receptors gabaars a previously unknown target site.
orthogonal validation in cultured mouse cortical neurons and human stem cellderived brainspheres confirmed chlorophenes interaction with gabaars.
together multibehavioral phenotyping in zebrafish can accelerate the identification of neurotoxicants and their underlying mode of action."
"the texture of meat is one of the most important features to mimic when developing meat analogs.
both protein source and processing method impact the texture of the final product.
we can distinguish three types of mechanical tests to quantify the textural differences between meat and meat analogs puncturetype rheological torsion tests and classical mechanical tests of tension compression and bending.
here we compile the shear force and stiffness values of whole and comminuted meats and meat analogs from the two most popular tests for meat the warnerbratzler shear test and the doublecompression texture profile analysis.
our results suggest that with the right finetuning todays meat analogs are well capable of mimicking the mechanics of real meat.
while warnerbratzler shear tests and texture profile analysis provide valuable information about the tenderness and sensory perception of meat both tests suffer from a lack of standardization which limits crossstudy comparisons.
here we provide guidelines to standardize meat testing and report the meat stiffness as the single most informative mechanical parameter.
collecting big standardized data and sharing them with the community at large could empower researchers to harness the power of generative artificial intelligence to inform the systematic development of meat analogs with desired mechanical properties and functions taste and sensory perception."
"genome size exhibits substantial variation across organisms but the underlying causes and ecological consequences remain unclear.
while interspecific comparisons have suggested selective pressures against large genomes intraspecific variation has been less explored.
here we investigate genome size variation within the hexaploid yellowcress herb rorippa indica by integrating flow cytometry plastomic phylogeography genomic repeat profiling and reciprocal common garden experiments.
we analyzed 192 accessions from 83 natural populations revealing a 128 mb range in genome size.
plastome haplotype analysis identified a haplogroup that shifted niches to tropics and evolved larger genomes.
a strong correlation was found between larger genomes and tropical habitats characterized by higher temperatures and lower seasonality.
genomic repeat content particularly 45s rdna and ty1copia transposable elements was associated with larger genomes.
reciprocal transplantation experiments confirmed the adaptive nature of large genomes in tropical environments with individuals exhibiting lower growth rates but higher fecundity.
our findings support the large genome selection hypothesis suggesting that genome size enlargement driven by genomic repetitive elements can be an adaptive response to high temperatures of tropics.
as global warming continues plants with larger genomes may exhibit slower growth but increased reproductive output potentially impacting ecosystem dynamics and agricultural productivity."
"harsh environments such as those with breaking waves and turbulent flows present extreme challenges to organismal survival.
many animals exploiting these habitats possess adaptations to maintain position under dynamic flow conditions such as reversible or permanent attachment systems.
however some stationholding fishes e.g.
sculpins instead rely on morphological and behavioral modifications of their pectoral fins to increase friction with the substrate and combat drag.
despite epidermal microstructures on the fins of other benthic fishes little exploration of pectoral fin surfaces at the microscopic scale has been undertaken in sculpins.
using scanning electron microscopy we discovered microscopic fibrillar projections contained within single cells on the ventral surfaces of the paired fin rays of two intertidal and two subtidal species of marine sculpins.
in contrast to subtidal species the intertidal species possessed epidermal cells with discrete channels separating groups of fibrillar projections.
these features bear a striking resemblance to epidermal microstructures described in other fishes but have distinct morphological differences.
we posit that these previously overlooked features likely contribute to sculpin stationholding performance via enhanced mechanical interactions with the substrate suggesting new taxa within which to examine mechanisms of underwater friction enhancement and adhesion."
"ice phenology onset and breakup of ice cover regulates the timings of seasonal life history events of many animal and plant species in highlatitude lakes in the northern hemisphere promoting the coexistence of species that share resources like food and shelter.
increasingly warmer more variable earth’s climate is however shifting ice phenology modifying habitat conditions and in turn reshaping the population and interaction dynamics of many species threatening their persistence.
applying multivariate autoregressive statespace time series modeling to extensive historical and contemporary monitoring records spanning 36 to 113 years of limnological and biological surveys and fishery catches we explore how shifting ice phenology propagates through a food web over time by modulating thermal profiles and limnological properties in lake simcoe a large intensely exploited system in southern ontario canada.
analysis shows that increasingly earlier ice breakups later ice freezeups earlier thermal stratification onset and later turnover since the early 1980s attenuated algal production.
this in turn combined with increasingly more abundant invasive species dreissenids that promoted greater water clarity over prolonged stratification periods diminished zooplankton abundances.
these limnological changes filtered through plankton communities further modified the population and community dynamics of higher trophiclevel species like fish with differential thermal preferences interactively with timevarying nonclimate drivers.
although management interventions–reductions in nutrient loading and fishing effort in particular–in recent decades aided the recoveries of depleted coldadapted fish populations including lake trout lake whitefish and cisco their interaction patterns and strengths with species adapted to warmer conditions were reshuffled by advanced timings of ice breakup and delayed timings of ice freezeup.
these findings reveal how complex food web dynamics can emerge from ecologically divergent responses that reshape species interactions within and among trophic levels under shifting ice phenology filtered through bottomup processes likely buffering destabilizing effects of a changing climate."

"fungal effectors play crucial roles in plant infection.
despite low sequence identity their classification into families is feasible using structural homology.
in this study we have elucidated the structures of the two effectors mycgr391409 and ztnip1 from the wheat fungal pathogen zymoseptoria tritici using xray crystallography and nmr.
these proteins shared structural homology with respectively kp6alpha and kp4 killer toxins encoded by umv dsrna viruses infecting the corn fungal pathogen ustilago maydis.
consequently ztmycgr391409 and ztnip1 were renamed ztkp61 and ztkp41.
orthologs and paralogs of ztkp61 and ztkp41 were identified in zymoseptoria species but not in other fungi with the exception of ecp2 effectors related to ztkp41.
a novel pipeline relying on foldseek and cysteinepattern constrained hmm searches identified a large number of proteins structurally related to ztkp61 and ztkp41 in fungi and to ztkp41 in plants.
these proteins were classified into distinct structural super families 4 kp4 and 3 kp6 including effectors not known as structurally related to kp4 ecp2 or kp6 bas4.
the biological activities of ztkp61 and ztkp41 were assessed on plants and fungi.
they did not induce symptoms on wheat leaves.
however they inhibited the growth of botrytis cinerea and z. tritici demonstrating their toxicity to fungi.
these results highlight the importance of structure determination of effectors for their classification and the prediction of their function."
"normative modeling of brain morphometric data can inform about the clinical significance of deviations from typical patterns in brain structure.
their usefulness however is dependent on their applicability to diverse ethnoracial groups.
with this in mind we developed age and sexspecific normative models for cortical thickness surface area and subcortical volumes using brain scans from 37407 healthy individuals from a diverse international sample.
here we demonstrate the validity of these models in diverse and distinct populations.
specifically we tested these pretrained models on independent samples of healthy individuals that either selfidentified as black south asian east asian chinese east asian japanese or we categorized as african admixed american east asian and european based on their genetic ancestry.
regardless of ethnoracial definition the performance of the pretrained models in these samples was exceptionally high the relative mean absolute error for each regional brain morphometry measure was less than 10 across all the distinct ethnoracial groups.
these findings affirm the broad applicability of our models ensuring that brain morphometry assessments using these models are accurate and reliable for individuals regardless of background.
this broad applicability has significant implications for advancing personalized medicine and improving health outcomes in diverse populations."
"singlemolecule fluorescence imaging has extensively revealed the dynamic and structural characteristics of biomolecules.
however its application is limited by the upper concentration of fluorophoretagged biomolecules which is in the subten nanomolar range.
we found that the signaltonoise ratio snr in singlemolecule fluorescence imaging is strongly influenced by the size of fluorophorelabeled molecules in solution.
our computational simulations suggest that the faster diffusion of background fluorophores can enhance the snr of target molecules.
moreover we identified that the molecular motion through fluid flow can improve snr.
this study provides a novel perspective by emphasizing the importance of molecular motion in snr and propose a rapid barrierfree method to increase the upper concentration limit in singlemolecule imaging."
"degenerative musculoskeletal diseases like osteoarthritis can be initiated by joint injury.
injurious overloadinginduced mechanical straining of articular cartilage and subsequent biological responses may trigger cartilage degradation.
one early sign of degradation is loss of aggrecan content which is potentially accelerated near chondral lesions under physiological loading.
yet the mechanoinflammatory mechanisms explaining timedependent degradation in regions with disparate mechanical loading are unclear and challenging to assess with experiments alone.
here we developed computational models unraveling potential mechanisms behind aggrecan content adaptation.
incorporating mechanical straindriven cell damage and downstream proteolytic enzyme release fluid flowdriven aggrecan depletion and fluid pressurestimulated regulation of aggrecan biosynthesis the models agreed with experiments and exhibited 14points greater nearlesion aggrecan loss after 12 days of physiological loading compared to without loading.
this significant advancement in mechanistic understanding incorporated into cartilage adaptation model can help in development and guidance of personalized therapies such as rehabilitation protocols and tissueengineered constructs."
"climate change and globalization are accelerating biological invasions highlighting the urgent need to understand adaptation mechanisms in invaded environments to improve management strategies.
genomic data can provide insights into the adaptation of invasive species through genotypeenvironment association gea studies identifying genes and biological processes associated with invasion success and more globally to estimate genetic maladaptation to new environments by calculating genomic offset go statistics.
in this study we investigate genetic adaptation in the invasive crop pest  using novel genomic resources and statistical methods.
we rely on a new chromosomelevel genome assembly and a dataset representing 36 populations combining both publicly available and newly generated pooled and individual sequencing data which are analyzed using an enhanced version of the baypass software tailored for such hybrid datasets.
we identify a limited number of genomic regions associated with invasion success supporting the hypothesis of a polygenic architecture of the underlying adaptive traits.
using a gea incorporating 28 environmental covariates we further estimate go between source environments and invaded areas to gain insight into the adaptive challenges faced by  during past invasions.
reciprocally we estimate go between putative source environments and geographic areas that have not yet been invaded to predict regions at risk for potential future invasions.
finally we used go calculation to identify high risk regions from which preadapted populations could likely originate.
our results suggest that the adaptive challenge for  populations to invade their current major invasion range was limited.
we also identified uninvaded regions in africa south america and australia as being at high risk of future invasion.
while further sampling and more extensive individual sequencing could refine these conclusions our study provides important insights into"
"despite the importance of mineralassociated organic matter maom in longterm soil carbon c and nitrogen n persistence and the significant contribution of fungal necromass to this pool the factors controlling the formation of fungalderived maom remain unclear.
this study investigated how fungal necromass chemistry specifically melanin interacts with soil mineral properties and microbial communities to influence maom formation and persistence.
we cultured the fungus hyaloscypha bicolor to produce 13c and 15nlabeled necromass with varying melanin content high or low and incubated it in both live and sterile soils collected from six indiana forests that differed in their clay and iron oxide feox content.
after 38 days we found that seven times more fungalderived n was incorporated into maom than fungalderived c with fungal n comprising 20 of the maomn pool.
low melanin necromass formed more maomc than high melanin necromass although sitelevel differences in overall maom formation were substantial.
soil clay and feox content were strong predictors of maom formation explaining 60 and 68 of the variation in maomc and maomn respectively.
however microbial communities significantly influenced maom formation with maomc formation enhanced and maomn formation reduced in sterile soils.
furthermore the relative abundance of fungal saprotrophs was negatively correlated and bacterial richness was positively correlated with maom formation and these relationships were influenced by necromass melanin content.
this study reveals that microbial communities and soil properties interactively mediate the incorporation of fungal necromass c and n into maom with microbes differentially influencing c and n incorporation and these processes being further modulated by necromass melanization."

"insects provide a potential source of sustainable alternative protein that can help meet the protein demands of a growing population.
efficient farming of insects to meet this demand depends on an understanding of insect life history.
yet detailed information and expertise about a single species are not always available for practitioners to make informed decisions about rearing practices or identify arising issues.
the cricket  is commonly farmed for human consumption or animal feed but few studies have characterized the life history of this species throughout ontogeny.
here we describe the growth and development of  from hatch to adulthood and quantify reproductive traits relevant to massrearing and colony management including egg development.
this information provides foundation to start and manage a cricket colony and to conduct research on growth and performance.
we highlight ways that a fundamental understanding of cricket biology can be informative for optimizing cricket growth reducing variability in yield and informing future precision farming practices."
