Insects like ants, despite their limited computational resources, demonstrate remarkable abilities in navigation. Existing computational models often fall short in faithfully replicating the morphology of real insects and their interactions with the environment, hindering validation and practical application in robotics. To address these gaps, we present I2Bot, a novel simulation tool based on the morphological characteristics of desert ants. This tool empowers robotic models with dynamic sensory capabilities, realistic modeling of insect morphology, physical dynamics, and sensory capacity. By integrating gait controllers and sensory-motor loops, our approach elucidates fundamental navigation principles. By open-sourcing I2Bot, we aim to accelerate the understanding of insect intelligence and foster advances in the development of autonomous robotic systems."]},

Here, we show that replacing the normalisation offsets unlocks bulk RNA-seq workflows for scalable differential usage, aberrant splicing and expression analyses. Our method, saseR, is much faster than state-of-the-art methods, dramatically outperforms these to detect aberrant splicing, and provides a single workflow for various short- and long-read RNA-seq applications."]},

We introduce diaTracer, a new spectrum-centric computational tool optimized for diaPASEF data. diaTracer performs three-dimensional (m/z, retention time, ion mobility) peak tracing and feature detection to generate precursor-resolved \"pseudo-MS/MS\" spectra, facilitating direct (\"spectral-library free\") peptide identification and quantification from diaPASEF data. diaTracer is available as a stand-alone tool and is fully integrated into the widely used FragPipe computational platform. We demonstrate the performance of diaTracer and FragPipe using diaPASEF data from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma samples, data from phosphoproteomics and HLA immunopeptidomics experiments, and low-input data from a spatial proteomics study. We also show that diaTracer enables unrestricted identification of post-translational modifications from diaPASEF data using open/mass-offset searches."]},

Taiwan, has recruited 565,390 participants who consented to provide DNA samples for genetic profiling and grant access to their electronic medical records (EMR) for studies to develop precision medicine. Access to the EMR is both retrospective and prospective, allowing researchers to conduct prospective studies over time. Genetic profiling is done with population-optimized SNP arrays for the Han Chinese populations that enable genetic analyses such as genome-wide association, phenome-wide association, and polygenic risk score studies to evaluate common disease risk and pharmacogenetic response. Furthermore, the TPMI participants agree to be contacted for future research opportunities related to their genetic risks and receive personalized genetic risk profiles with health management recommendations. TPMI has established the TPMI Data Access Platform (TDAP), a central database and analysis platform that both safeguards the security of the data and facilitates academic research. The TPMI is the largest non-European cohort that merges genetic profiles with EMR in the world. With a cohort that can be followed over time, it can be utilized to validate genetic risk prediction models, conduct clinical trials to show the efficacy of risk-based health management, and optimize health policies based on genetic risks. In this report, we describe the TPMI study design, the population and genetic characteristics of the TPMI cohort, and the power it provides to conduct crucial studies in developing precision medicine on a population and personal level. As Han Chinese represent almost 20% of the world's population, the results of TPMI studies will benefit >1.4 billion people around the world and serve as a model for developing population-based precision medicine."]},

However, the link between gut microbiota and age-related gout remained underexplored. Our study found that gut microbiota plays a crucial role in determining susceptibility to age-related gout. Specifically, we observed that age-related gut microbiota regulated the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and modulated uric acid metabolism. More scrutiny highlighted the positive impact of \"younger\" microbiota on the gut microbiota structure of old or aged mice, enhancing butanoate metabolism and butyric acid content. Experimentation with butyrate supplementation indicated that butyric acid exerts a dual effect, inhibiting inflammation in acute gout and reducing serum uric acid levels.

RecA, the master regulator of the SOS response, plays a crucial role in driving the evolution of resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics treated with a single dose of ciprofloxacin. However, the precise roles of RecA and SOS responses in the development of resistance under short-term β-lactam exposure remain unclear. In the present study, we observed a fast evolution of β-lactam resistance (20-fold) increase in MIC in 8 hours) in E. coli after deleting RecA and exposing the bacteria to a single dose of ampicillin. Notably, once this type of resistance is established, it remains stable and can be passed on to subsequent generations. Unlike earlier studies, we found that the rapid development of resistance relies on the hindrance of DNA repair, a mechanism that operates independently of the SOS response. Additionally, we identified the rapid emergence of drug resistance associated mutations in the resistant bacterial genome, indicating the impairment of DNA repair. Through comprehensive transcriptome sequencing, we discovered that the expression of numerous antioxidative response genes is repressed in recA mutant resistant isolates, resulting in an excessive accumulation of ROS within the cells. This suggests that the induction of ROS drives the fast evolution of antibiotic resistance in RecA-deficient bacteria. \nCollectively, we show that the hindrance of DNA repair hampers cellular fitness, provides bacteria with genetic adaptability to survive in diverse stressful environments, and accelerates the evolution of antibiotic resistance."]},

The emergent lineage acquired novel prophage along with genes encoding novel catalytic and metabolic functions, but shows little variation among the virulence proteins considered host specificity determinants.

We identified overexpression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells that survive cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) exposure, suggesting a mechanism of CTL resistance. Inhibition of EZH2 with the FDA-approved drug tazemetostat increased surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) on CD4+ T-cells, counterbalancing HIV Nef-mediated MHC-I downregulation. This improved CTL-mediated elimination of HIV-infected cells and suppressed viral replication in vitro. In a participant-derived xenograft mouse model, tazemetostat elevated MHC-I and the pro-apoptotic protein BIM in CD4+ T-cells, facilitating CD8+ T-cell-mediated reductions of HIV reservoir seeding. Additionally, tazemetostat promoted sustained skewing of CD8+ T-cells toward less differentiated and exhausted phenotypes. Our findings reveal EZH2 overexpression as a novel mechanism of CTL resistance and support the clinical evaluation of tazemetostat to enhance clearance of HIV reservoirs and improve CD8+ T-cell function."]},

This is especially true for students engaged in biophysics research, where many of the concepts, definitions, and experimental methodologies discussed may be beyond the material covered in standard undergraduate courses. Without specific guidance on how to read journal articles, students can become overwhelmed, which may lead to students reading fewer papers and not engaging with the scientific literature related to their research. To help undergraduate students effectively engage with scientific papers, we have developed a guided reading protocol that combines pre-reading strategies, structured notetaking, and the use of ChatGPT. Using ChatGPT in this protocol allows students to clarify unfamiliar terms and concepts in an interactive way that helps them to integrate the paper’s content into their own understanding. To test the impact of this protocol, participants in this study were given an initial survey to determine their comfort and experience with reading scientific literature. After this they were given an abridged biophysics paper and the ChatGPT assisted guided reading protocol. The ChatGPT transcripts were analyzed using open coding and the students were given a post-study survey to determine how they felt about their experience using ChatGPT. We found that most students do not appear to engage with the literature regularly, which may be due to barriers they encounter in terms of new and unknown content. Analyzing their conversations with the chatbot, we observed that students asked for definitions, explanations of unknown concepts, summaries of text or their own understanding, and simplifications of the text. Overall, students reported in the post-implementation survey that using ChatGPT was a positive experience and all students reported that they expected to use ChatGPT in the future when reading scientific literature. From this work, we believe that this new chatbot assisted reading protocol may be a way to keep novice biophysics students from becoming discouraged when they begin reading scientific literature and help keep them engaged with the current literature in the field."]},

On 22 March 2018, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) released the documentary “Contagion! The BBC Four Pandemic” to describe the science behind pandemic preparedness in the UK. The authors of this article were responsible for producing a mathematical simulation for that documentary of how a highly contagious respiratory pathogen might spread across the UK. According to the documentary narrative, the ‘outbreak’ begins in the town of Haslemere, England. To ground the simulation in true human interaction patterns, a three-day citizen science experiment was conducted during which the pairwise distances between 469 volunteers in Haslemere were tracked continuously using a mobile phone app. Here, we offer a scientific companion to the documentary in which we describe the methods behind our simulation and release the pairwise interpersonal distance dataset. We discuss salient features of the dataset, including daily patterns in the clustering and volatility of interpersonal interactions. Our epidemiological analysis of the simulated Haslemere outbreak serves as a springboard to discuss scientific opportunities opened by the Haslemere dataset and others like it. We believe that the Haslemere dataset will productively challenge current strategies for incorporating population structure into disease transmission models, and hope that it will inspire the collection and analysis of other similar datasets in the future."]},

Understanding the quantitative association between antibiotic use and resulting resistance is important for predicting future rates of antibiotic resistance and for designing antibiotic stewardship policy. However, the use-resistance association is complicated by “spillover”, in which one population’s level of antibiotic use affects another population’s level of resistance via the transmission of bacteria between those populations. Spillover is known to have effects at the level of families and hospitals, but it is unclear if spillover is relevant at larger scales. We used mathematical modeling and analysis of observational data to address this question. First, we used dynamical models of antibiotic resistance to predict the effects of spillover. Whereas populations completely isolated from one another do not experience any spillover, we found that if even 1% of interactions are between populations, then spillover may have large consequences: the effect of a change in antibiotic use in one population on antibiotic resistance in that population could be reduced by as much as 50%. Then, we quantified spillover in observational antibiotic use and resistance data from US states and European countries for 3 pathogen-antibiotic combinations, finding that increased interactions between populations were associated with smaller differences in antibiotic resistance between those populations. Thus, spillover may have an important impact at the level of states and countries, which has ramifications for predicting the future of antibiotic resistance, designing antibiotic resistance stewardship policy, and interpreting stewardship interventions."]},

We compare the social fluidity of 13 species by applying the model to empirical human and animal social interaction data. To investigate how social behavior influences the likelihood of an epidemic outbreak we derive an analytical expression of the relationship between social fluidity and the basic reproductive number of an infectious disease. For highly fluid social behaviour disease transmission is revealed to be density-dependent. For species that form more stable social bonds, the model describes frequency-dependent transmission that is sensitive to changes in social fluidity."]},

We particularly consider the challenges in replicating studies exactly, using the notion of the idealized experiment. We argue against treating reproducibility as an inherently desirable property of scientific results, and in favor of viewing it as a tool to measure distance between an original study and its replications. To sensibly study the implications of replicability and results reproducibility on inference, such a measure of replication distance is needed. We present an effort to delineate such a framework here, addressing some challenges in capturing the components of scientific studies while identifying others as ongoing issues. We illustrate our measure of replication distance by simulations using a toy example. Rather than replications, we present purposefully planned modifications as an appropriate tool to inform scientific inquiry. Our ability to measure replication distance serves scientists in their search for replication-ready studies.

Here, we introduce MSFragger-DDA+, a novel database search algorithm that enhances peptide identification by detecting co-fragmented peptides with high sensitivity and speed. Utilizing MSFragger's fragment ion indexing algorithm, MSFragger-DDA+ performs a comprehensive search within the full isolation window for each MS2, followed by robust feature detection, filtering, and rescoring procedures to refine search results. Evaluation against established tools across diverse datasets demonstrated that, integrated within the FragPipe computational platform, MSFragger-DDA+ significantly increases identification sensitivity while maintaining stringent false discovery rate (FDR) control. It is also uniquely suited for wide-window acquisition (WWA) data.

DA offers a new perspective to solve the \"dropout\" problem beyond imputation. Second, we present DAZZLE, a stabilized and robust version of the autoencoder-based structure equation model for GRN inference using the DA concept. Benchmark experiments illustrate the improved performance and increased stability of the proposed DAZZLE model over existing approaches. The practical application of the DAZZLE model on a longitudinal mouse microglia dataset containing over 15,000 genes illustrates its ability to handle real-world single cell data with minimal gene filtration. The improved robustness and stability of DAZZLE make it a practical and valuable addition to the toolkit for GRN inference from single-cell data. Finally, we propose that Dropout Augmentation may have wider applications beyond the GRN-inference problem.  Project website: https://bcb.cs.tufts.edu/DAZZLE."]},

Obese Adi-HsPRR male mice showed elevated plasma sPRR compared with controls, but no correlation with adiposity was found in either group. Nevertheless, Adi-HsPRR expression improved insulin sensitivity and endothelial function, reduced adipogenic genes mRNA abundance (PPARg, SEBP1C and CD36), and increased plasma Angiotensin 1-7 levels only in obese HsPPR female mice. Taken together, elevated HsPRR in adipose tissue improved metabolic and vascular function in obese female mice despite normal circulating levels of sPRR, whereas increased local and circulating levels of HsPRR did not influence metabolic and cardiovascular function in obese male mice. Our data suggest that increased plasma sPRR associated with metabolic disease could be produced by other tissues rather than adipocytes."]},

However, the mechanisms of evolving antimicrobial resistance in such polymicrobial environments are poorly understood. We previously reported that magnesium depletion caused by the fungus Candida albicans can enable Pseudomonas aeruginosa to acquire significant resistance to colistin, a last-resort antibiotic targeting bacterial membrane. Here, we dissect the genetic and biochemical basis of this increased colistin resistance. We show that P. aeruginosa cells can acquire colistin resistance using three distinct evolutionary trajectories involving mutations in genes involved in lipid A biosynthesis, lipid A modifications that are dependent on low Mg2+, and a putative Mg2+ transporter, PA4824. These mutations confer colistin resistance by altering acyl chains, hydroxylation, and aminoarabinose modification of lipid A moieties on the bacterial outer membrane. In all cases, enhanced colistin resistance initially depends on the low Mg2+-responsive PhoPQ pathway, which potentiates the evolution of resistance mutations and lipid A modifications that do not occur without Mg2+ depletion. However, the PhoPQ pathway is not required to maintain high colistin resistance in all cases. In most cases, the genetic and biochemical changes associated with these novel forms of colistin resistance also impair bacterial membrane integrity, leading to fitness costs. Our findings provide molecular insights into how nutritional competition drives a novel antibiotic resistance mechanism and its ensuing fitness tradeoffs."]},

Accessory genes encoded in the diversity hotspots are involved in anti-MGE defence and counter-defence, virulence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), thus playing key roles in interactions amongst phages, MGEs, bacteria and eukaryotic hosts. To date the majority of research has been focused on either individual hotspots or on relatively limited sets of hotspots in a small set of genomes, typically from a single species. A global understanding of hotspot diversity and dynamics still lacking. To address this gap, we developed iLund4u, an algorithm for the systematic annotation of hotspots across millions of sequences. Using a proteome composition approach, iLund4u detects proteome communities, annotates accessory proteins and identifies hotspots. By analysing 873K phage genomes and 696K plasmid sequences we identified 13.7K hotspots and 171K diverse protein families encoded there as cargo. Furthermore, iLund4u allows for protein search and proteome annotation functions versus a precomputed iLund4u database. In the protein search mode iLund4u identifies all hotspots that encode homologues of a query protein. In the proteome annotation mode iLund4u annotates hotspots by searching for communities of similar proteomes.

Bioinformatic methods promise higher throughput; despite robust computational identification of riboswitches, however, computational classification of riboswitch mechanism has so far been both model-bound, relying on identification of sequence motifs known to be required for specific models of riboswitch activity, and empirically untested, with predictions far outpacing biological validation.

Epimutations mediated by RNA interference (RNAi) and/or chromatin modifications can confer antifungal drug resistance and may impact virulence traits in fungi. However, whether these epigenetic modifications can be transmitted across generations following sexual reproduction was unclear. This study demonstrates that RNAi epimutations conferring antifungal drug resistance are transgenerationally inherited in the human fungal pathogen Mucor circinelloides. Our research reveals that RNAi-based antifungal resistance follows a DNA sequence-independent, non-Mendelian inheritance pattern. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are the exclusive determinants of inheritance, transmitting drug resistance independently of other known repressive epigenetic modifications. Unique sRNA signature patterns can be traced through inheritance from parent to progeny, further supporting RNA as an alternative molecule for transmitting information across generations. This study marks a significant advance in understanding epigenetic inheritance, highlighting RNAi-exclusive epimutations as a widespread phenomenon in the pathogenic M. circinelloides species complex. Understanding how epimutations occur, propagate, and confer resistance may enable their detection in other eukaryotic pathogens, provide solutions for challenges posed by rising antimicrobial drug resistance (AMR), and also advance research on phenotypic adaptability and its evolutionary implications."]},

To test this hypothesis, 101 Arabic-speaking children who just began their formal reading instruction in Arabic were administered tests of syllable and word reading. Their nonverbal reasoning, vocabulary, phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming and letter knowledge were measured. Their visual attention was estimated through tasks of visual attention span. We found that phonological awareness, visual attention span and letter knowledge were associated with reading outcomes.

These findings support the cognitive models of word recognition that include visual attention as a component of the reading system.

Recent discoveries of AxSpA-specific T cell receptor (TCR) motifs and the self and bacterial peptides that they recognize support a pathogenic role of CD8+ T cells. Despite of previous work on synovial fluid, the characteristics of CD8 cells in joint tissue are currently unknown.\nMethod: Synovial tissues from 5 AxSpA patients were used for single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq). Paired TCR sequencing was carried out for 2. The abundance of KIR+ CD8+ T cells in the blood from 9 AxSpA patients and 10 healthy controls was measured using flow cytometry. The expression of naive and memory T cell markers (CCR7, CD45RA and CD45RO) were compared between KIR+ and KIR- CD8 cells.\nResults: We observed conventional, TRAV1-2+ mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cell and MKI67+ proliferating cell populations in synovium. Following sub-clustering of conventional CD8+ T cells, HLA-DR+ tissue resident memory (TRM), circulating, KIR+ and FCGR3A+ (encoding CD16) cell subsets were observed. HLA-DR+ TRM and KIR+ cells were clonally expanded and exhibited distinct transcriptional features, enriched for T cell activation pathways and natural killer (NK) cell mediated cytotoxicity pathway respectively.

However, discrepant results have emerged with regard to whether PERM1 loss-of-function affect cardiac contractility. In order to exclude the possibility that the reported negative results can be due to insufficient power of statistical test, we conducted a more robust echocardiography (Echo) analysis by increasing the sample size. We used Perm1-KO and their respective wildtype (WT) littermates, which were destined to tissue harvest. This yielded 84 WT mice and 88 Perm1-KO mice. We analyzed Echo-derived parameters of left ventricular (LV) systolic function. At the end of the study, ejection fraction (EF) was 65.43 +/- 7.13 in WT vs. 53.98 +/- 8.80 in Perm1-KO yielding p < 0.00000000000000004. Other parameters which reached statistically significant difference between WT and Perm1-KO (at p < 0.05) included LV fractional shortening (FS), LV diastolic and systolic diameters, LV anterior and posterior systolic wall thickness, LV posterior wall systolic thickening, stroke volume, and cardiac output (CO). Retrospectively, a p value < 0.05 was consistently achieved in assessment of EF only after average N per group reached 13. Larger minimal N per group were required for other parameters. Of interest, in both groups there were no correlation between EF% and CO. At the same time, in both groups EF strongly inversely correlated with LV diastolic diameter. This led us to a speculation that low EF may be in part compensated by an increased LV circumference, for the purpose of maintaining invariant CO. Indeed, the intergroup difference in CO (6%) was much smaller than the intergroup difference in EF (18%). We conclude that PERM1 does regulate cardiac mechanics. Changes caused by constitutive Perm1-KO can be conceptualized as reduced contractility partially compensated by increased LV circumference. This study underscores the importance of sufficiently large sample size for detecting significant differences in Echo data."]},

We present a high-throughput field-based phenotyping approach, FieldDino, for screening of stomatal physiology and anatomy.

Validation in large field trials of 200 wheat genotypes with two irrigation treatments captured wide diversity in stomatal traits.

Lead affects various body systems, especially the brain, causing long-lasting cognitive and behavioral changes. While most studies have focused on continuous lead exposure, intermittent exposure, such as that caused by migration or relocations, has received less attention. Importantly, lead exposure intensifies the severity of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies, diseases involving the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) in the brain and in the gut. Although, the precise mechanisms underlying these observations remain unclear, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction likely play a role. Here, we investigated how two different profiles of lead exposure - continuous and intermittent - affect models of synucleinopathies. We found that lead exposure enhances the formation of aSyn inclusions, resulting in an increase in both their number and size in cell models. In addition, we found that animals injected with aSyn pre-formed fibrils display serine 129-phosphorylated aSyn inclusions and a reduction in astrocytes in the substantia nigra. These animals also display neuronal damage and alterations in locomotor activity, exploratory behavior, anxiety, memory impairments and hypertension. Our results suggest a mechanistic link between environmental lead exposure and the onset and progression of diseases associated with aSyn pathology. Understanding the molecular and cellular interactions between lead and aSyn is crucial for shaping public health policies and may provide novel insight into strategies for mitigating the impact of environmental toxins on neurodegenerative processes involved in Parkinson’s disease and related synucleinopathies."]},

Scoping how social science approaches are used in this area is important to understanding whether biology education research could benefit from complementary approaches that might advance praxis. This analysis found that research informing the biology education community draws heavily from psychological perspectives that are overwhelmingly not disaggregated (78% of articles identifying a group used a lumped together one), are by far more quantitative (58% used survey, 26% grades, 20% school data) than qualitative (17% used interview, 10% observation), and did not (72%) adopt structural approaches.

Genetic concepts can be depicted with lines, letters, shapes, and symbols, and students need to engage their visual literacy skills to appropriately decipher these abstract representations. We previously found that undergraduate course materials almost always represent chromosomes in abstract forms, such as “X” shapes or straight lines with a dot for the centromere. We hypothesized that students struggle to apply their visual literacy skills to accurately interpret these abstract representations of chromosomes, which may be related to the frequently-documented incomplete or incorrect ideas students have about chromosome structure and function. To explore students’ visual literacy related to representations of chromosomes, we conducted 35 semi-structured interviews with students who had taken at least a year of biology courses. We asked them to sketch chromosomes, interpret an abstract representation of chromosomes, and use the abstract representation to answer a question about meiosis. We found that 97% of participants (34 of 35) held conceptual errors related to chromosome structure and function. These conceptual errors were often not evident in participants’ verbal definitions of chromosomes and were only revealed in their sketches or explanations of their sketches. We found that participants frequently misinterpreted X-shaped representations of chromosomes, mistook unreplicated homologous chromosomes as separated sister chromatids, and held misconceptions related to the structure and function of centromeres. These findings have implications for how chromosomes are taught in biology courses. We recommend that instructors explicitly discuss the conventions and norms of representing chromosomes as a pathway for increasing students’ visual literacy in molecular biology."]},

In this work, we design and validate a plasmid set – the pXpressome toolkit -in which α-carboxysomes are robustly expressed and remain intact and functional after purification. We tested this toolkit by introducing mutations which influence carboxysome structure and performance. We find that deletion of vertex-capping genes results in formation of larger carboxysomes while deletion of facet forming genes produces smaller particles, suggesting that adjusting the ratio of these proteins can rationally affect morphology.

It is generally believed that different RNA viruses are recognized by either RIG-I or MDA5, two important RLR members, depending on the nature of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are generated during RNA virus infection. However, it remains elusive which RLR is involved in sensing the PAMPs of Dengue virus (DENV), an important RNA virus causing serious human diseases, and the molecular basis of the DENV PAMPs is poorly defined. Here, we demonstrated that the DENV infection-induced interferon response is dependent upon both RIG-I and MDA5, with RIG-I playing a predominant role. Next we purified the DENV PAMPs from the DENV-infected cells by biochemical approaches and demonstrated that the purified DENV PAMPs are viral full-length double-stranded RNA bearing 5’ppp modifications, likely representing the viral replicative-form RNA. Finally, we confirmed the nature of the DENV PAMPs by reconstituting the viral replicative-form RNA from in vitro synthesized DENV genomic RNA. In conclusion, our work defined the molecular basis of the RLR-PAMP interactions during DENV infection, and revealed the previously neglected cooperative contributions by different RLRs in innate immunity against RNA viruses."]},

Current autofocusing solutions are limited to focusing precision and range, thus impeding their application in high-accuracy research. Here, we introduce LUNA (locking under nanoscale accuracy), an innovative autofocusing method that leverages the coma pattern of detection light to characterize focus drift. LUNA improves the focusing precision down to 3 nm and extends the focusing range to at least 40 times the objective depth-of-focus. These advancements enable us to investigate how bacteria adapt to temperature change at the single-cell level, revealing a series of novel insights into bacterial cold shock response mechanisms. This approach addresses the complexities of growth dynamics, growth mode transition, division synchronization, and size regulation during the adaptation period, which present significant challenges for traditional analytical methods. Notably, the controversies between the growth lag of batch culture and continuous growth at the single-cell level are successfully explained based on scattering theory.

Here, we conducted integrated 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomic analyses in T2D GK rats and healthy Wistar rats that exposed to four natural dietary drugs (highly porous activated carbon, wheatgrass, dandelion and corn stigma). Oral administration of activated carbon and dandelion decreased the body weight gain in both high-fat diet (HFD) GK rats and Wistar rats. Significantly lower level of blood glucose was observed in GK rats with activated carbon intervention. A group of beneficial bacteria and metabolites were promoted, and the endotoxin-producing bacteria were inhibited by dietary drugs, especially for the activated carbon diet. Oral administration of activated carbon resulted in metabolic changes and anti-inflammatory effects that decreased both high-fat diet-induced obesity and diabetes. The beneficial effects of increased positive responders are related to improved carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, regulated inflammatory mediators, with simultaneous reduction of detrimental compounds such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis and modification of the gut microbiome. These findings highlight the effectiveness of natural dietary drugs, with a particular emphasis on activated carbon, and establish a foundation for tailoring the use of these drugs in T2D therapy."]},

We aimed to identify its cellular source in synovial tissue from patients with Axial SpA (AxSpA) and Psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Methods: Synovial tissue from patients with SpA was profiled using single-cell RNA sequencing(scRNA-seq: AxSpA, n=5 and PsA, n=6) or spatial RNA profiling (PsA, n=4). CellPhoneDB was used to infer cell-cell communication. Tissue resident memory Th17 (TRM17)-like cells were generated in vitro using blood memory CD4+ T cells from SpA patients. An epigenetic inhibitor library, siRNA and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) were used to identify epigenetic regulator(s) for TRM17. Results: scRNA-seq showed that IL-17A expression in SpA synovium was restricted to CD4+CXCR6+ TRM17 cells. Cell-cell communication and single-cell spatial analysis support the interaction between TRM17 and CLEC10A+ dendritic cells, which were activated in SpA. Both sublining and lining fibroblasts in SpA synovium exhibited an enhanced IL-17A response signature. TRM17-like cells generated in vitro phenocopied the TRM17 found in joint tissue and produced IL-17A in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation but not cytokines. IL-23 enhanced TCR-mediated IL-17F and IFN-gamma; but not IL-17A production. Perturbation of BRD1 inhibited the generation of TRM17-like cells. Conclusions: CD4+ TRM17 cells are the predominant source of IL-17A in SpA. The TCR stimulation is essential for the secretion of IL-17A by TRM17-like cells. The epigenetic regulator BRD1 contributes to the generation of TRM17. Depleting TRM17 cells in SpA is a therapeutic strategy with potential to induce longterm remission."]},

In particular, sequence alignment is a fundamental building block in many sequence analysis pipelines and is frequently a performance-critical bottleneck both in time and memory. Classical sequence alignment algorithms are based on dynamic programming and often require quadratic time and memory with respect to the sequence length. As a result, classic sequence alignment algorithms fail to scale with increasing sequence lengths and quickly become memory-bound due to data-movement penalties. Results: Processing-In-Memory (PIM) is an emerging architectural paradigm that seeks to accelerate memory-bound algorithms by bringing computation closer to the data to mitigate data-movement penalties. This work presents BIMSA (Bidirectional In-Memory Sequence Alignment), a PIM-optimized implementation of the state-of-the-art sequence alignment algorithm BiWFA (Bidirectional Wavefront Alignment), incorporating hardware-aware optimizations for a production-ready PIM architecture (UPMEM). BIMSA achieves speedups up to 22.24x (11.95x on average) compared to state-of-the-art PIM-enabled implementations of sequence alignment algorithms, and supports aligning sequences of thousands of bases, exceeding the limitations of current PIM-accelerated implementations. BIMSA also achieves speedups up to 5.84x (2.83x on average) compared to the most efficient multicore CPU implementation of BiWFA. Most notably, BIMSA exhibits linear scalability with the number of compute units, enabling further performance improvements with upcoming PIM architectures equipped with more compute units and achieving speedups up to 9.56x (4.7x on average)."]},

Antibodies were classified as successful or unsuccessful based on standardized validation experiments, and the structural and functional properties of their immunogens were analysed. Results indicated that longer immunogens often resulted in more successful but less specific antibodies. Shorter immunogens (50 residues or fewer) with disordered or unfolded regions at the N- or C-terminus and long coil stretches were more likely to generate successful antibodies. Conversely, immunogens with high beta sheet content, multiple secondary structure elements, transmembrane regions, or disulfide bridges were associated with poorer antibody performance.

Sequence-to-function models such as SpliceAI support discovery of splice altering variants but filtering their output to identify pathogenic mutations remains challenging. We developed SpliPath to address 2 unmet needs in this process. First, SpliPath links the output of SpliceAI with reference transcriptomics data. This allows users to identify genetic variants that induce unannotated splice isoforms selectively expressed in disease models or patient tissue. Second, SpliPath aggregates variants with similar functional consequences into collapsed splicing quantitative trait loci (csQTLs) for more powerful genetic association analyses. We first used SpliPath to annotate whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 9,467 ALS patients and controls using RNAseq data from an iPSC model of TDP-43 dysfunction. Through this, SpliPath identified 53 variants predicted to enhance cryptic exon (CE) retention events associated with a core ALS pathomechanism. We then applied SpliPath to 294 ALS patients where both WGS and RNAseq were available and discovered missing genetic risk in the known ALS gene KIF5A. This revealed a first of kind intronic mutation hotspot that was validated using minigene reporter assays. Finally, using the same RNAseq data we then predicted 754 candidate csQTL for an independent WGS cohort of 6,625 ALS patients and 2,472 controls. Unbiased genomewide csQTL association testing successfully recovered KIF5A and nominated EPG5 as a potential pathogenic gene. These effects were undetectable using simplistic SpliceAI gene burden tests. Collectively, our study demonstrates the utility of SpliPath for uncovering missing heritability in rare disorders."]},

Our group recently discovered elevated neolacto-series glycosphingolipids (nsGSL) surface levels as a possible immune evasion mechanism of tumors. We demonstrated a direct disruption of both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity in vitro when expression of nsGSLs was upregulated on established target cells. It remains unclear however, whether in vivo nsGSLs play an active role in tumor development and can aid tumors in evading immune responses. To investigate whether nsGSLs facilitate tumor progression in vivo, we first established a murine model system using MC38-OVA cell lines with varying cell surface levels of nsGSLs. In vitro analysis revealed reduced MHC-I accessibility on tumor cells with elevated nsGSLs profiles, leading to diminished activation of OVA-specific OT-I T cells as evidenced by decreased expression of CD25, CD69, and production of IFNg, which subsequently resulted in decreased tumor cell death. Subsequent in vivo experiments investigating tumor outgrowth after engraftment of subcutaneously injected MC38-OVA cell lines with low or high cell surface levels of nsGSLs demonstrated better growth of nsGSL-rich tumor cells compared to nsGSL-poor tumors which could be controlled. Together these results suggest that nsGSLs expressed by tumors can facilitate immune evasion and subsequent tumor progression. These data pave the way to explore whether targeting of the GSL pathway with specific inhibitors could be advantageous as a therapy against tumors with high nsGSL levels."]},

This study explores the extent of sY misidentification within the human phosphoproteome by distinguishing between sulfation and phosphorylation based on their mass difference. Using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), we screened ~45M peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) from the PeptideAtlas Human Phosphoproteome build for peptidoforms with mass error shifts indicative of sulfation. This analysis pinpointed 104 candidate sulfated peptidoforms, backed-up by Gene Ontology (GO) terms and custom terms linked to sulfation. False positive filtering by manual annotation resulted in 31 convincing peptidoforms spanning 7 known and 7 novel sY sites. Y47 in Calumenin was particularly intriguing since mass error shifts, acidic motif conservation, and MS2 neutral loss patterns characteristic of sulfation, but not phosphorylation, provided strong evidence that this site can only be sulfated. Overall, although misidentification of sulfation in phosphoproteomics datasets derived from cell and tissue intracellular extracts can occur, it appears relatively rare and should not be considered a confounding factor for high-quality phosphoproteomics studies."]},

Our models recapitulate known associations between histone PTMs and expression patterns, including predicting that acetylation of histone subunit H3 lysine residue 27 (H3K27ac) near the transcription start site (TSS) significantly increases expression levels. To validate this prediction experimentally and investigate how natural vs. engineered deposition of H3K27ac might differentially affect expression, we apply the synthetic dCas9-p300 histone acetyltransferase system to 8 genes in the HEK293T cell line and to 5 genes in the K562 cell line. Further, to facilitate model building, we perform MNase-seq to map genome-wide nucleosome occupancy levels in HEK293T. We observe that our models perform well in accurately ranking relative fold-changes among genes in response to the dCas9-p300 system; however, their ability to rank fold-changes within individual genes is noticeably diminished compared to predicting expression across cell types from their native epigenetic signatures. Our findings highlight the need for more comprehensive genome-scale epigenome editing datasets, better understanding of the actual modifications made by epigenome editing tools, and improved causal models that transfer better from endogenous cellular measurements to perturbation experiments.

A comprehensive assessment requires understanding the simultaneous temporal dynamics of its multiple functional branches, which traditional methods often overlook. Objective: To develop and validate a noninvasive method for simultaneously assessing the temporal dynamics of sympathetic and parasympathetic baroreflexes using pulse contour analysis and the sequence method. Methods: Beat-to-beat blood pressure and ECG recordings were analyzed from 55 preoperative cardiothoracic surgery patients in the supine position and 21 subjects from the EUROBAVAR dataset in both supine and standing positions. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP), interbeat interval (IBI), cardiac output (CO), myocardial contraction (dP/dtmax), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were estimated using pulse contour analysis. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was calculated via the sequence method and correlated with hemodynamic and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters. Results: Parasympathetic BRS for IBI was correlated with the root mean square of successive differences of ECG RR intervals (RMSSD-HRV) at 0-beat delay. Sympathetic BRS for SVR strongly correlated with SVR, CO, and RMSSD-HRV, particularly at 3-beat delay, and was uniquely associated with SAP at 1-beat delay. Sympathetic BRS for dP/dtmax correlated with dP/dtmax at 1-beat delay. In contrast, BRS for CO correlated with CO and SVR at 0- and 3-beat delays. Postural changes mainly affected parasympathetically-mediated BRS for IBI and, to a lesser extent, the sympathetic vascular and myocardial branches. Conclusions: This method effectively captures multiple baroreflex responses and their temporal dynamics, revealing distinct autonomic mechanisms and the impact of postural changes. Further validation is warranted."]},

However, evidence regarding regional muscle activation remains controversial, primarily because information derived solely from surface electromyograms (sEMG) amplitude does not necessarily provide an accurate estimate of neural drive to the muscle. To address this limitation, this study investigated whether there are proximodistal differences in the motor unit properties of the biceps femoris long head during isometric hip extension and knee flexion tasks. Methods: Seventeen resistance-trained males performed isometric knee flexion and hip extension tasks at 20% and 40% of maximal voluntary contraction. High-density sEMG were recorded from the proximal and distal regions of the biceps femoris long head and decomposed into individual motor units. Central motor unit properties (mean discharge rate, discharge rate variability, recruitment and de-recruitment thresholds) and peripheral properties (motor unit action potential amplitude and conduction velocity) were analyzed. Bipolar sEMG amplitude was also calculated for each region to simulate traditional sEMG measurements. Results: Bipolar sEMG amplitude, motor unit action potential amplitude and conduction velocity were significantly greater in the distal region during both tasks. In contrast, no proximodistal differences were observed in central motor unit properties. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the increased bipolar sEMG amplitude in the distal region of the biceps femoris long head is driven by peripheral motor unit properties rather than differences in central modulation, likely influenced by intra-muscular variations in muscle mechanics. This emphasizes the limitations of relying solely on sEMG amplitude to infer neural control strategies."]},

Here, we have investigated the effect of human ERG1A (HERG) on [Ca2+]i in C2C12 myotubes, using Fura-2 calcium assays, immunoblot, RT-qPCR, and electrophysiology.  We hypothesized that HERG would modulate L-type calcium channel activity, specifically the Cav1.1 channel known to carry signal from the sarcoplasmic membrane of skeletal muscle to the sarcomeres of the myofibrils.  However, we find that HERG has no effect on the amplitude of L-type channel current nor does it affect the mRNA levels nor protein abundance of the Cav1.1 channel.  Instead we find that, although the rise in [Ca2+]i  (induced by depolarization) is greater in myotubes over-expressing HERG relative to controls, the difference between the KCl-stimulated Ca2+ increase in control and HERG over-expressing cells cannot be accounted for by L-type channel mediated Ca2+ influx, which suggests that HERG could modulate excitation coupled calcium entry (ECCE).  Indeed, the HERG-enhanced increase in [Ca2+]i induced by depolarization is blocked by 2-APB, an inhibitor of ECCE (and SOCE).  Further, we show data suggesting that HERG also modulates the activity of ryanodine receptors, a component of ECCE, as well as store operated calcium entry (SOCE).  Therefore, we investigated the effect of HERG on calsequestrin1, a calcium buffering/binding protein known to modulate ryanodine receptor 1 and store operated Ca2+ entry activities.  Indeed, we find that calsequestrin1 mRNA levels are decreased 0.83-fold (p<0.05) and the total protein abundance is lowered 77% (p<0.05) in myotubes over-expressing HERG relative to controls.  In summary, the data show that ERG1A overexpression modulates [Ca2+]i in skeletal muscle cells by lowering the abundance of the calcium buffering/binding protein calsequestrin1."]},

Mitochondria, crucial for stress adaptation and energy production, may link psychosocial stress to its biological effects, especially during pregnancy when energy demands significantly increase. This study explores two mitochondrial markers-circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf-mtDNA) and Growth Differentiation Factor-15 (GDF15)-as potential mitochondrial health indicators linking maternal distress to pregnancy outcomes in two longitudinal studies from the USA and Turkey.\nMethods: We analyzed biological, demographic, and psychological data from women in two pregnancy studies: EPI (N=187, USA, Mean age=29.6(SD=6.2) and BABIP (N=198, Turkey, Mean age=32.4(SD=4.0)). Data were collected at multiple time points during the perinatal period, including late 2nd and 3rd trimester, with EPI also including additional data at early 2nd trimester and 4-14 months postpartum. Prenatal maternal psychological distress was measured as perceived stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Plasma cf-mtDNA and GDF15 levels were assessed using qPCR and ELISA, respectively. Statistical analyses included Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, Spearman correlations, and Mann-Whitney tests.\nResults: Plasma cf-mtDNA levels did not change significantly during pregnancy in either study. Plasma GDF15 levels increased from early to late pregnancy in both studies and significantly decreased postpartum in EPI. Perinatal maternal distress in the late 2nd and 3rd trimesters was not associated with cf-mtDNA or GDF15 in either study. Metabolic distress, measured as higher pre-pregnancy BMI, was negatively correlated with GDF15 in the late 2nd trimester in EPI and showed a similar trend in BABIP. Similarly, higher maternal psychological distress in the early 2nd trimester were associated with lower cf-mtDNA and a trend for lower GDF15 in EPI. Finally, higher pre-pregnancy BMI and maternal distress in late pregnancy were linked to a smaller decline in GDF15 from late pregnancy to postpartum in EPI, suggesting an interaction between metabolic stress, prenatal distress and post-pregnancy physiological recovery. \nConclusions: This study identified distinct patterns of plasma cf-mtDNA and GDF15 levels during the perinatal period across studies from two countries, revealing unique associations between maternal characteristics, prenatal distress, and pregnancy outcomes, suggesting that maternal distress can interact with energy mobilization during pregnancy."]},

Quantification of contact patterns is crucial to parametrize dynamic transmission models and to provide insights on the (basic) reproduction number. Information on social interactions, can (for instance) be obtained from population-based contact surveys, such as the European Commission project POLYMOD. Estimation of age-specific contact rates from these studies is often done using a piecewise constant approach or bivariate smoothing techniques. For the latter, typically, smoothing is done in the dimensions of the respondent’s and contact’s age. We propose a new flexible strategy based on a smoothing constrained approach - taking into account the reciprocal nature of contacts - where the contact rates are assumed smooth from a cohort perspective as well as from the age distribution of contacts. This is achieved by smoothing over the diagonal components (including all subdiagonals) of the social contact matrix. This approach is supported by the fact that people age with time and thus motivates smoothly varying contact rates from a cohort angle. Two approaches that allow for smoothing of social contact data over cohorts are proposed namely, (1) reordering of the diagonal components of the social contact matrix; and (2) reordering of the penalty matrix associated with the diagonal components. Parameter estimation is done in the likelihood framework by using constrained penalized iterative reweighted least squares (C-PIRLS), under Poisson and negative Binomial distributional assumptions for the observed contacts. A simulation study underlines the benefits of cohort-based smoothing based on two scalar measures of performance. Finally, the proposed methods are illustrated on the Belgian POLYMOD data of 2006.

The transient nature of regulatory phosphorylation events and lack of transgenic ISR reporter mouse lines make visually capturing the molecular hallmarks of ISR activation in specific cell types especially difficult.

In cultured rat cardiomyocytes, CASK knockdown increased localization of connexin 43 (Cx43) and PKP2 at IDs, resulting in increased contact stiffness. In PKP2+/- hIPS-CMs, CASK expression was increased. CASK depletion in these cells promoted PKP2 accumulation at cell contacts, formation of desmosome-like structures, and stress resistance.

Notably, the ablation of PS2 results in increased PS1 expression, particularly in microglial cells, highlighting the importance of PS2. Additionally, neuronal differentiation of two neuroblastoma lines, caused changes in protein expression levels resulting in similar expression profiles of PS1 and PS2, with PS2 levels being higher than PS1. Understanding PS expression profiles is crucial for distinguishing between PS1- and PS2-mediated γ-secretase activity and for developing γ-secretase-targeted therapeutics with improved selectivity."]},

Despite its advantages, this system still struggles with soluble expression of recombinant proteins. To address this, various solubility-enhancing and yield-improving methods such as the addition of fusion tags have been developed. However, traditional tags such as small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) and Glutathione S-transferase (GST) can interfere with protein folding or require removal post-translation, which adds complexity and cost to production. To circumvent these issues, smaller solubility tags (<10 kDa) are preferred. This study specifically focuses on an 11-amino acid solubility-enhancing tag (NT11) derived from the N-terminal domain of a duplicated carbonic anhydrase from Dunaliella species. Results: A comprehensive analysis was performed to improve the characteristics of the 11-amino acid tag. By investigating the alanine-scan library of NT11, we increased its activity and identified key residues for further development. Screening with the alanine mutant library consistently led to at least a two-fold improvement in protein yield for three different proteins. We also discovered that the NT11 tag is not limited to the N-terminal position and can function at either the N- or C-terminal of the protein, providing flexibility in designing protein expression constructs. With these new insights, we have successfully doubled the recombinant protein yields of valuable growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and an originally low-yielding human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), in E. coli. Conclusion: The further characterisation and development of the NT11 tag have provided valuable insights into the optimization process for such small tags and expanded our understanding of its potential applications. The ability of NT11 tag to be positioned at different locations within the protein construct without compromising its effectiveness to enhance recombinant protein yields, makes it a valuable tool across a diverse range of proteins. Collectively, these findings have the potential to simplify and enhance the efficiency of recombinant protein production."]},

Cells in G1 undergo a transient nuclear peak of glutathione (GSH) prior to coordinated entry into S phase followed by rapid divisions and cellular reprogramming. A symplastic block of the ground tissue impairs regeneration, which is rescued by exogenous GSH.

Recreating these intricate behaviors using well-defined molecules remains a major challenge at the intersection of biology, physics, and molecular engineering. Although the polymerization force of the actin cytoskeleton is characterized as a primary driver of cell motility, recapitulating this process in protocellular systems has proven elusive. The difficulty lies in the daunting task of distilling key components from motile cells and integrating them into model membranes in a physiologically relevant manner. To address this, we developed a method to optically control actin polymerization with high spatiotemporal precision within cell-mimetic lipid vesicles known as giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Within these active protocells, the reorganization of actin networks triggered outward membrane extensions as well as the unidirectional movement of GUVs at speeds of up to 0.43 μm/min, comparable to typical adherent mammalian cells. Notably, our findings reveal a synergistic interplay between branched and linear actin forms in promoting membrane protrusions, highlighting the cooperative nature of these cytoskeletal elements.

Using super-resolution microscopy combined with spatial distribution analysis, here we describe that SMC5/6-mediated confinement of negative supercoils lies at the basis of releasing them by topoisomerase Top2A. Along with DNA replication, SMC5/6 progressively associates with chromatin and locally increases the density of supercoil clusters behind the fork, allowing Top2A to efficiently target and release the accumulated supercoils. These processes are essential to complete DNA replication prior to mitosis and therefore to ensure genome stability.

Hydration and viscosity of secreted mucus was measured through air surface liquid and particle tracking microrheology. \nMain results and the role of chance: Endocervical cells treated with CFTR inhibitor Inh-172 demonstrated dehydrated, thicker mucus secretions compared to control (p<.01).  \nLimitations, reasons for caution: In vitro models do not fully recapitulate cellular mucus secretions. \nWider implications of the findings: Cervical mucus plays an important role in fertility regulation. Our studies suggest that CFTR may be an important mediator of those changes and provide experimental evidence for the infertility phenotype seen in women with cystic fibrosis. Additionally, assays used in these studies are useful endpoints for studying cervical mucus regulation in vitro."]},

Endomembrane trafficking and phragmoplast remodelling are tightly coupled, indicating the existence of active crosstalk. However, although many molecular regulators of membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal organisation are known, it remains poorly understood how these processes are co-ordinated.

Composite plants consisting of wild-type shoots and transgenic roots are an alternative method for generating transgenic plant tissues that can facilitate functional analysis of genes-of-interest involved in root development or root-microbe interactions. In this report, we introduce a novel set of GATEWAY-compatible vectors that enable a wide range of molecular biology uses in roots of soybean composite plants. These vectors incorporate in-frame epitope fusions of green fluorescent protein, 3x-HA, or miniTurbo-ID, which can be easily fused to a gene-of-interest using the GATEWAY cloning system. Moreover, these vectors allow for the identification of transgenic roots using either mCherry fluorescence or the RUBY marker. We demonstrate the functionality of these vectors by expressing subcellular markers in soybean, providing evidence of their effectiveness in generating protein fusions in composite soybean plants. Furthermore, we show how these vectors can be used for gene function analysis by expressing the bacterial effector, AvrPphB in composite roots, enabling the identification of soybean targets via immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. Additionally, we demonstrate the successful expression of stable miniTurbo-ID fusion proteins in composite roots.

Understanding the process by which healthy cells become senescent and develop SASP factors is critical for improving the identification of senescent cells and, ultimately, understanding tissue dysfunction. Here, we reveal how the duration of cellular stress modulates the SASP in distinct subpopulations of senescent cells. We used multiplex, single-cell imaging to build a proteomic map of senescence induction in human epithelial cells induced to senescence over the course of 31 days. We map how the expression of SASP proteins increases alongside other known senescence markers such as p53, p21, and p16INK4a. The aggregated population of cells responded to etoposide with an accumulation of stress response factors over the first 11 days, followed by a plateau in most proteins. At the single-cell level, however, we identified two distinct senescence cell populations, one defined primarily by larger nuclear area and the second by higher protein concentrations. Trajectory inference suggested that cells took one of two discrete molecular paths from unperturbed healthy cells, through a common transitional subpopulation, and ending at the discrete terminal senescence phenotypes. Our results underscore the importance of using single-cell proteomics to identify the mechanistic pathways governing the transition from senescence induction to a mature state of senescence characterized by the SASP."]},

To this end, we investigated the mechanical response of the Arabidopsis leaf epidermis to stretching. The epidermis exhibited a non-linear stiffening behavior that naturally fell into three regimes. Each regime also corresponded with distinct nonlinear behaviors in terms of transverse deformation (i.e., Poisson effect) and unrecoverable deformation (i.e., plasticity). We found that these properties arise not from the geometric structure of the epidermal cells but rather from the cell wall material, which behaves as a fibrous network material. Using a five-beam model, we demonstrated that these nonlinear behaviors result from the transition from reorientation and bendingdominated to stretch-dominated deformation modes of cellulose microfibrils. We further explored how these mechanical properties change during development and found stiffening behavior is more pronounced at later developmental stage. Finally, our investigation into the ", " mutant with altered morphology shows that it has anisotropic mechanical properties, likely contributing to the leaf curvature.

For example, the type II secretion system (T2SS) releases toxins, proteases, lipases and carbohydrate-degrading enzymes into the extracellular environment to promote tissue softening and soft rot. In this way, the T2SS promotes virulence of phytopathogenic Gram-negative bacteria.  However, the role of the T2SS and its substrates for vascular disease remains enigmatic. Here, we show that the Xps-T2SS allows Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) to breach the tissue barrier between hydathodes - the initial bacterial entry point - and xylem thereby gaining access to the leaf vasculature. Yet, Xps-T2SS was dispensable for bacterial multiplication in the leaf apoplast or inside the hydathode cavity suggesting a role beyond plant defense suppression or nutrient acquisition. Using comparative genomics, four plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) were found to be associated with vascular pathogenesis. Testing gene knockout combinations of those enzymes revealed that virulence of only the quadruple CWDE mutant was down to the level of the xps-T2SS mutant. Our results thus demonstrate that the Xps-T2SS and a set of CWDEs that is likely secreted by this system allow Xcc to break this tissue barrier enabling long-distance mobility of Xcc inside the host plant. We thus expand our understanding on how certain bacterial pathogens have specialized towards vascular pathogens."]},

The aim of the research was to determine the resistance of sunflower hybrids to the broomrape parasite. During the research, a vegetation experiment was used to determine the racial composition of the parasite and the resistance of different sunflower hybrids to it. Sunflower hybrids were evaluated for resistance to broomrape in soil culture using a modified method and the roll method of seed germination. From the northern Steppe of Ukraine, broomrape is actively moving to the central, northern and western regions of the country. The practical value of the work is to determine the resistance of sunflower hybrids to broomrape. Differentiation of sunflower hybrids grown by resistance to the parasite was carried out. It has been observed that the broomrape population exhibits a significant level of virulence capable of overcoming the immunity found in the most resilient foreign-bred hybrids resistant to E, F, and G races of this parasite. The appearance of highly aggressive new races of broomrape (E, F, G, and H) in the Forest-Steppe and Polissya regions underscores the crucial necessity to address the challenge of developing breeding material resistant to these novel races of the parasitic plant. This entails an in-depth exploration of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying sunflower resistance to the pathogen. The widespread buildup of parasite races E, F, G, and H in sunflower crops is linked to the disruption of crop rotations and the extensive cultivation of hybrids of this crop. These hybrids are primarily resistant to races 5 (E) and 6 (F) of the parasite. The results of the research can be used in the region's farms for successful protection against broomrape, as well as in breeding programs to create sunflower hybrids resistant to new races of the parasite and corn hybrids that cause better germination of seeds of this pathogen in the soil and their death by their root secretions.

Its extraordinary biological and chemical resistance has defied efforts to elucidate its chemical composition and structure. This led to the adoption of broad and imprecise definitions of SP, which encouraged claims for its widespread occurrence among diverse embryophyte and non-embryophyte taxa and also misguided research on the evolution of SP and its roles during terrestrialisation. We previously proposed a more precise biochemical definition that can be used as a diagnostic tool to distinguish genuine SP from other chemically resistant cell wall materials. The definition was centred on the possession of ASCL (Anther-Specific Chalcone synthase-Like), an embryophyte-specific enzyme of the polyketide pathway that provides precursors for SP biosynthesis. Herein, we demonstrate that all five enzymes (CYP703, CYP704, ACOS, ASCL and TKPR) of the polyketide pathway are present in embryophytes but absent in green algae and propose a new, more comprehensive definition of SP: “Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant complex heteropolymer present in the outer walls of spores and pollen grains and is composed partly of hydroxylated polyketides derived from the conserved polyketide pathway, which typically involves CYP703A, CYP704B, ACOS, ASCL and TKPR.” Furthermore, we examine the evolution of all five enzymes of the polyketide pathway from ancestral enzymes of primary metabolism. We discuss the co-selection of ACOS, ASCL and TKPR and also provide evidence that gene dosage of all five genes in the pathway has been subjected to strict evolutionary control. This study further signifies SP as an evolutionary innovation unique to the embryophyte lineage and encourages research on possible evolutionary relationships between genuine embryophyte SP and other ‘SP-like materials’ in reproductive bodies including algal zygospores and dinoflagellate cysts."]},

This may be attributable to the difficulty in identifying the best individuals for transplantation/relocation in conservation efforts or identification of the best parents in breeding programs. To explore the use of EAA and GEA for future breeding programs, we used a cereal crop - barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) as our case-study species due to its wide adaptability to different environments and agro-ecologies, ranging from marginal and low input fields to high-productive farms. Here, we use publicly available data to conduct environmental genomic selection (EGS) on 753 landrace barley accessions using a mini-core of 31 landrace accessions and a de-novo core of 100 as the training populations. Environmental genomic selection is to environmental association analysis (EAA) what genomic selection is to genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Since local adaptation to the environment is polygenic, a whole-genome approach is likely to be more accurate for selecting for environmental adaptation.

We investigated how wax quantity and composition are modulated over time and in response to different environmental stressors, as well as the molecular and genetic mechanisms involved in such. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and photographic results showed that sorghum leaf sheath wax load and composition were altered in mature plants grown under drought and simulated shade, though this phenomenon appears to vary by sorghum cultivar. We combined an in vitro wax induction protocol with GC-MS and RNA-seq measurements to identify a draft signaling pathway for wax bloom induction in sorghum. We also explored the potential of spectrophotometry to aid in monitoring wax bloom dynamics. Spectrophotometric analysis showed primary differences in reflectance between bloom-rich and bloomless tissue surfaces in the 230-500nm range of the spectrum, corresponding to the blue color channel of photographic data. Our smartphone-based system detected significant differences in wax production between control and shade treatment groups, demonstrating its potential for candidate screening. Overall, our data suggest that wax extrusion can be rapidly modulated in response to light, occurring within days compared to the months required for the changes observed under greenhouse drought/simulated shade conditions.

The larger network of ABA signaling factors includes additional kinases and E3 ligases that modify these components to affect their activity and stability. The ABI5-Binding Proteins (AFPs) are negative regulators of ABA response. This study shows that the AFPs interact with specific family members of all components of this pathway and are substrates for SnRK2s and PP2Cs. AFPs also interact with subsets of MAP kinases (MPKs) and 14-3-3 proteins previously found to regulate activity of the ABI5-related clade of transcription factors. Residues predicted to be phosphorylated are conserved between AFPs, but are located within regions predicted to be unstructured.

Given the complex structure of plants, with thin objects like leaves and stems overlapping, reconstructing accurate 3D point clouds presents significant challenges. One of these is occlusion, where points in the 3D point cloud cannot be obtained due to overlapping parts, preventing accurate point capture. Another is the generation of erroneous points in non-existent locations due to image matching errors along object outlines. The MMM mitigates these problems through an iterative process that alternates between locally generating point clouds and refining these point clouds by removing erroneous points using mask images. The proposed pipeline enables the construction of plant 3D point clouds with minimal noise and fewer missing points.

The wild-type strain B. methanolicus MGA3 naturally overproduces L-glutamate in methanol-based fed-batch fermentations.\nResults\nHere we generated, by induced mutagenesis, an evolved B. methanolicus strain exhibiting enhanced L-glutamate production capability (>150%). To showcase the potential of this evolved strain, further metabolic engineering enabled the production of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) directly from L-glutamate, with a yield of 13.2 g/L from methanol during fed-batch fermentations. By using a systems-level analysis, encompassing whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, fluxome analysis and genome-scale metabolic modelling, we were able to elucidate the metabolic and regulatory adaptations that sustain the biosynthesis of these products. The metabolism of the mutant strain evolved to prioritize energy conservation and efficient carbon utilization. Key metabolic shifts include the downregulation of energy-intensive processes such as flagellation and motility and the rerouting of carbon fluxes towards α-ketoglutarate and its derivative, L-glutamate. Moreover, we observed that transformation of the evolved strain with a GABA biosynthesis plasmid had a positive effect on L-glutamate production, likely due to an upregulation of various transaminases involved in the L-glutamate biosynthesis from α-ketoglutarate.\nConclusions\nThese results and insights provide a foundation for further rational metabolic engineering and bioprocess optimization, enhancing the industrial viability of B. methanolicus for sustainable production of L-glutamate and its derivatives."]},

Despite this, the literature reveals a gap in generalising these effects to specific classroom activities, partly arising from the absence of suitable instruments to measure emotions in situational educational scenarios. Our study introduces an experience sampling method to measure sixteen discrete emotional states, deriving two scales for positive and negative activating emotions. Grounded in psychological and neuroscientific theories that integrate emotion with cognition, our research explores the interplay between prior knowledge, preservice teachers’ anticipatory situational emotions, and subsequent learning in an experimental science education context. Analysing data from 269 preservice teachers from diverse backgrounds (STEM and non-STEM) at the upper-secondary level, we found that negative activating emotions are often rooted in non-STEM backgrounds and exacerbated by limited prior science knowledge. These negative emotions impact achievement and learning primarily through the mediating role of boredom. Furthermore, our results indicate that the detrimental impact of boredom on achievement is significantly influenced by prior knowledge, with a more pronounced effect on students with lower levels. Given that emotions are amenable to intervention, our findings propose that specifically addressing boredom in students with low prior knowledge could amplify the benefits of educational strategies."]},

In this work, we focused on the T7 production system in E. coli BL21, a prime example of a burdensome gene circuit, to investigate the main cause for this gene expression heterogeneity and methods to mitigate it. Based on continuous cultivation analyzed and control by automated flow cytometry, we quantified the trade-off between cellular growth and gene expression and tracked the cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression (measured as entropy). We concluded that the growth reduction associated to the activation of the burdensome gene circuit, i.e., the switching cost, is at the origin of the population heterogeneity. The loss of growth rate imposed by the burdensome activation of the gene is compensated at the population level by the overgrowth of less induced cells that safeguard the population by generating entropy. We tried to homogenize the population by pulsing the inducer with increasing frequency but found that the population escapes control through promoter mutation, leading to a genotype exhibiting reduced gene expression, but also, reduced entropy. To engineer a more homogeneous population without sacrificing gene expression, we decreased the switching cost associated to the induction by lowering the quality of the main carbon source. This strategy successfully led to a more homogeneous and productive population. Our approach allows for a precise quantification of the trade-off between growth and gene expression in cell population cultivated under dynamic conditions and highlights the importance of the switching cost for designing efficient approaches of cell population control."]},

However, invading microbes rarely find novel territories uninhabited. In such a scenario, resident microbes can interact with the newcomers and, in many cases, impede their invasion, an effect known as biotic resistance. Accordingly, invasions are shaped by the interplay between dispersal and resistance. However, these two factors are difficult to disentangle or manipulate in natural systems, making their interplay difficult to understand. To address this challenge, we tracked microbial invasions in the lab over space and time, first in a model system of two interacting microbes, then in a multi-strain system involving a pathogen invading resident communities. In the presence of biotic resistance, we observed three qualitatively different invasion regimes: consistent, pulsed, and pinned, where, in the third regime, strong biotic resistance stalled the invasion entirely despite ongoing invader dispersal. Surprisingly, these rich invasion dynamics could be qualitatively predicted with a simple, parameter-free framework that ignores individual species interactions, even for rather complex communities. Moreover, we showed that this simple framework could accurately predict simulated invasions from different mechanistic models, indicating its broad applicability. Our work offers a thorough understanding of how biotic resistance impacts invasions and introduces a predictive tool to identify invasion-resistant communities."]},

The model shows that the cycles represent internally generated relaxation oscillations, which emerge when fast resource dynamics with positive feedback drive slow changes in strain abundance. Our findings highlight the critical role of resource dynamics and feedback in shaping population cycles in microbial communities and have implications for biotechnology."]},

Having a diverse department is beneficial for undergraduate and graduate students as representation of underrepresented minority groups in the professoriate can inspire a greater diversity of students to pursue higher levels of education or research-focused careers. Increased diversity benefits research directly as diverse teams have been shown to have better ideas and outcomes. In 2020, our department had lower gender diversity than would be expected based on the pool of PhD students and post-doctoral fellows in Canada. Therefore, we altered our hiring process, primarily by redacting applications, for recruitment into entry-level tenure-track faculty positions. With this change in process, female hires increased from 17% in the previous ten years (5 hires) to 80% in the subsequent four years (5 hires) with no substantial change in hiring of racially diverse individuals (50% to 40%). Overall, combined with retirements, the percentage of female faculty in the department went from 25% to 50% and the percentage of racialized faculty went from 38% to 44%. The new hires have met or exceeded expectations of success with respect to grant funding and are on track to meet or exceed expectations for other metrics of success. Thus, our intervention was very successful in increasing the diversity of our department within a short timeframe. We believe that our experience could provide other departments with a template for making substantive change, even in the absence of internal expertise in the area."]},

Dysregulation of this system has been implicated in genetic diseases and cancers affecting diverse tissues. To better understand the regulation of this system, we employed information flow analysis based on transfer entropy (TE) between the activation dynamics of two key elements in cells stimulated with EGF: SOS, a guanine nucleotide exchanger for the small GTPase RAS, and RAF, a RAS effector serine/threonine kinase. TE analysis allows for model-free assessment of the timing, direction, and strength of the information flow regulating the system response. We detected significant amounts of TE in both directions between SOS and RAF, indicating feedback regulation. Importantly, the amount of TE did not simply follow the input dose or the intensity of the causal reaction, demonstrating the uniqueness of TE. TE analysis proposed regulatory networks containing multiple tracks and feedback loops and revealed temporal switching in the reaction pathway primarily responsible for reaction control. This proposal was confirmed by the effects of a MEK inhibitor on TE. Furthermore, TE analysis identified the functional disorder of a SOS mutation associated with Noonan syndrome, a human genetic disease, of which the pathogenic mechanism has not been precisely known yet.

In Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), considerable evidence shows that the dynamics between residual leukemia and the patient’s immune system can result in either sustained disease control, leading to treatment-free remission (TFR), or disease recurrence. The question remains how to integrate mechanistic and data-driven models to support prediction of treatment outcomes. Starting from classical ecological modeling concepts, which allow to explicitly account for immune interactions at the cellular level, we incorporate time-course data on natural killer (NK) cell number, function, and their tumor-induced suppression into a model of CML treatment. We identify relevant time scales governing treatment and immune response, enabling refined model calibration using tumor and NK cell time courses from different datasets. While the model successfully describes patient-specific response dynamics, critical parameters for predicting treatment outcome remain uncertain. However, by explicitly incorporating tumor load changes in response to TKI dose alterations, these parameters can be estimated and used to derive model predictions for treatment cessation. Further exploring dynamic changes in the number of functional immune cells, we suggest specific measurement strategies of immune effector cell populations to enhance prediction accuracy for CML recurrence following treatment cessation. The generalizability and flexibility of our approach represent a significant step towards quantitative, personalized medicine that integrates tumor-immune dynamics to guide clinical decisions and optimize dynamic cancer therapies."]},

The micromere of the sea urchin embryo may serve as one of those examples: An ACD at the 16-cell stage forms micromeres unique to echinoids among echinoderms. We previously reported that a polarity factor, Activator of G-protein Signaling (AGS), plays a crucial role in micromere formation. However, AGS and its associated ACD factors are present in all echinoderms and across most metazoans, leaving a question of what evolutionary modification of AGS protein or its surrounding molecular environment contributed to the evolutionary acquisition of micromeres only in echinoids. In this study, we learned that the GoLoco motifs at the AGS C-terminus play critical roles in regulating micromere formation in sea urchin embryos. Further, other echinoderms AGS or chimeric AGS that contain the C-terminus of AGS orthologs from various organisms showed varied localization and function in micromere formation. In contrast, the sea star or the pencil urchin orthologs of other ACD factors were consistently localized at the vegetal cortex in the sea urchin embryo, suggesting that AGS may be a unique variable factor that facilitates ACD diversity among echinoderms. Consistently, sea urchin AGS appears to facilitate micromere-like cell formation and accelerate the enrichment timing of the germline factor Vasa during early embryogenesis of the pencil urchin, an ancestral type of sea urchin. Based on these observations, we propose that the molecular evolution of a single polarity factor facilitates ACD diversity while preserving the core ACD machinery among echinoderms and beyond during evolution."]},

Despite epidermal microstructures on the fins of other benthic fishes, little exploration of pectoral fin surfaces at the microscopic scale has been undertaken in sculpins. Using scanning electron microscopy, we discovered microscopic, fibrillar projections contained within single cells on the ventral surfaces of the paired fin rays of two intertidal and two subtidal species of marine sculpins. In contrast to subtidal species, the intertidal species possessed epidermal cells with discrete channels separating groups of fibrillar projections.

This low output necessitates a better understanding of natural fluctuations in gamete, specifically sperm, quality in captive individuals. To generate an understanding of natural gametic cycles in captive PRCTs, we administered male PRCTs (n = 86) housed under natural temperature and photoperiod cycles with exogenous hormones monthly for one year. Samples were analyzed for motility and concentration to assess variations in sperm quality by month. Spermiation was successfully stimulated every month, but quality fluctuated; sperm motility was highest in June and July, while sperm concentration was highest in December, January, and March. These results indicate that, while hormones can be utilized to stimulate gamete production in PRCTs year-round, sperm quality is not consistent. Furthermore, the seasonal occurrence of peak sperm production of captive males differed from natural peaks reported for wild PRCTs. Our results illustrate the need for more biologically informed strategies for breeding of at-risk anuran populations."]},

Near-infrared spectroscopical technologies have proved to be promising for application in the integrative taxonomy of insects, and it is a true-non-destructive method, causing no damage to the sample and being completely chemical-preparation-free. Near-infrared spectral profiles are known as the fingerprints of the chemical composition of a given sample, and a new layer of information may be accessed. Hyperspectral imaging technologies in the near-infrared range are among the most popular, although their usage is still incipient in insect studies. As in other animal taxa, katydids' taxonomy has traditionally been based on morphological comparison, resulting in many misclassifications over the years. However, integrative methods are more and more required in taxonomic studies. Different methods and technologies have been used from an integrative perspective to minimize misidentifications, especially for non-taxonomist or untrained researchers. Here, we approach the applicability of near-infrared spectroscopy coupled with hyperspectral imaging technology to Ensifera specimens housed in collections, discussing the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges to future applications. As a result, we propose using only homologous body parts in comparing and modeling species using this kind of data due to the heterogeneity of the insects' exoskeleton. Additionally, we made a case study by discriminating four species of the katydid genus Conocephalus Thunberg, one of the most speciose genera within Orthoptera that is known to have polymorphic species, with variations expressed in the wing development and postabdomen appendages. We generated a Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) classification model for the species with an overall classification accuracy for the assigned pixels of 90% and specific accuracy for pixel discrimination ranging from 96% to 98%.

Furthermore, in tropical sheep and goat breeds, water hyacinth can replace up to 37.5% of the commercial concentrate used for growth and fattening, but it has a major comparative effect on sheep. Feed prices for the T4 group fed sheep and goats were 37.2% and 36.8% lower, respectively, than for the T1 group.

By overexpressing or knocking down expression of c-di-AMP synthase genes, we made strains producing different levels of c-di-AMP, which we linked to changes in secondary differentiation status. Increases in c-di-AMP resulted in an earlier increase in transcription of EB-associated genes, and this was further manifested in earlier production of EBs. In contrast, when c-di-AMP levels were decreased, secondary differentiation was delayed. Based on these data, we conclude there is a threshold level of c-di-AMP needed to trigger secondary differentiation in Chlamydia.

Constantly secreted into the lumen of the intestine, IgA binds commensal microbiota to regulate their colonization and function(2,3) with unclear implications for health. IgA deficiency is common in humans but is difficult to study due to its complex aetiology and comorbidities(4-8). Using genetically and environmentally controlled mice, here we show that IgA-deficient animals have increased susceptibility to endogenous colorectal tumours. Cellular and molecular analyses revealed that, in the absence of IgA, colonic epithelial cells induce antibacterial factors and accelerate cell cycling in response to the microbiota. Oral treatment with IgA was sufficient to both reduce steady-state proliferation and protect mice from tumours, but this function was due to antibody structure rather than binding specificity. In both organoid and monolayer culture systems, IgA directly suppressed epithelial growth. Co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and a targeted CRISPR screen identified DMBT1 as an IgA-binding epithelial surface protein required for IgA-mediated suppression of proliferation. Together, IgA and DMBT1 regulate Notch signalling and tune the normal cycling of absorptive colonocyte progenitors. In mice, deleting the transmembrane and cytoplasmic signalling portions of DMBT1 or blocking Notch signalling was sufficient to reverse both the increased proliferation and tumour susceptibility of IgA knockouts. These experiments establish a homeostatic function for IgA in tempering physiological epithelial responses to microbiota to maintain mucosal health."]},

It differentiates between two functional and morphological forms: elementary body (EB) and reticulate body (RB). The signals that trigger differentiation from one form to the other are unknown. EBs and RBs have distinctive characteristics that distinguish them, including their size, infectivity, proteome, and transcriptome. Intriguingly, they also differ in their overall redox status as EBs are oxidized and RBs are reduced. We hypothesize that alterations in redox may serve as a trigger for secondary differentiation. To test this, we examined the function of the primary antioxidant enzyme alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (AhpC), a well-known member of the peroxiredoxins family, in chlamydial growth and development. Based on our hypothesis, we predicted that altering the expression of ahpC would modulate chlamydial redox status and trigger earlier or delayed secondary differentiation. To test this, we created ahpC overexpression and knockdown strains. During ahpC knockdown, ROS levels were elevated, and the bacteria were sensitive to a broad set of peroxide stresses. Interestingly, we observed increased expression of EB-associated genes and concurrent higher production of EBs at an earlier time in the developmental cycle, indicating earlier secondary differentiation occurs under elevated oxidation conditions. In contrast, overexpression of AhpC created a resistant phenotype against oxidizing agents and delayed secondary differentiation. Together, these results indicate that redox potential is a critical factor in developmental cycle progression.

We hypothesized that a comprehensive examination of the ANS-immune network in patients with HIV, would reveal that the type and severity of autonomic neuropathy (AN) would predict immune phenotypes with distinct clinical and demographic characteristics.    \nMethods: This is a cross-sectional study of 79 adult people with a history of well-controlled HIV on stable combination antiretroviral treatment (CART) recruited from a primary care clinic network within the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. All participants underwent a standardized battery of autonomic function tests summarized as the Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS) and vagal and adrenergic baroreflex sensitivity (BRS-V and BRS-A). Immune profiling included: 1) measurement of interleukin-6 (IL-6) as part of the Olink assay Target 96 Inflammation Panel, 2) non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering analyses on Olink immune biomarkers, and 3) mass cytometry (CyTOF) on a subset of participants with and without autonomic neuropathy (N = 10).  \nResults: Reduced activity of caudal vagal circuitry involved in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) predicted higher levels of IL-6 (Spearman's rho = -0.352, p=0.002). The comprehensive assessment of the ANS-immune network showed four immunotypes defined by NMF analyses. A pro-inflammatory immunotype defined by elevations in type 1 cytokines (IL-6, IL-17) and increased numbers of CD8+ T-cells was associated with autonomic neuropathy (AN). This association was driven by deficits in the cardiovascular sympathetic nervous system and remained strongly significant after controlling for the older age and greater burden of co-morbid illness among participants with this immunotype (aOR=4.7, p=0.017).  \nDiscussion:  Our results provide novel support for the clinical relevance of the CAP in patients with chronic inflammatory AN. These data also provide insight regarding the role of the sympathetic nervous system and aging in the progression and development of co-morbidities in patients with chronic HIV and support future research aimed at developing therapies focused on modulation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic/vagal nervous system."]},

Both i.m. and i.n. vaccines induce potent systemic serum neutralizing antibodies, bone marrow-resident IgG-secreting cells, and splenic T cell responses. The i.n. vaccine additionally induces robust respiratory mucosal immune responses, including SARS-CoV-2-reactive lung-resident memory and lung-homing T cell populations. As a booster following previous i.m. vaccination, the i.n. vaccine also elicits the development of mucosal virus-specific T cells. Both the i.m. and i.n. administered vaccines durably protect hamsters from infection-associated morbidity upon viral challenge, significantly reducing viral loads and preventing challenged hamsters from transmitting virus to naive cagemates. This saRNA-NLC vaccine's potent systemic immunogenicity, and additional mucosal immunogenicity when delivered i.n., may be key for combating SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens."]},

However, it is unclear why some ACPA+ individuals convert to clinical RA while others do not. We explored the possibility in the Targeting Immune Responses for Prevention of Rheumatoid Arthritis (TIP-RA) study that epigenetic remodeling is part of the trajectory from an at-risk state to clinical disease and identifies novel biomarkers associated with conversion to clinical RA.\nMethods\nACPA- Controls, ACPA+ At-Risk, and Early RA individuals were followed for up to 5 years, including obtaining blood samples annually and at RA diagnosis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated into CD19+ B cells, memory CD4+ T cells, and naive CD4+ T cells using antibodies and magnetic beads. Genome-wide methylation within each cell lineage was assayed using the Illumina MethylationEPIC v1.0 beadchip. ACPA+ At-Risk participants who did or did not develop RA were designated Pre-RA or Non-converters, respectively. Differentially methylated loci (DML) were selected using the Limma software package. Using the Caret package, we constructed machine learning models in test and validation cohorts and identified the most predictive loci of clinical RA conversion.\nResults\nCross-sectional differential methylation analysis at baseline revealed DMLs that distinguish the Pre-RA methylome from ACPA+ Non-converters, the latter which closely resembled ACPA- Controls. Genes overlapping these DMLs correspond to aberrant NOTCH signaling and DNA repair pathways in B cells. Longitudinal analysis showed that ACPA- Control and ACPA+ Non-converter methylomes are relatively constant. In contrast, the Pre-RA methylome remodeled along a dynamic RA methylome trajectory characterized by epigenetic changes in active regulatory elements. Clinical conversion to RA, defined based on diagnosis, marked an epigenetic inflection point for cell cycle pathways in B cells and adaptive immunity pathways in naive T cells. Machine learning revealed individual loci associated with RA conversion. This model significantly outperformed autoantibodies plus acute phase reactants as predictors of RA conversion.\nConclusion\nDNA methylation is a dynamic process in ACPA+ individuals at-risk for developing RA that eventually transition to clinical disease. In contrast, non-converters and controls have stable methylomes. The accumulation of epigenetic marks over time prior to conversion to clinical RA conforms to pathways that are associated with immunity and can be used to identify potential pathogenic pathways for therapeutic targeting and/or use as prognostic biomarkers."]},

The analysis used HGVS nomenclature string-match comparisons to assess annotation consistency from each tool, corresponding coding impacts, and associated ACMG criteria inferred from the annotations.\nResults: The analysis revealed variable concordance rates, with 58.52% agreement for HGVSc, 84.04% for HGVSp, and 85.58% for the coding impact.

Here, we longitudinally tracked B cells recognizing WT spike in two individuals of mRNA vaccine, from convalescence of breakthrough infection to acute phase of reinfection. Comprehensive characterization of 632 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from those B cells reveals that mAbs cloned after reinfection have dramatically enhanced neutralizing breadth and potency, including 11 mAbs that potently neutralize all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants from WT to KP.3. Among the 11 mAbs, 5 mAbs are classified into public clonotypes encoded by IGHV3-53 or IGHV3-66, whereas the rest belong to a rarely reported clonotype encoded by IGHV3-74. Notably, IGHV3-74 mAbs can neutralize SARS-CoV-1 with a minimum IC50 of 0.055 μg/ml. Structural and functional analysis further suggests that IGHV3-74 mAbs target a novel epitope on receptor-binding domain and the best mAb, termed KXD352, is highly resilient to variations on this epitope. Overall, this study demonstrates that both public and rare antibody clonotypes primed by prototype mRNA vaccine can achieve extraordinary neutralizing breadth and potency in repeated Omicron infections."]},

However, Xists ability to diffuse under select circumstances has also been documented, leading us to suspect that Xist RNA may have targets and functions beyond the Xi. Here, using female mouse embryonic stem cells (ES) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) as models, we demonstrate that Xist RNA indeed can localize beyond the Xi. However, its binding is limited to approximately 100 genes in cells undergoing XCI (ES cells) and in post-XCI cells (MEFs). The target genes are diverse in function but are unified by their active chromatin status. Xist binds discretely to promoters of target genes in neighborhoods relatively depleted for Polycomb marks, contrasting with the broad, Polycomb-enriched domains reported for human XIST RNA. We find that Xist binding is associated with down-modulation of autosomal gene expression. However, unlike on the Xi, Xist binding does not lead to full silencing and also does not spread beyond the target gene. Over-expressing Xist in transgenic ES cells similarly leads to autosomal gene suppression, while deleting Xists Repeat B motif reduces autosomal binding and perturbs autosomal down-regulation. Furthermore, treating female ES cells with the Xist inhibitor, X1, leads to loss of autosomal suppression. Altogether, our findings reveal that Xist targets ~100 genes beyond the Xi, identify Repeat B as a crucial domain for its in-trans function in mice, and indicate that autosomal targeting can be disrupted by a small molecule inhibitor."]},

Here, we focus on a diseased site (Freycinet Peninsula, Tasmania, Australia) with 18 years of continuous mark-recapture data to test: (1) whether rates of precocial breeding in females continued to increase after the initial rise after the emergence of the disease, (2) whether there was a relationship between body size and breeding success for either one-year-olds or adult females (i.e., at least two-years-old), and (3) whether there was inbreeding depression in breeding success for either age category. We show that rates of precocial breeding did not continue to rise, and that the proportion of precocially breeding females has plateaued at around 50%. We also show that there was no effect of body size on the probability of breeding for either one-year-old or for adult females. Finally, we show that there was no evidence for inbreeding depression in breeding success for either age class.

Building on recent formalizations of this phenomenon, we tackle the computational challenge of exhaustively detecting autocatalytic cycles in reactions networks, and further evaluate the impact of thermodynamic constraints on their realization under mass action kinetics. We first characterize the complexity of the detection problem by proving its NP-completeness. This justifies the use of constraint solvers to list all autocatalytic cycles in a given reaction network, and also to group them into compatible sets, composed of cycles whose stoichiometric requirements are not contradictory. Crucially, we show that the introduction of thermodynamic realism does constrain the composition of these sets. Compatibility relationships among cycles can indeed be disrupted when the reaction kinetics obey thermodynamic consistency throughout the network. On the contrary, these constraints have no impact on the realizability of isolated cycles, unless upper or lower bounds are imposed on the concentrations of the reactants. Overall, by better characterizing the conditions of autocatalysis in complex reaction systems, this work brings us a step closer to assessing the contribution of this collective chemical behavior to the emergence of natural selection in the primordial soup."]},

Our investigation involves estimating species diversity and genome-wide diversity (gauged within three pivotal species) within each trophic level, evaluating seven key ecosystem functions, and analyzing the strength of the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functions (BEFs). We found that, overall, the absolute effect size of genetic diversity on ecosystem functions mirrors that of species diversity in natural ecosystems.

For organisms amenable to controlled crosses, the increased fitness of progeny from between- relative to within-population crosses (heterosis) provides a useful tool to infer historical fixation of partly recessive deleterious alleles by drift and/or bottlenecks. Additionally, heterosis may also provide a unique benefit in regional admixture provenancing for restorations of rare plant species, but empirical data to directly test this idea is lacking.\nMethods\nWe quantified heterosis in crosses between small remnant populations of a rare prairie forb (Silene regia Sims). We measured early fitness components (seed number per fruit, germination, and juvenile survival) in a controlled environment. Adult fitness components (survival and reproduction) were quantified over two flowering seasons in two different environments, a field common garden simulating the initial stages of a restoration, and a greenhouse. To our knowledge, our study is the first to estimate cumulative fitness for a rare species in conditions of a newly established restoration in the field. Additionally, we provide a unique comparison of heterosis estimated under controlled vs. field conditions.\nKey Results\nThe consequences of between-population crosses for cumulative fitness in the field were strongly positive in two of the populations (132-292% heterosis) and neutral in a third. Heterosis was generally stronger when measured under field conditions and was more likely to be detected for adult fitness components.\nConclusions\nRegional admixture provenancing in restorations should be beneficial for this species. We advocate for more research on heterosis in rare species, particularly in restorations. Such restorations can be opportunities for experimental genetics in addition to reestablishing important ecosystem services."]},

Four mRNA datasets (GSE4745, GSE125451, GSE173975, and GSE80174) downloaded from GEO repository were used in this study. Using limma, a total of 284 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in T1DM, of which 11 were upregulated and 9 were downregulated. GSEA showed that these DEGs were significantly enriched in cell communication, lipid metabolic process, and PPAR signaling. A total of 584 DEGs were identified in TBI, of which 186 were upregulated and 9 were downregulated. GSEA showed that these DEGs were mainly enriched in immune response-regulating signaling pathway. WGCNA identified 122 significant genes in TIDM-related modules and 368 significant genes in TBI-related module. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that T1DM module genes were significantly correlated with lipid metabolic process and ribosome biogenesis, while TBI module genes were significantly correlated with inflammation and immune response, including leukocyte mediated immunity, lymphocyte mediated immunity, and cytokine mediated receptor activity. PPI network analysis of T1DM module genes identified 20 hub genes, including 14 ribosomal genes: Rpl23, Rps3a, Rps6, Rpl5, Rpl17, Rps24, Rpl23a, Rps4x, Rpl9, Rps15a14, Rpl30, Rpl31, Rps25, and Rps27a-2.

Functional enrichment analysis showed that they were primarily enriched in the cellular response to hydroperoxide, cytokine-mediated receptor signaling activity, regulation of sequestering of triglyceride, negative regulation of IL-12 production, and positive regulation of macrophage chemotaxis. Using Reactome, Cmklr1, Mgst1, and Plin2 were related to cytokine signaling activity, neutrophil degranulation, and lipid storage, respectively. We concluded that Lipid droplet dysregulation and Neuroinflammation are the potential molecular mechanisms of T1DM-associated TBI. Cmklr1, Mgst1, and Plin2 are positively correlated with T1DM-associated TBI and may be important biomarkers and potential treatment targets for diabetic TBI."]},

Here, we study theoretically and experimentally the evolution of mutation rates in proofreading polymerases with orthogonal control of direct and indirect selection. Mutagenic DNA polymerases enjoy a long-time fitness advantage by enhancing the rate of acquiring beneficial mutations. However, this is offset by a short-time fitness penalty, which we trace to a counterintuitive trade-off between mutation rates and activity in proofreading polymerases. Since these fitness effects act on different timescales, no one number characterizes the fitness of a mutator allele.

Key findings include lineage-specific expansions in carbohydrate-active enzyme families (AA4 in Nectriaceae, CE4 in Ophiostomataceae, and GH3 in Ophiostomataceae and Ceratocystidaceae), suggesting potential enhancement or loss of lignin modification, hemicellulose deacetylation, and cellulose degradation in different ambrosia lineages. Repeat-Induced Point mutation analysis revealed family-specific patterns rather than lifestyle-associated differences. These results highlight the diverse genomic strategies employed by ambrosia fungi, demonstrating that symbiont evolution can proceed through refined, lineage-specific changes rather than genome-wide, or convergent alterations. Our study suggests that unlike other insect-farmed fungi, ambrosia fungi are not domesticated crops, but rather free-living fungi which co-opted wood boring beetles as vectors via subtle, lineage-specific adaptations."]},

However, despite their central role in evolution little is known about the factors that contribute to the structure, size, formation rate, and fitness effects of adaptive CNVs. Local genomic sequences are likely to be an important determinant of these properties. Whereas it is known that point mutation rates vary with genomic location and local DNA sequence features, the role of genome architecture in the formation, selection, and the resulting evolutionary dynamics of CNVs is poorly understood. Previously, we have found that the GAP1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes frequent and repeated amplification and selection under long-term experimental evolution in glutamine-limiting conditions. The GAP1 gene has a unique genomic architecture consisting of two flanking long terminal repeats (LTRs) and a proximate origin of DNA replication (autonomously replicating sequence, ARS), which are likely to promote rapid GAP1 CNV formation. To test the role of these genomic elements on CNV-mediated adaptive evolution, we performed experimental evolution in glutamine-limited chemostats using engineered strains lacking either the adjacent LTRs, ARS, or all elements. Using a CNV reporter system and neural network simulation-based inference (nnSBI) we quantified the formation rate and fitness effect of CNVs for each strain. We find that although GAP1 CNVs repeatedly form and sweep to high frequency in strains with modified genome architecture, removal of local DNA elements significantly impacts the rate and fitness effect of CNVs and the rate of adaptation. We performed genome sequence analysis to define the molecular mechanisms of CNV formation for 177 CNV lineages. We find that across all four strain backgrounds, between 26% and 80% of all GAP1 CNVs are mediated by Origin Dependent Inverted Repeat Amplification (ODIRA) which results from template switching between the leading and lagging strand during DNA synthesis. In the absence of the local ARS, a distal ARS can mediate CNV formation via ODIRA. In the absence of local LTRs, homologous recombination mechanisms still mediate gene amplification following de novo insertion of retrotransposon elements at the locus. Our study demonstrates the remarkable plasticity of the genome and reveals that template switching during DNA replication is a frequent source of adaptive CNVs."]},

We analyzed 192 accessions from 83 natural populations, revealing a 128 Mb range in genome size. Plastome haplotype analysis identified a haplogroup that shifted niches to tropics and evolved larger genomes. A strong correlation was found between larger genomes and tropical habitats characterized by higher temperatures and lower seasonality. Genomic repeat content, particularly 45S rDNA and Ty1-copia transposable elements, was associated with larger genomes. Reciprocal transplantation experiments confirmed the adaptive nature of large genomes in tropical environments, with individuals exhibiting lower growth rates but higher fecundity. Our findings support the large genome selection hypothesis, suggesting that genome size enlargement, driven by genomic repetitive elements, can be an adaptive response to high temperatures of tropics. As global warming continues, plants with larger genomes may exhibit slower growth but increased reproductive output, potentially impacting ecosystem dynamics and agricultural productivity."]},

Recent syngnathid genome assemblies revealed suggestive gene content differences and provide the opportunity for detailed genetic analyses. We created a single cell RNA sequencing atlas of Gulf pipefish embryos to understand the developmental basis of four traits: derived head shape, toothlessness, dermal armor, and male pregnancy. We completed marker gene analyses, built genetic networks, and examined spatial expression of select genes. We identified osteochondrogenic mesenchymal cells in the elongating face that express regulatory genes bmp4, sfrp1a, and prdm16. We found no evidence for tooth primordia cells, and we observed re-deployment of osteoblast genetic networks in developing dermal armor. Finally, we found that epidermal cells expressed nutrient processing and environmental sensing genes, potentially relevant for the brooding environment. The examined pipefish evolutionary innovations are composed of recognizable cell types, suggesting derived features originate from changes within existing gene networks. Future work addressing syngnathid gene networks across multiple stages and species is essential for understanding how their novelties evolved."]},

In this study, we investigate how gene deletions compensating for a defect in the polarity pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae impact the fitness landscape. Using a transposon mutagenesis screen, we demonstrate that gene fitness has changed on a genome-wide scale in the compensated strain. An analysis of the functional associations between the affected genes reveals that compensation impacts cellular processes that have no clear connection to cell polarity. Moreover, genes belonging to the same process tend to show the same direction of gene fitness change, indicating that compensation rewires the fitness contribution of cellular processes rather than of individual genes. In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that functional overlap between modules and the interconnectedness of the molecular interaction network play major roles in mediating compensatory evolution."]},

However, for lesser-known infectious diseases, such as tick-borne viruses, disease risk reporting should account for more than just the biology of the disease and include mediating factors such as socioeconomics which can determine if an infection gets reported. Objectives: We aim to identify country-level ecological and socioeconomic factors important to reporting tick-borne viruses and examine whether countries with more economic resources have a higher likelihood of reporting resource intensive incidences. Our study goals are to determine potential country-level interventions that could enhance recognition of and reduce the health burden associated with tick-borne viruses. Methods: We apply machine learning to the most comprehensive tick-borne virus database, ZOVER, with a curated global trait matrix of 23 environmental and socioeconomic predictors. Results: We identified socioeconomic factors driving reported tick-borne viruses captured in the database at a country level. Countries that were more likely to report tick-borne viruses had a lower Gini Index (i.e., countries with less inequalities such as Nordic countries), increased dollars spent on pesticide imports, and had institutions (i.e., IVSA chapter) or individuals with agricultural, forestry, or veterinary knowledge (i.e., % of tertiary grads) present. Additional characteristics included countries with a lower percent of population exposed to conflict also had a higher probability of reporting a tick-borne virus. As expected, broad environmental factors such as the Koeppen-Geiger climate classification zone was important and identified Mediterranean climate or humid subtropical climate as environmentally suitable zones for reported tick-borne viruses. Discussion: For environmentally persistent pathogens, the role of ancillary factors mediating reporting must be considered for allocating resources to interventions. In addition, while direct interruption of transmission is important, socioeconomic interventions may be the greatest tool to reduce local disease burden."]},

As human influences on these bees become more pronounced, understanding their pollen foraging behavior is increasingly important. Pollen provides crucial nutrients for A. mellifera such as protein and lipids that are necessary for hive health and prosperity. Pollen DNA metabarcoding allows for the longitudinal analysis of the floral sources of corbicular (bee-collected) pollen. In this study we employ the use of metabarcoding and Oxford Nanopore Sequencing technology to analyze the floral composition of pollen samples collected on a weekly basis from two closely related hives. In total, we identified 74 distinct plant taxa (at the genus level) between the two hives. Although both hives had equivalent values of taxonomic richness and diversity, the majority of taxa identified were unique to the individual hives. This indicates a large degree of variation in pollen foraging despite the hives' relative proximity. In addition to this interhive analysis, we also analyzed changes in pollen origin of a single hive across the course of five months. We identified 59 distinct plant taxa within samples from this hive whose presence and relative abundance differ drastically on a weekly basis with no taxa being present in all samples across the observed time period. In addition, even though there was a median of 8 to 9 taxa detected in each sample, each sample was composed primarily of 1 to 2 taxa indicating a degree of foraging preference that changes on a regular basis. Further quantitative and qualitative comparisons completed in this study demonstrate the degree of variation in pollen foraging patterns both throughout the season and between hives."]},

Among the invasive species, mammals have a particularly profound impact on native ecosystems. As primary decomposers of mammalian feces, dung beetles are critical in ecosystem functioning, and their community structure is closely linked to their services. However, the introduction of invasive mammals threatens these beetles and potentially disrupts their ecosystem services. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the resulting changes in communities. We developed a novel population dynamics model focusing on the interactions among mammals, feces, and dung beetles. Our results indicate that such invasions increase the risk of extinction of specialist dung beetles that cannot utilize the feces of invasive mammals. The risk of extinction is particularly high when generalist dung beetles show a preference for native feces, leading to intensified interspecific competition for resources. Additionally,  the extinction risk of specialist dung beetles increases when invasive mammals display irruptive population dynamics. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that non-native mammalian invasions disrupt the coexistence of native dung beetle communities, potentially leading to losses in biodiversity and ecosystem function. These risks should be considered in future empirical studies to evaluate the impact of invasive mammals on dung beetle communities."]},

DNA barcodes were used to delimit operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that we considered as species surrogates to avoid the taxonomic deficit and calculate community-scale species richness and pair-wise Sorensen beta-diversity. We used log-ratio and generalised linear models to highlight the effects of biotic interactions and environment as drivers of alpha diversity, and generalised dissimilarity models to figure out the relative contribution of space and environment to beta-diversity at different spatial extents. Community-scale alpha diversity was mainly explained by habitat filtering (soil texture) and interspecific competition that limit the number of locally co-existing species. Beta diversity between pairs of communities was mainly explained by distance when comparing communities in similar habitats, by topography and available soil phosphorus when comparing communities in different habitats, and by distance, elevation and climate when comparing all possible pairs of communities. While community composition is determined locally by neutral processes and environmental filtering, biogeographic processes linked to dispersal limitation and adaptation to local environment are the most influential on a regional scale. This highlights the complex interplay of dispersal limitation, biotic interactions and environmental filtering during the process of community assembly."]},
