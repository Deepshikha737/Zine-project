Access to the EMR is both retrospective and prospective, allowing researchers to conduct prospective studies over time. Genetic profiling is done with population-optimized SNP arrays for the Han Chinese populations that enable genetic analyses such as genome-wide association, phenome-wide association, and polygenic risk score studies to evaluate common disease risk and pharmacogenetic response. Furthermore, the TPMI participants agree to be contacted for future research opportunities related to their genetic risks and receive personalized genetic risk profiles with health management recommendations. TPMI has established the TPMI Data Access Platform (TDAP), a central database and analysis platform that both safeguards the security of the data and facilitates academic research. The TPMI is the largest non-European cohort that merges genetic profiles with EMR in the world. With a cohort that can be followed over time, it can be utilized to validate genetic risk prediction models, conduct clinical trials to show the efficacy of risk-based health management, and optimize health policies based on genetic risks. In this report, we describe the TPMI study design, the population and genetic characteristics of the TPMI cohort, and the power it provides to conduct crucial studies in developing precision medicine on a population and personal level. As Han Chinese represent almost 20% of the world's population, the results of TPMI studies will benefit >1.4 billion people around the world and serve as a model for developing population-based precision medicine."
Biophysics,Opening and closing of a cryptic pocket in VP35 toggles it between two different RNA-binding modes,"Upasana L,Matthew Alberto,Neha,Maxwell I,Gregory R,Upasana L,Matthew Alberto,Neha,Maxwell I,Gregory R,Upasana L,Matthew Alberto,Neha,Maxwell I","Cryptic pockets are of growing interest as potential drug targets, particularly to control protein-nucleic acid interactions that often occur via flat surfaces. However, it remains unclear whether cryptic pockets contribute to protein function or if they are merely happenstantial features that can easily be evolved away to achieve drug resistance. Here, we explore whether a cryptic pocket in the Interferon Inhibitory Domain (IID) of viral protein 35 (VP35) of Zaire ebolavirus aids its ability to bind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). We use simulations and experiments to study the relationship between cryptic pocket opening and dsRNA binding of the IIDs of two other filoviruses, Reston and Marburg. These homologs have nearly identical structures but block different interferon pathways due to different affinities for blunt ends and backbone of the dsRNA. Simulations and thiol-labeling experiments demonstrate that the homologs have varying probabilities of pocket opening. Subsequent dsRNA-binding assays suggest that closed conformations preferentially bind dsRNA blunt ends while open conformations prefer binding the backbone. Point mutations that modulate pocket opening proteins further confirm this preference. These results demonstrate the open cryptic pocket has a function, suggesting cryptic pockets are under selective pressure and may be difficult to evolve away to achieve drug resistance."

Biophysics,Nonlinear Singular Value Decomposition Beamforming for Ultrasound Imaging of Gas Vesicles,"Ge,Mathis,Mohamed,Esteban,Nabil,Anatole,Thomas,Simon,Pascal,Claire,Mikhail,Mickael,Ge,Mathis,Mohamed,Esteban,Nabil,Anatole,Thomas,Simon,Pascal,Claire,Mikhail,Mickael,Ge,Mathis,Mohamed,Esteban,Nabil,Anatole,Thomas,Simon,Pascal,Claire,Mikhail","Ultrasound imaging holds significant promise for the observation of molecular and cellular phenomena through the utilization of acoustic contrast agents and acoustic reporter genes. Optimizing imaging methodologies for enhanced detection represents an imperative advancement in this field. Most advanced techniques relying on amplitude modulation scheme such as cross amplitude modulation (xAM) and ultrafast amplitude modulation (uAM) combined with Hadamard encoded multiplane wave transmissions have shown efficacy in capturing acoustic signals of gas vesicles (GVs). Nonetheless, uAM sequence requires odd- or even-element transmissions leading to imprecise amplitude modulation emitting scheme, and the complex multiplane wave transmission scheme inherently yields overlong pulse durations. xAM sequence is limited in terms of field of view and imaging depth. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an innovative ultrafast imaging sequence called nonlinear singular value decomposition (SVD) beamforming. Our method demonstrated a contrast imaging sensitivity comparable to the current gold-standard xAM and uAM, while requiring 4.8 times less pulse transmissions. With similar number of transmit pulses, nonlinear SVD beamforming outperforms xAM and uAM in terms of an improvement in signal-to-background ratio of + 4.78 dB and + 8.29 dB respectively. Additionally, our method provides a higher flexibility in terms of the selection of acoustic pressure amplitude compared to the other methods. Furthermore, it shows a significant potential for application in the realm of ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM), where it stands poised to facilitate the more precise extraction of nonlinear signatures originating from contrast agents."
Bioengineering,Thioether-functionalized cellulose for the fabrication of oxidation-responsive biomaterial coatings and films,"Eric Michael,Kate Elizabeth,Matthew Gardner,Laboni Farha,Payton R,Riya,Timothy M,Eric Michael,Kate Elizabeth,Matthew Gardner,Laboni Farha,Payton R,Riya,Timothy M,Eric Michael,Kate Elizabeth,Matthew Gardner,Laboni Farha,Payton R,Riya","Biomaterial coatings and films can prevent premature failure and enhance performance of chronically implanted medical devices. However, current hydrophilic polymer coatings and films have significant drawbacks, including swelling and delamination. To address these issues, we modified hydroxyethyl cellulose with thioether groups to generate an oxidation-responsive polymer, HECMTP. HECMTP readily dissolves in green solvents and can be fabricated as coatings or films with tunable thicknesses. HECMTP coatings effectively scavenge hydrogen peroxide, resulting in conversion of thioether groups to sulfoxide groups on the polymer chain. Oxidation-driven, hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic transitions that are isolated to the surface of HECMTP coatings under physiologically relevant conditions increase wettability, decrease stiffness, and reduce protein adsorption to generate a non-fouling interface with minimal coating delamination or swelling. HECMTP can be used in diverse optical applications and permits oxidation-responsive, controlled drug release. HECMTP films are non-resorbable in vivo and evoke minimal foreign body responses. These results highlight the versatility of HECMTP and support its incorporation into chronically implanted medical devices."
Cancer Biology,Nrf2 orchestrates epigenetic regulations and serves as the master regulator of KLF4 expression and activity during arsenic-induced transformation,"Ziwei,Zhuoyue,Jessica,Yiran,Wenxuan,Haoyan,John,Chitra,Fei,Ziwei,Zhuoyue,Jessica,Yiran,Wenxuan,Haoyan,John,Chitra,Fei,Ziwei,Zhuoyue,Jessica,Yiran,Wenxuan,Haoyan,John,Chitra","Emerging evidence suggests that Nrf2 plays a pro-carcinogenic role in cancer. Our previous study showed that arsenic-induced Nrf2 activation triggers metabolic reprogramming, leading to the formation of cancer stem-like cells. Here, we further demonstrated that KLF4, a key pluripotency factor, is a direct transcriptional target of Nrf2 in arsenic-exposed human bronchial epithelial cells. ChIP-seq analysis identified multiple Nrf2 binding peaks at the Klf4 gene locus, which overlap with the enhancer markers H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac. Nrf2 knockout reduced both KLF4 expression and enhancer marker enrichment, accompanied by a global decrease in KLF4 binding across the genome. In wild-type (WT) cells, arsenic treatment increased KLF4 binding on genes involved in oncogenic pathways such as STAT3, SOX2, Nrf2, cell growth, Hedgehog, and EMT. We also found that KLF4 engages in a self-feedback loop in response to Nrf2 signaling. Lastly, our data showed that the co-occupancy of Nrf2 and KLF4 is crucial for establishing active enhancer hubs in the genome. These findings suggest that the oncogenic effects of Nrf2 are, in part, mediated by Nrf2 dependent self-amplification of KLF4 expression and function. Thus, targeting both Nrf2 and KLF4 could be a promising therapeutic strategy for eliminating cancer stem-like cells."

Evolutionary Biology,Thermodynamic consistency of autocatalytic cycles,"Thomas,Denis,Etienne,Sylvain,Thomas,Denis,Etienne,Sylvain,Thomas,Denis,Etienne","Autocatalysis is seen as a potential key player in the origin of life, and perhaps more generally in the emergence of Darwinian dynamics. Building on recent formalizations of this phenomenon, we tackle the computational challenge of exhaustively detecting autocatalytic cycles in reactions networks, and further evaluate the impact of thermodynamic constraints on their realization under mass action kinetics. We first characterize the complexity of the detection problem by proving its NP-completeness. This justifies the use of constraint solvers to list all autocatalytic cycles in a given reaction network, and also to group them into compatible sets, composed of cycles whose stoichiometric requirements are not contradictory. Crucially, we show that the introduction of thermodynamic realism does constrain the composition of these sets. Compatibility relationships among cycles can indeed be disrupted when the reaction kinetics obey thermodynamic consistency throughout the network. On the contrary, these constraints have no impact on the realizability of isolated cycles, unless upper or lower bounds are imposed on the concentrations of the reactants. Overall, by better characterizing the conditions of autocatalysis in complex reaction systems, this work brings us a step closer to assessing the contribution of this collective chemical behavior to the emergence of natural selection in the primordial soup."

Evolutionary Biology,Effects of a transmissible cancer on life-history traits in Tasmanian devils,"Kasha,Menna E,Shelly,Sebastien,Rodrigo,Paul  A.,Hamish,Andrew,Loeske,Kasha,Menna E,Shelly,Sebastien,Rodrigo,Paul  A.,Hamish,Andrew,Loeske,Kasha,Menna E,Shelly,Sebastien,Rodrigo,Paul  A.,Hamish,Andrew","Shifts in life history traits, such as timing of reproduction, can help mediate population declines following perturbations, and early reproduction should be favoured when adult survival is impacted more than juvenile survival. In Tasmanian devils, following the emergence of a fatal transmissible cancer, females started to breed precocially (i.e., at age one instead of typically age two) and the same time as populations started to decline following disease emergence. Here, we focus on a diseased site (Freycinet Peninsula, Tasmania, Australia) with 18 years of continuous mark-recapture data to test: (1) whether rates of precocial breeding in females continued to increase after the initial rise after the emergence of the disease, (2) whether there was a relationship between body size and breeding success for either one-year-olds or adult females (i.e., at least two-years-old), and (3) whether there was inbreeding depression in breeding success for either age category. We show that rates of precocial breeding did not continue to rise, and that the proportion of precocially breeding females has plateaued at around 50%. We also show that there was no effect of body size on the probability of breeding for either one-year-old or for adult females. Finally, we show that there was no evidence for inbreeding depression in breeding success for either age class. We discuss possible constraints that may have inhibited further rise in rates of precocial breeding in the context of limitations to growth in the offspring of precocially breeding (and therefore smaller) females."

The DNA extraction with magnetic nanoparticles accommodates these demands by providing a method that is safe, simple, and yet able to give good purity. The purity parameter of the extracted DNA is based on the A260/280 value. This meta-analysis aims to find variables that can affect the purity of extracted DNA using magnetic nanoparticles, based on its extraction and particle synthesis procedure. The information to be analyzed is from DNA extraction from human blood, plasmid extraction, and E. coli gDNA extraction. The research begins with a systematic review to collect appropriate studies and analysis will be carried out using Minitab to find variables that affect the purity of DNA, either positive or negative. Here we show, that no variables have been found significant to the purity of the extracted DNA in both the DNA extraction procedure steps and reagents.

Evolutionary Biology,A novel downstream factor in willows replaces the ancestral sex determining gene,"Yuan,Zhiqing,Ren-Gang,Elvira,Xiao-Ru,Judith E.,Li,Yuan,Zhiqing,Ren-Gang,Elvira,Xiao-Ru,Judith E.,Li,Yuan,Zhiqing,Ren-Gang,Elvira,Xiao-Ru,Judith E.","Sex chromosome turnover has occurred in many groups, and is mediated by the translocation or duplication of apical sex-determining genes, or the replacement of original sex determination genes by new ones. In dioecious plants, the former frequently occurs, while the latter is rarely reported. Here, we assembled four haplotype-resolved chromosome-level genomes from four lineages of the Salix polyclona complex, including three diploids (E, E-TS, and W1) and one autotetraploid (W2). Our analyses reveal that diploids have a ZW/ZZ system, while autotetraploid has a ZZZW/ZZZZ system on chromosome 15. The apical sex-determining genes of Salicaceae, ARR17-like duplicates on chromosomes 15 and 19, which can indirectly turn-on/off the expression of PISTILLATA (PI) gene and determine sex, appears to have lost the function of sex determination in the S. polyclona complex. We found a novel sex determining factor on the 15W of the complex, namely partial PI-like duplicates, which has taken over the function from the ARR17-like duplicates. In conclusion, a new dominant sex-determining gene was recruited in the S. polyclona complex, replacing the ancestral apical sex-determining ARR17-like duplicates. The newly identified partial PI-like duplicates exhibit a direct influence on the downstream intact PI-like duplications, providing valuable insights into the evolutionary trajectory of the top-down sex determination pathway."
Biophysics,The 3D point spread function can be autoencoded in latent space,"Axel,Konrad,Johan,Axel,Konrad,Johan,Axel,Konrad",The 3D point spread function of a fluorescence emitter in a living cell is often different from that of the z-stack of bead images typically used as a reference. Here we show that the location in z of a fluorescent emitter can be directly accessed in the latent space of an autoencoder trained on the sample images without z-reference data. The corresponding decoding network represents an accurate point spread function.
Biophysics,Innovative Strategies for Enhancing Signal-to-Noise Ratio in Single-molecule Imaging: The Influence of Molecular Motion,"Gayun,Gyeongho,Seongyu,Jae-Hyung,Jong-Bong,Gayun,Gyeongho,Seongyu,Jae-Hyung,Jong-Bong,Gayun,Gyeongho,Seongyu,Jae-Hyung","Single-molecule fluorescence imaging has extensively revealed the dynamic and structural characteristics of biomolecules. However, its application is limited by the upper concentration of fluorophore-tagged biomolecules, which is in the sub-ten nanomolar range. We found that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in single-molecule fluorescence imaging is strongly influenced by the size of fluorophore-labeled molecules in solution. Our computational simulations suggest that the faster diffusion of background fluorophores can enhance the SNR of target molecules. Moreover, we identified that the molecular motion through fluid flow can improve SNR. This study provides a novel perspective by emphasizing the importance of molecular motion in SNR and propose a rapid barrier-free method to increase the upper concentration limit in single-molecule imaging."

We determined the full-length cryo-EM structure of p62 and elucidated a structured double helical filament scaffold associated with the PB1-domain and the flexible C-terminal part residing in the lumen and the solvent-accessible major groove. At different pH values and upon binding to soluble LC3, LC3-conjugated membranes and poly-ubiquitin, we observed p62 filament re-arrangements in the form of structural unwinding, disassembly, lateral association and bundling, respectively. In the cellular environment, under conditions of ATG5 knockdown leading to stalled autophagy, we imaged high-contrast layers consisting of p62 oligomers enwrapping lipid droplets by cryogenic electron tomography in cellulo, which we identified as calcium phosphate by compositional spectroscopy analysis. Together, we visualized the cellular ultrastructure of p62 oligomers with high calcium content as a potential intermediate step of autophagy initiation."
Biophysics,Physical traits of supercompetitors in cell competition,"Logan C,Shiladitya,Logan C,Shiladitya,Logan C","Cell competition is a fitness control mechanism in tissues, where less fit cells are eliminated to maintain tissue homeostasis. Two primary mechanisms of cell elimination have been identified in cell competition studies: contact-dependent cell death and mechanical compression-driven apoptosis. While both occur in tissues, their combined impact on population dynamics is unclear. Here we develop a cell-based computational model to study competition between two cell types with differing physical properties. The model integrates cellular mechanics with cell-cycle dynamics, contact-induced apoptosis, and cell extrusion via mechanical stress. Using this model, we explored how differences in physical traits between cell types influence competitive interactions. Our findings show that differences in cell compressibility alone can drive mechanical competition, with stiffer cells outcompeting softer ones in otherwise identical populations. Surprisingly, mutations that reduce cell stiffness, combined with decreased contact inhibition of proliferation, can create a ""soft"" super-competitive mutant. We demonstrate that changes in apoptosis sensitivity, cell adhesion, and cell size significantly affect growth potential and susceptibility to apoptosis. Furthermore, mutant cell colonies require a critical colony size, dependent on cell compressibility, to overtake the surrounding wild-type tissue. For colonies below the critical size, the elimination process is stochastic, driven by a protrusive finger-like instability in the interface between two cells that promote invasion of the supercompetitors."

Confocal microscopy has previously shown that PSD95 is enriched in the postsynaptic terminals of excitatory synapses and 2D super-resolution microscopy further revealed that it forms nanoclusters. In this study, we utilized 3D super-resolution microscopy to examine the nanoarchitecture of PSD95 in the mouse brain, characterizing over 8 million molecules. While we were able to identify structural subtypes previously reported, imaging in 3D allowed us to classify these with higher accuracy. Furthermore, 3D super-resolution microscopy enabled the quantification of protein levels, revealing an abundance of PSD95 molecules existed outside of synapses as a diffuse population of supercomplexes, containing multiple copies of PSD95. Further analysis of the supercomplexes containing two units identified two populations: one that had PSD95 molecules separated by 39 ± 2 nm, and a second with a separation of 94 ± 27 nm. These results suggest that PSD95 supercomplexes containing multiple protein copies assemble outside the synapse and then integrate into the synapse to form a supramolecular nanocluster architecture."

Biophysics,Insights into a clock's fidelity through vesicular encapsulation,"Alexander Zhan Tu,Andy,Anand Bala,Alexander Zhan Tu,Andy,Anand Bala,Alexander Zhan Tu,Andy","The single-celled cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus, generates circadian rhythms with exceptional fidelity and synchrony despite their femtoliter volumes. Here, we explore the mechanistic aspects of this fidelity, by reconstituting the KaiABC post-translational oscillator (PTO) in cell-mimetic giant vesicles (GUVs) under well-defined conditions in vitro. PTO proteins were encapsulated with a coefficient of variation that closely matched protein variations observed in live cells. Using fluorescently labeled KaiB and confocal microscopy, we were able to measure circadian rhythms generated by thousands of encapsulated PTOs at the single-vesicle level for several days as a function of protein concentration and GUV size. We find that PTO fidelity decreased with decreasing levels of encapsulated PTO proteins and in smaller GUVs. We also observed that in encapsulated PTOs, a significant fraction of KaiB localized to GUV membranes like it does in cyanobacteria. A mathematical model that uses empirical bulk concentration and stoichiometry limitations suggests that cyanobacteria overcome challenges to fidelity by expressing high levels of PTO proteins along with the CikA and SasA proteins, which buffer stochastic variations in the levels of KaiA and KaiB, respectively. Further, the model suggests that the transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL) contributes at most a small percentage to the overall fidelity of the cyanobacterial circadian clock under constant conditions but is essential for maintaining phase synchrony. Our results are the first experimental demonstration of populations of synthetic cells that can autonomously keep circadian time. Additionally, the approach of using bulk relationships to understand complex phenomena in cell-like systems could be useful for understanding other collective behavior important in biology, such as liquid-liquid phase separation."
Biophysics,Optimal network sizes for most robust Turing patterns,"Hazlam S,Aibek,Antonio,Robert G,Hazlam S,Aibek,Antonio,Robert G,Hazlam S,Aibek,Antonio","Many cellular patterns exhibit a reaction-diffusion component, suggesting that Turing instability may contribute to pattern formation. However, biological gene-regulatory pathways are more complex than simple Turing activator-inhibitor models and generally do not require fine-tuning of parameters as dictated by the Turing conditions. To address these issues, we employ random matrix theory to analyze the Jacobian matrices of larger networks with robust statistical properties. Our analysis reveals that Turing patterns are more likely to occur by chance than previously thought and that the most robust Turing networks have an optimal size, surprisingly consisting only of a handful of molecular species, thus significantly increasing their identifiability in biological systems. This optimal size emerges from a tradeoff between the highest stability in small networks and the greatest instability with diffusion in large networks.

Our findings may inform future synthetic biology approaches and provide insights into bridging the gap to complex developmental pathways."
Biophysics,Cell shape noise strength regulates shape dynamics during EMT-associated cell spreading,"Wolfram,Iskra,Guillaume,Ewa K,Wolfram,Iskra,Guillaume,Ewa K,Wolfram,Iskra,Guillaume","Cellular shape is intimately linked to cell function and state, and transitions between cell states are tightly coupled to shape changes. Yet, shape has been largely overlooked in state transitions studies. Here, we combine morphometric analysis with theoretical modeling and molecular perturbations to interrogate cell shape dynamics during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Using stochastic inference, we extract the morphogenetic landscape underlying EMT. We show that within this landscape, EMT-associated cell spreading reflects a transition between shape attractors. Strikingly, we observe a peak in cell shape noise strength concomitant with spreading, and show that higher shape noise accelerates transitions between shape attractors. Our analysis framework will be widely applicable to quantitative cell shape investigations in physiology and disease. Together, our results identify a key role for cellular stochasticity as a regulator of shape change rates, and highlight that shape dynamics yield rich phenotypic information that enhance our understanding of cellular states."

Evolutionary Biology,Heterosis in crosses between remnant populations of a rare prairie forb: implications for restoration genetics,"Christopher G,Isabelle A,Juan Diego,Bob,Christopher G,Isabelle A,Juan Diego,Bob,Christopher G,Isabelle A,Juan Diego","Background and Aims
A major goal in both basic and applied evolutionary genetics is understanding the role of drift in shaping genetic variation with fitness consequences. For organisms amenable to controlled crosses, the increased fitness of progeny from between- relative to within-population crosses (heterosis) provides a useful tool to infer historical fixation of partly recessive deleterious alleles by drift and/or bottlenecks. Additionally, heterosis may also provide a unique benefit in regional admixture provenancing for restorations of rare plant species, but empirical data to directly test this idea is lacking.
Methods
We quantified heterosis in crosses between small remnant populations of a rare prairie forb (Silene regia Sims). We measured early fitness components (seed number per fruit, germination, and juvenile survival) in a controlled environment. Adult fitness components (survival and reproduction) were quantified over two flowering seasons in two different environments, a field common garden simulating the initial stages of a restoration, and a greenhouse. To our knowledge, our study is the first to estimate cumulative fitness for a rare species in conditions of a newly established restoration in the field. Additionally, we provide a unique comparison of heterosis estimated under controlled vs. field conditions.
Key Results
The consequences of between-population crosses for cumulative fitness in the field were strongly positive in two of the populations (132-292% heterosis) and neutral in a third. Heterosis was generally stronger when measured under field conditions and was more likely to be detected for adult fitness components.
Conclusions
Regional admixture provenancing in restorations should be beneficial for this species. We advocate for more research on heterosis in rare species, particularly in restorations. Such restorations can be opportunities for experimental genetics in addition to reestablishing important ecosystem services."

Biophysics,Bilateral cellular flows display asymmetry prior to left-right organizer formation in amniote gastrulation,"Rieko,Shubham,Vivek N,Takashi,Rieko,Shubham,Vivek N,Takashi,Rieko,Shubham,Vivek N","A bilateral body plan is predominant throughout the animal kingdom. Bilaterality of amniote embryos becomes recognizable as midline morphogenesis begins at gastrulation, bisecting an embryonic field into the left and right sides, and left-right asymmetry patterning follows. While a series of laterality genes expressed after the left-right compartmentalization has been extensively studied, the laterality patterning prior to and during midline morphogenesis has remained unclear. Here, through a biophysical quantification in a high spatial and temporal resolution, applied to a chick model system, we show that a large-scale bilateral counter-rotating cellular flow, termed as polonaise movements, display left-right asymmetries in early gastrulation. This cell movement starts prior to the formation of the primitive streak, which is the earliest midline structure, and earlier than expression of laterality genes. The cellular flow speed and vorticity unravel the location and timing of the left-right asymmetries. The bilateral flows displayed a Right dominance after six hours since the start of cell movements. Mitotic arrest that diminishes primitive streak formation resulted in changes in the bilateral flow pattern, but the Right dominance persisted. Our data indicate that the left-right asymmetry in amniote gastrula becomes detectable prior to the point when the asymmetric regulation of the laterality signals at the node leads to the left-right patterning. More broadly, our results suggest that physical processes can play an unexpected but significant role in influencing left-right laterality during embryonic development."

In land plants, successful cytokinesis requires precise targeting of Golgi-derived vesicles to the future division plane by the phragmoplast, a cytoskeletal structure that undergoes continuous remodelling. Endomembrane trafficking and phragmoplast remodelling are tightly coupled, indicating the existence of active crosstalk. However, although many molecular regulators of membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal organisation are known, it remains poorly understood how these processes are co-ordinated. Here, we describe a regulatory module consisting of the membrane-associated GTPase RAB-A2a, cytoskeleton-associated Class II Kinesin-12s, and the Fused kinase orthologue TIO. We provide evidence that the interaction between these molecules at the midzone is essential for cytokinesis in Arabidopsis through simultaneously targeting to the midzone and coupling phragmoplast remodelling to vesicle delivery."
Plant Biology,Evolution and theft: loss of state transitions in Bryopsidales macroalgae and photosynthetic sea slugs,"Vesa,Axelle,Heta,Esa,Paulo,Sónia,Vesa,Axelle,Heta,Esa,Paulo,Sónia,Vesa,Axelle,Heta,Esa,Paulo","Green macroalgae within the order Bryopsidales lack the fundamental photoprotective mechanisms of green algae, the xanthophyll cycle and energy-dependent dissipation of excess light. Here, by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence at 77K after specific light treatments, we show that Bryopsidales algae also lack state transitions, another ubiquitous photoprotection mechanism present in other green algae. Certain Sacoglossa sea slugs can feed on Ulvophyceae algae, including some Bryopsidales, and steal chloroplasts -kleptoplasts- that remain functional inside the animal cells for months without the support of the algal nucleus. Our data reveal that the state transition capacity is not retained in the kleptoplasts of the sea slugs, and we provide evidence that the loss is caused by structural changes during their incorporation by the animals. This enforced chloroplast sphericity was observed in all studied kleptoplastic associations, and we propose that it is a fundamental property supporting long-term retention of kleptoplasts in photosynthetic sea slugs."

Muscle – with chemical thermodynamics well-defined on two different thermal scales – provides a clear solution to this problem. In 1938, A.V. Hill made the extraordinary observation that the mechanics and chemistry of muscle contraction is defined independent of the structural components of muscle, implying that the mechanics and chemistry of myosin motor proteins within muscle do not classically scale up to muscle.

Biophysics,"Analysis of the dynamics of a complex, multipathway reaction: Insulin dimer dissociation","Kwanghoon,Spencer C.,Sammy,Aaron R.,Kwanghoon,Spencer C.,Sammy,Aaron R.,Kwanghoon,Spencer C.,Sammy","The protein hormone insulin forms a homodimer that must dissociate to bind to its receptor. Understanding the kinetics and mechanism of dissociation is essential for rational design of therapeutic analogs. In addition to its physiological importance, this dissociation process serves as a paradigm for coupled (un)folding and (un)binding. Based on previous free energy simulations, insulin dissociation is thought to involve multiple pathways with comparable free energy barriers. Here, we analyze the mechanism of insulin dimer dissociation using a recently developed computational framework for estimating kinetic statistics from short-trajectory data. These statistics indicate that the likelihood of dissociation (the committor) closely tracks the decrease in the number of (native and nonnative) intermonomer contacts and the increase in the number of water contacts at the dimer interface; the transition state with equal likelihood of association and dissociation corresponds to an encounter complex with relatively few native contacts and many nonnative contacts. We identify four pathways out of the dimer state and quantify their contributions to the rate, as well as their exchange, by computing reactive fluxes. We show that both the pathways and their extents of exchange can be understood in terms of rotations around three axes of the dimer structure. Our results provide insights into the kinetics of insulin analogues and, more generally, how to characterize complex, multipathway processes."
Plant Biology,The polyketide pathway in sporopollenin biosynthesis is specific to land plants (Embryophyta),"Dae-Yeon,Damanpreet K.,Neil W.,Dae-Yeon,Damanpreet K.,Neil W.,Dae-Yeon,Damanpreet K.","Sporopollenin (SP) is a complex biopolymer in the outer cell wall of spores and pollen and provides protection from environmental stresses. Its extraordinary biological and chemical resistance has defied efforts to elucidate its chemical composition and structure. This led to the adoption of broad and imprecise definitions of SP, which encouraged claims for its widespread occurrence among diverse embryophyte and non-embryophyte taxa and also misguided research on the evolution of SP and its roles during terrestrialisation. We previously proposed a more precise biochemical definition that can be used as a diagnostic tool to distinguish genuine SP from other chemically resistant cell wall materials. The definition was centred on the possession of ASCL (Anther-Specific Chalcone synthase-Like), an embryophyte-specific enzyme of the polyketide pathway that provides precursors for SP biosynthesis. Herein, we demonstrate that all five enzymes (CYP703, CYP704, ACOS, ASCL and TKPR) of the polyketide pathway are present in embryophytes but absent in green algae and propose a new, more comprehensive definition of SP: “Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant complex heteropolymer present in the outer walls of spores and pollen grains and is composed partly of hydroxylated polyketides derived from the conserved polyketide pathway, which typically involves CYP703A, CYP704B, ACOS, ASCL and TKPR.” Furthermore, we examine the evolution of all five enzymes of the polyketide pathway from ancestral enzymes of primary metabolism. We discuss the co-selection of ACOS, ASCL and TKPR and also provide evidence that gene dosage of all five genes in the pathway has been subjected to strict evolutionary control. This study further signifies SP as an evolutionary innovation unique to the embryophyte lineage and encourages research on possible evolutionary relationships between genuine embryophyte SP and other ‘SP-like materials’ in reproductive bodies including algal zygospores and dinoflagellate cysts."

Plant Biology,Four cell wall-degrading enzymes of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris determine bacterial escape from hydathodes to the leaf vasculature,"Misha,Marcel,Sebastian,Harrold A,Misha,Marcel,Sebastian,Harrold A,Misha,Marcel,Sebastian","To colonize plants, pathogenic bacteria modulate the biology of the host employing different bacterial secretion systems. For example, the type II secretion system (T2SS) releases toxins, proteases, lipases and carbohydrate-degrading enzymes into the extracellular environment to promote tissue softening and soft rot. In this way, the T2SS promotes virulence of phytopathogenic Gram-negative bacteria.  However, the role of the T2SS and its substrates for vascular disease remains enigmatic. Here, we show that the Xps-T2SS allows Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) to breach the tissue barrier between hydathodes - the initial bacterial entry point - and xylem thereby gaining access to the leaf vasculature. Yet, Xps-T2SS was dispensable for bacterial multiplication in the leaf apoplast or inside the hydathode cavity suggesting a role beyond plant defense suppression or nutrient acquisition. Using comparative genomics, four plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) were found to be associated with vascular pathogenesis. Testing gene knockout combinations of those enzymes revealed that virulence of only the quadruple CWDE mutant was down to the level of the xps-T2SS mutant. Our results thus demonstrate that the Xps-T2SS and a set of CWDEs that is likely secreted by this system allow Xcc to break this tissue barrier enabling long-distance mobility of Xcc inside the host plant. We thus expand our understanding on how certain bacterial pathogens have specialized towards vascular pathogens."
Evolutionary Biology,Noncovarying storage effect: positive selection on mutant alleles that amplify random fitness and demographic fluctuations,"Yuseob,Yuseob","Temporally variable environments in natural populations generate fluctuations in both the fitness of mutant alleles and population size. The theory of storage effect predicted that balanced polymorphism emerges if a population is subdivided into two parts that are respectively exposed to and protected from the selective effect of fluctuating environment. Recently, adding cyclic fluctuation in population size to the model of storage effect was found to generate a novel force of positive selection on fitness-amplifying mutants that are eventually maintained in oscillatory polymorphism or fixed in the population. The latter particularly has an effect of amplifying population size oscillation. To further understand these eco-evolutionary dynamics and elucidate their generality in natural populations, this study built more realistic models that assume randomly, not cyclically, fluctuating selection and common demographic features, including heterogeneous ecological patches or an age structure with overlapping generations. Mathematical analysis revealed that this novel evolutionary force is generated when the size of the subpopulation subject to weak selection does not covary with the rest of the population. Simulations showed that this ‘noncovarying storage effect’ is robust to various perturbations in the model. Multi-locus simulations revealed that oscillatory polymorphism at many loci can be simultaneously maintained and that positive feedback between demography and selection can accelerate the sequential fixations of fluctuation-amplifying mutations and thus lead to a drastic amplification of population size fluctuation. These results suggest that the noncovarying storage effect is a potentially prevalent evolutionary force in nature for maintaining genetic variation and causing large demographic fluctuations."

Environmental association analysis (EAA) and various allele frequency comparisons in genomic environmental association (GEA) have become standard approaches for investigating the genetic basis of adaptation to natural environments. While these analyses provide insight into local adaptation, they have not been widely adopted in breeding or conservation programs. This may be attributable to the difficulty in identifying the best individuals for transplantation/relocation in conservation efforts or identification of the best parents in breeding programs. To explore the use of EAA and GEA for future breeding programs, we used a cereal crop - barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) as our case-study species due to its wide adaptability to different environments and agro-ecologies, ranging from marginal and low input fields to high-productive farms. Here, we use publicly available data to conduct environmental genomic selection (EGS) on 753 landrace barley accessions using a mini-core of 31 landrace accessions and a de-novo core of 100 as the training populations. Environmental genomic selection is to environmental association analysis (EAA) what genomic selection is to genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Since local adaptation to the environment is polygenic, a whole-genome approach is likely to be more accurate for selecting for environmental adaptation. Here we show distinct genetic background and population differences and how an integrative approach coupling environmental genomic selection and species distribution modelling can help identify key parents for breeding for adaptation to specific environmental variables and geographies to minimize linkage drag."

Mutations disrupting self-incompatibility paralleled by changes retracting the stigma position (SP) within the staminal cone conferred strict autogamy and self-fertility to the cultivated forms. Although major genes affecting these changes have been identified, SP control in domesticated forms retaining a non-inserted or a heat-inducible SP needs elucidation. To widen the possibility of identifying SP genetic determinants, we analysed the trait in four populations (two germplasm collections, a multiparental recombinant inbred and a biparental progeny) under different environmental conditions (normal and heat stressed). Overall, 36 markers significantly associated with the trait were discovered. Several co-localizations were found, both among regions firstly reported in this work and among them and previously reported positions. This supported the reliability of the analysis. Three of such regions, in the long arms of chromosome 1, 8 and 11, were validated in an independent segregating population and candidate genes in confidence intervals were identified among transcription factors and hormone, stress and cell-wall-related genes. In conclusion, the work supported the hypothesis that the SP phenotype is controlled by different key-genes in tomato, paving the way to identifying novel players and novel mechanisms involved in the regulation of herkogamy."
Evolutionary Biology,Efficient epistasis inference via higher-order covariance matrix factorization,"Kai S.,John P.,Kai S.,John P.,Kai S.","Epistasis can profoundly influence evolutionary dynamics. Temporal genetic data, consisting of sequences sampled repeatedly from a population over time, provides a unique resource to understand how epistasis shapes evolution. However, detecting epistatic interactions from sequence data is technically challenging. Existing methods for identifying epistasis are computationally demanding, limiting their applicability to real-world data. Here, we present a novel computational method for inferring epistasis that significantly reduces computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. We validated our approach in simulations and applied it to study HIV-1 evolution over multiple years in a data set of 16 individuals. There we observed a strong excess of negative epistatic interactions between beneficial mutations, especially mutations involved in immune escape. Our method is general and could be used to characterize epistasis in other large data sets."

The aim of the research was to determine the resistance of sunflower hybrids to the broomrape parasite. During the research, a vegetation experiment was used to determine the racial composition of the parasite and the resistance of different sunflower hybrids to it. Sunflower hybrids were evaluated for resistance to broomrape in soil culture using a modified method and the roll method of seed germination. From the northern Steppe of Ukraine, broomrape is actively moving to the central, northern and western regions of the country. The practical value of the work is to determine the resistance of sunflower hybrids to broomrape. Differentiation of sunflower hybrids grown by resistance to the parasite was carried out. It has been observed that the broomrape population exhibits a significant level of virulence capable of overcoming the immunity found in the most resilient foreign-bred hybrids resistant to E, F, and G races of this parasite. The appearance of highly aggressive new races of broomrape (E, F, G, and H) in the Forest-Steppe and Polissya regions underscores the crucial necessity to address the challenge of developing breeding material resistant to these novel races of the parasitic plant. This entails an in-depth exploration of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying sunflower resistance to the pathogen. The widespread buildup of parasite races E, F, G, and H in sunflower crops is linked to the disruption of crop rotations and the extensive cultivation of hybrids of this crop. These hybrids are primarily resistant to races 5 (E) and 6 (F) of the parasite. The results of the research can be used in the region's farms for successful protection against broomrape, as well as in breeding programs to create sunflower hybrids resistant to new races of the parasite and corn hybrids that cause better germination of seeds of this pathogen in the soil and their death by their root secretions.

Understanding the ecological and evolutionary consequences for biodiversity will be crucial for our ability to respond effectively. Historical exposure to environmental stress is expected to select for resistant species, shifting community composition towards more stress-tolerant taxa. Concurrent with this species sorting process, genotypes within resistant taxa that have the highest relative fitness under severe stress are expected to increase in frequency, leading to evolutionary adaptation. However, empirical demonstrations of these dual ecological and evolutionary processes in natural communities are lacking. Here, we provide the first evidence for simultaneous species sorting and evolutionary adaptation across multiple species within a natural freshwater bacterial community. Using a two-phase stressor experimental design (acidification pre-exposure followed by severe acidification) in aquatic mesocosms, we show that pre-exposed communities were more resistant than naïve communities to taxonomic loss when faced with severe acid stress. However, after sustained severe acidification, taxonomic richness of both pre-exposed and naïve communities eventually converged. All communities experiencing severe acidification became dominated by an acidophilic bacterium, "

We use a sex-limited selection experiment, designed to subject genomic haplotypes of Drosophila melanogaster to selection for male fitness without opposing selection acting on female fitness. Importantly, we use three novel base populations to compare results with those from the LHM population, the sole population investigated using this technique. In contrast with previous studies, we find that male fitness of haplotypes subject to male-limited selection (ML populations) are not consistently better than their matched (MC) controls when tested in the ""wildtype"" state. Males from ML lines did not outperform controls in competitive fitness assays, mate choice trials, fecundity induction or sperm offense tests. As predicted, genetic variation for male fitness was reduced, with low fitness haplotypes apparently removed by selection, but this was only surveyed in one replicate population pair and included a potential artefact in the protocol. Female fitness was markedly reduced by carriage of ML genomic haplotypes, as predicted by sexual antagonism. Hence, our results are only partially consistent with the IaSC hypothesis, raising questions about the relative contribution of sexual conflict to the standing genetic variation in these populations and the potential role of artefacts in the protocol that may have obscured our ability to detect IaSC."
Evolutionary Biology,The coevolution of learning schedules and teaching enhances cumulative knowledge and drives a teacher-innovator syndrome,"Ludovic,Laurent,Charles,Ludovic,Laurent,Charles,Ludovic,Laurent","Natural selection shapes how individuals learn and acquire knowledge from their environment. Under the right conditions, this can lead to the evolution of learning schedules-how individuals allocate resources to acquire knowledge throughout their lifespan-that promote the accumulation of knowledge across generations (""cumulative knowledge"" or ""cumulative culture""). In spite of having been observed across multiple taxa, the role of parental teaching in this evolutionary process remains understudied. Using mathematical modelling, we show that learning schedules and parental teaching coevolve, resulting in greater time spent learning individually and innovating, as well as greater inter-generational transfer of knowledge from parent to offspring. These outcomes together enhance cumulative knowledge. Our analyses further reveal that within populations, selection typically favours an association between teaching and individual learning, leading to a  syndrome whereby some individuals innovate and teach within the family (""knowledge producers"" with extensive knowledge), while others teach less and learn socially outside of the family (""knowledge scroungers"" with less knowledge). Overall, our findings indicate that the coevolution of learning schedules and teaching promotes knowledge accumulation within and between generations, and favors diversity  within and between populations in knowledge acquisition, possession and transmission."
Evolutionary Biology,A fitness distribution law for amino-acid replacements,"Mengyi,Arlin,David Martin,Mengyi,Arlin,David Martin,Mengyi,Arlin","The effect of replacing the amino acid at a given site in a protein is difficult to predict. Yet, evolutionary comparisons have revealed highly regular patterns of interchangeability between pairs of amino acids, and such patterns have proved enormously useful in a range of applications in bioinformatics, evolutionary inference, and protein design. Here we reconcile these apparently contradictory observations using fitness data from over 350,000 experimental amino acid replacements. Almost one-quarter of the 380 types of replacements have broad distributions of fitness effects (DFEs) that closely resemble the background DFE for random changes, indicating an overwhelming influence of protein context in determining mutational effects. However, we also observe that the 380 pair-specific DFEs closely follow a maximum entropy distribution, specifically a truncated exponential distribution. The shape of this distribution is determined entirely by its mean, which is equivalent to the chance that a replacement of the given type is fitter than a random replacement. In this type of distribution, modest deviations in the mean correspond to much larger changes in the probability of falling in the far right tail, so that modest differences in mean exchangeability may result in much larger differences in the chance of a highly fit mutation. Indeed, we show that under the assumption that purifying selection filters out the vast majority of mutations, the maximum entropy distributions of fitness effects inferred from deep mutational scanning experiments predict the characteristic patterns of amino acid change observed in molecular evolution. These maximum entropy distributions of mutational effects not only provide a tuneable model for molecular evolution, but also have implications for mutational effect prediction and protein engineering."

Novel (i.e., mismatched) mitonuclear genotype combinations are therefore predicted to result in negative fitness consequences, which may become more prevalent with ageing. Such negative fitness effects are expected to be prominent in males, since maternal inheritance of mitochondria is predicted to lead to accumulation of male-harming mutations (the mother's curse hypothesis). To test these predictions, we measured female and male fertility traits using a genetically diverse panel of 27 mitonuclear populations of Drosophila melanogaster with matched or experimentally mismatched mitonuclear genomes at different ages. We found no overall effect of mitonuclear mismatch. In females, we found no effect of mitonuclear epistasis. In males, we found limited evidence of mitonuclear epistasis affecting fitness in old age, however, not in the direction predicted. Experimentally mismatched males sired more offspring in one comparison. Sex-specific advantages of mismatched males might arise if novel nuclear alleles compensate for deleterious mitochondrial alleles that have accumulated. If such compensatory effects of novel mitonuclear combinations increasing fitness occur in nature, they could represent a possible counterforce to the mother's curse."
Plant Biology,ABI5 Binding Proteins are substrates of key components in the ABA core signaling pathway,"Ruth R.,Tim,B. Joy,Teodora,Jonas,Ruth R.,Tim,B. Joy,Teodora,Jonas,Ruth R.,Tim,B.

The larger network of ABA signaling factors includes additional kinases and E3 ligases that modify these components to affect their activity and stability. The ABI5-Binding Proteins (AFPs) are negative regulators of ABA response. This study shows that the AFPs interact with specific family members of all components of this pathway and are substrates for SnRK2s and PP2Cs. AFPs also interact with subsets of MAP kinases (MPKs) and 14-3-3 proteins previously found to regulate activity of the ABI5-related clade of transcription factors. Residues predicted to be phosphorylated are conserved between AFPs, but are located within regions predicted to be unstructured. ABA promotes phosphorylation of AFP2, but conditions that prevent phosphorylation of AFP2 result in decreased stability, a shift in localization toward dispersed foci, and reduced effectiveness for inhibiting ABA response at germination. Thus, AFP2 appears to be an important hub in the ABA core signaling pathway."
Plant Biology,MMM and CLCFM: A 3D point cloud reconstruction method based on photogrammetry for all-around images taken by rotating an individual plant,"Atsushi,Nobuo,Kunihiro,Sachiko,Takanari,Atsushi,Nobuo,Kunihiro,Sachiko,Takanari,Atsushi,Nobuo,Kunihiro,Sachiko","This research proposes a novel technique for acquiring a large amount of high-density, high-precision 3D point cloud data for plants. We propose two methods, multi-masked matching (MMM) and the closed-loop coarse-to-fine method (CLCFM). The proposed approach addresses challenges in reconstructing plant 3D point clouds from all-around images using SfM and multi-view stereo methods. Given the complex structure of plants, with thin objects like leaves and stems overlapping, reconstructing accurate 3D point clouds presents significant challenges. One of these is occlusion, where points in the 3D point cloud cannot be obtained due to overlapping parts, preventing accurate point capture. Another is the generation of erroneous points in non-existent locations due to image matching errors along object outlines. The MMM mitigates these problems through an iterative process that alternates between locally generating point clouds and refining these point clouds by removing erroneous points using mask images. The proposed pipeline enables the construction of plant 3D point clouds with minimal noise and fewer missing points. By facilitating the acquisition of high-density, high-precision 3D data on a large number of plant bodies, as required for research activities, the proposed method is expected to enable comparative analysis of visible phenotypes in the growth process of a wide range of plant species based on 3D information."
Plant Biology,Mechanical properties are tuned during development with the fibrous network nature of the Arabidopsis cell wall,"Si,Isabella,Purvil,Bex,Meredith N.,Adrienne H.K.,Si,Isabella,Purvil,Bex,Meredith N.,Adrienne H.K.,Si,Isabella,Purvil,Bex,Meredith N.","Plant organ growth involves significant deformation of cell walls, with the mechanical behavior of these walls, particularly the epidermal cell walls, playing a crucial role in plant morphogenesis. To gain insights into the mechanics of plant growth, it is vital to study and quantify the large-deformation mechanical properties of the epidermal cell walls in the context of development. To this end, we investigated the mechanical response of the Arabidopsis leaf epidermis to stretching. The epidermis exhibited a non-linear stiffening behavior that naturally fell into three regimes. Each regime also corresponded with distinct nonlinear behaviors in terms of transverse deformation (i.e., Poisson effect) and unrecoverable deformation (i.e., plasticity). We found that these properties arise not from the geometric structure of the epidermal cells but rather from the cell wall material, which behaves as a fibrous network material. Using a five-beam model, we demonstrated that these nonlinear behaviors result from the transition from reorientation and bendingdominated to stretch-dominated deformation modes of cellulose microfibrils. We further explored how these mechanical properties change during development and found stiffening behavior is more pronounced at later developmental stage. Finally, our investigation into the "
Plant Biology,Wax bloom dynamics on Sorghum bicolor under different environmental stresses reveal signaling modules associated with wax production,"Madison,Marshall,Lucas,Madison,Marshall,Lucas,Madison,Marshall","Epicuticular wax blooms are associated with improved drought resistance in many species, including Sorghum bicolor. While the role of wax in drought resistance is well known, we report new insights into how light and drought dynamically influence wax production. We investigated how wax quantity and composition are modulated over time and in response to different environmental stressors, as well as the molecular and genetic mechanisms involved in such. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and photographic results showed that sorghum leaf sheath wax load and composition were altered in mature plants grown under drought and simulated shade, though this phenomenon appears to vary by sorghum cultivar. We combined an in vitro wax induction protocol with GC-MS and RNA-seq measurements to identify a draft signaling pathway for wax bloom induction in sorghum. We also explored the potential of spectrophotometry to aid in monitoring wax bloom dynamics. Spectrophotometric analysis showed primary differences in reflectance between bloom-rich and bloomless tissue surfaces in the 230-500nm range of the spectrum, corresponding to the blue color channel of photographic data. Our smartphone-based system detected significant differences in wax production between control and shade treatment groups, demonstrating its potential for candidate screening. Overall, our data suggest that wax extrusion can be rapidly modulated in response to light, occurring within days compared to the months required for the changes observed under greenhouse drought/simulated shade conditions. These results highlight the dynamic nature of wax modulation in response to varying environmental stimuli, especially light and water availability."

However, producing stable transgenic plants for plants such as soybean is a laborious and time-consuming process, which can impede research progress. Composite plants consisting of wild-type shoots and transgenic roots are an alternative method for generating transgenic plant tissues that can facilitate functional analysis of genes-of-interest involved in root development or root-microbe interactions. In this report, we introduce a novel set of GATEWAY-compatible vectors that enable a wide range of molecular biology uses in roots of soybean composite plants. These vectors incorporate in-frame epitope fusions of green fluorescent protein, 3x-HA, or miniTurbo-ID, which can be easily fused to a gene-of-interest using the GATEWAY cloning system. Moreover, these vectors allow for the identification of transgenic roots using either mCherry fluorescence or the RUBY marker. We demonstrate the functionality of these vectors by expressing subcellular markers in soybean, providing evidence of their effectiveness in generating protein fusions in composite soybean plants. Furthermore, we show how these vectors can be used for gene function analysis by expressing the bacterial effector, AvrPphB in composite roots, enabling the identification of soybean targets via immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. Additionally, we demonstrate the successful expression of stable miniTurbo-ID fusion proteins in composite roots. Overall, this new set of vectors is a powerful tool that can be used to assess subcellular localization and perform gene function analyses in soybean roots without the need to generate stable transgenic plants."

Aphids are one of the biggest group of ectotherms that transmit viruses to plants; more than 200 species have been identified as pathogen vectors. These aphids are responsible for transmitting over 300 viruses. The life-history traits of aphids such as fecundity and survival respond strongly and non-linearly to temperature and therefore to global warming. In this study, we elaborate the thermal responses for the main life-history traits (i.e, development and mortality rate) for aphid species for which data were available or generated. Also, thermal responses for virus transmission rates were elaborated to describe plant host to vector and vector to plant host dynamics. With these data, we elaborated thermal suitability models which were used to map current and projected scenarios for the transmission of viruses by aphids. Data was only available/generated for 19 aphid species, many of which only have data either at the lower or upper thermal limits. For virus transmission rates, from host plant to vector and from vector to plant data was only available/generated for potato virus Y (PVY), potato virus A (PVA), and potato leaf roll virus (PLRV) transmitted by the aphid "

However, despite their central role in evolution little is known about the factors that contribute to the structure, size, formation rate, and fitness effects of adaptive CNVs. Local genomic sequences are likely to be an important determinant of these properties. Whereas it is known that point mutation rates vary with genomic location and local DNA sequence features, the role of genome architecture in the formation, selection, and the resulting evolutionary dynamics of CNVs is poorly understood. Previously, we have found that the GAP1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes frequent and repeated amplification and selection under long-term experimental evolution in glutamine-limiting conditions. The GAP1 gene has a unique genomic architecture consisting of two flanking long terminal repeats (LTRs) and a proximate origin of DNA replication (autonomously replicating sequence, ARS), which are likely to promote rapid GAP1 CNV formation. To test the role of these genomic elements on CNV-mediated adaptive evolution, we performed experimental evolution in glutamine-limited chemostats using engineered strains lacking either the adjacent LTRs, ARS, or all elements. Using a CNV reporter system and neural network simulation-based inference (nnSBI) we quantified the formation rate and fitness effect of CNVs for each strain. We find that although GAP1 CNVs repeatedly form and sweep to high frequency in strains with modified genome architecture, removal of local DNA elements significantly impacts the rate and fitness effect of CNVs and the rate of adaptation. We performed genome sequence analysis to define the molecular mechanisms of CNV formation for 177 CNV lineages. We find that across all four strain backgrounds, between 26% and 80% of all GAP1 CNVs are mediated by Origin Dependent Inverted Repeat Amplification (ODIRA) which results from template switching between the leading and lagging strand during DNA synthesis. In the absence of the local ARS, a distal ARS can mediate CNV formation via ODIRA. In the absence of local LTRs, homologous recombination mechanisms still mediate gene amplification following de novo insertion of retrotransposon elements at the locus. Our study demonstrates the remarkable plasticity of the genome and reveals that template switching during DNA replication is a frequent source of adaptive CNVs."

This study investigates the genomic adaptations associated with the evolution of the ambrosia lifestyle across multiple fungal lineages. We performed comparative genomic analyses on 70 fungal genomes from four families (Irpicaceae, Ceratocystidaceae, Nectriaceae, and Ophiostomataceae), including 24 ambrosia and 34 non-ambrosia lineages. Our phylogenomic analyses reveal multiple independent colonization of insect vectors by the fungi, spanning from the mid-Cretaceous (114.6 Ma) to the early Quaternary (1.9 Ma). Contrary to expectations for obligate symbionts, ambrosia fungi showed no significant genome-wide reductions in size, gene count, or secreted protein repertoire compared to their non-symbiotic relatives. Instead, we observed complex, lineage-specific patterns of genomic adaptation. Key findings include lineage-specific expansions in carbohydrate-active enzyme families (AA4 in Nectriaceae, CE4 in Ophiostomataceae, and GH3 in Ophiostomataceae and Ceratocystidaceae), suggesting potential enhancement or loss of lignin modification, hemicellulose deacetylation, and cellulose degradation in different ambrosia lineages. Repeat-Induced Point mutation analysis revealed family-specific patterns rather than lifestyle-associated differences. These results highlight the diverse genomic strategies employed by ambrosia fungi, demonstrating that symbiont evolution can proceed through refined, lineage-specific changes rather than genome-wide, or convergent alterations. Our study suggests that unlike other insect-farmed fungi, ambrosia fungi are not domesticated crops, but rather free-living fungi which co-opted wood boring beetles as vectors via subtle, lineage-specific adaptations."

The developmental genetic and cellular changes that led to the evolution of these traits are largely unknown. Recent syngnathid genome assemblies revealed suggestive gene content differences and provide the opportunity for detailed genetic analyses. We created a single cell RNA sequencing atlas of Gulf pipefish embryos to understand the developmental basis of four traits: derived head shape, toothlessness, dermal armor, and male pregnancy. We completed marker gene analyses, built genetic networks, and examined spatial expression of select genes. We identified osteochondrogenic mesenchymal cells in the elongating face that express regulatory genes bmp4, sfrp1a, and prdm16. We found no evidence for tooth primordia cells, and we observed re-deployment of osteoblast genetic networks in developing dermal armor. Finally, we found that epidermal cells expressed nutrient processing and environmental sensing genes, potentially relevant for the brooding environment. The examined pipefish evolutionary innovations are composed of recognizable cell types, suggesting derived features originate from changes within existing gene networks. Future work addressing syngnathid gene networks across multiple stages and species is essential for understanding how their novelties evolved."

However, the evolution of evolvability-determining traits is often difficult to study because putative evolvability alleles often have confounding direct fitness effects of unknown origin and size. Here, we study theoretically and experimentally the evolution of mutation rates in proofreading polymerases with orthogonal control of direct and indirect selection. Mutagenic DNA polymerases enjoy a long-time fitness advantage by enhancing the rate of acquiring beneficial mutations. However, this is offset by a short-time fitness penalty, which we trace to a counterintuitive trade-off between mutation rates and activity in proofreading polymerases. Since these fitness effects act on different timescales, no one number characterizes the fitness of a mutator allele. We find unusual dynamic features in the resulting evolutionary dynamics, such as kinetic exclusion, selection by dynamic environments, and Rock-Paper-Scissors dynamics in the absence of ecology. Our work has implications for the evolution of mutation rates and more broadly, evolution in the context of an anti-correlation between mutation rates and short term fitness."
Zoology,Epidermal microstructures on the paired fins of marine sculpins provide new insights into mechanisms supporting benthic station-holding,"Emily A.,Austin M.,Shubham,L. Ann,Tom,Emily A.,Austin M.,Shubham,L. Ann,Tom,Emily A.,Austin M.,Shubham,L. Ann","Harsh environments, such as those with breaking waves and turbulent flows, present extreme challenges to organismal survival. Many animals exploiting these habitats possess adaptations to maintain position under dynamic flow conditions, such as reversible or permanent attachment systems. However, some station-holding fishes (e.g., sculpins) instead rely on morphological and behavioral modifications of their pectoral fins to increase friction with the substrate and combat drag. Despite epidermal microstructures on the fins of other benthic fishes, little exploration of pectoral fin surfaces at the microscopic scale has been undertaken in sculpins. Using scanning electron microscopy, we discovered microscopic, fibrillar projections contained within single cells on the ventral surfaces of the paired fin rays of two intertidal and two subtidal species of marine sculpins. In contrast to subtidal species, the intertidal species possessed epidermal cells with discrete channels separating groups of fibrillar projections. These features bear a striking resemblance to epidermal microstructures described in other fishes but have distinct morphological differences. We posit that these previously overlooked features likely contribute to sculpin station-holding performance via enhanced mechanical interactions with the substrate, suggesting new taxa within which to examine mechanisms of underwater friction enhancement and adhesion."

While interspecific comparisons have suggested selective pressures against large genomes, intraspecific variation has been less explored. Here, we investigate genome size variation within the hexaploid yellowcress herb, Rorippa indica, by integrating flow cytometry, plastomic phylogeography, genomic repeat profiling, and reciprocal common garden experiments. We analyzed 192 accessions from 83 natural populations, revealing a 128 Mb range in genome size. Plastome haplotype analysis identified a haplogroup that shifted niches to tropics and evolved larger genomes. A strong correlation was found between larger genomes and tropical habitats characterized by higher temperatures and lower seasonality. Genomic repeat content, particularly 45S rDNA and Ty1-copia transposable elements, was associated with larger genomes. Reciprocal transplantation experiments confirmed the adaptive nature of large genomes in tropical environments, with individuals exhibiting lower growth rates but higher fecundity. Our findings support the large genome selection hypothesis, suggesting that genome size enlargement, driven by genomic repetitive elements, can be an adaptive response to high temperatures of tropics. As global warming continues, plants with larger genomes may exhibit slower growth but increased reproductive output, potentially impacting ecosystem dynamics and agricultural productivity."
Evolutionary Biology,Global genetic rewiring during compensatory evolution in the yeast polarity network,"Enzo,Liedewij,Enzo,Liedewij,Enzo","Functional defects resulting from deleterious mutations can often be restored during evolution by compensatory mutations elsewhere in the genome. Importantly, this process can generate the genetic diversity seen in networks regulating the same biological function in different species. How the options for compensatory evolution depend on the molecular interactions underlying these functions is currently unclear. In this study, we investigate how gene deletions compensating for a defect in the polarity pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae impact the fitness landscape. Using a transposon mutagenesis screen, we demonstrate that gene fitness has changed on a genome-wide scale in the compensated strain. An analysis of the functional associations between the affected genes reveals that compensation impacts cellular processes that have no clear connection to cell polarity. Moreover, genes belonging to the same process tend to show the same direction of gene fitness change, indicating that compensation rewires the fitness contribution of cellular processes rather than of individual genes. In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that functional overlap between modules and the interconnectedness of the molecular interaction network play major roles in mediating compensatory evolution."

Evolutionary Biology,Diverse ancestries reveal complex symbiotic interactions during eukaryogenesis,"Moisès,Saioa,Marina,Toni,Moisès,Saioa,Marina,Toni,Moisès,Saioa,Marina","The origin of eukaryotes remains a central enigma in biology. Ongoing debates agree on the pivotal role of a symbiosis between an alpha-proteobacterium and an Asgard archaeon. However, the involvement of other bacterial partners as significant donors of genetic material, or the role of interactions with viruses remain contentious. To address these questions, we employed advanced phylogenomic approaches and comprehensive datasets spanning the known diversity of cellular life and viruses. Our analysis provided an updated reconstruction of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) proteome, in which we traced the phylogenetic origin of each protein family. We found compelling evidence for multiple waves of horizontal gene transfer from diverse bacterial and viral donors, with some likely preceding the mitochondrial endosymbiosis. We inferred the proteomes of the potential major donors and their functional contributions to LECA. Our findings underscore the contribution of horizontal gene transfers in shaping the proteomes of pre-LECA ancestors and hint to a facilitating role of Nucleocytoviricota viruses. Altogether, our results suggest ancient eukaryotes originated within complex microbial ecosystems through a succession of symbiotic interactions that left a footprint of horizontally transferred genes."

The unique insights gained from a genome-level perspective have revealed a striking pattern of conserved macrosynteny within chromosomes across huge phylogenetic distances in animals, yet progress in many lineages has been hampered by the absence of genome-level data. Here, we show that the tectonics of genome evolution in clitellates, a clade composed of most freshwater and all terrestrial species of the phylum Annelida, is characterised by extensive genome-wide scrambling that resulted in a massive loss of macrosynteny between marine annelids and clitellates, to the point that ancient bilaterian linkage groups (ie, groups of genes inherited as a block in most bilaterian phyla) are fully disrupted. These massive rearrangements included the formation of putative neocentromeres with newly acquired transposable elements, and preceded a further period of genome-wide reshaping events including whole-genome duplications and massive macrosyntenic reshuffling between clitellate lineages, potentially triggered by the loss of genes involved in genome stability and homeostasis of cell division. Notably, while these rearrangements broke short-range interactions observed between Hox genes in marine annelids, they were reformed as long-range interactions in clitellates. These genomic rearrangements led to the relocation of genes and the formation of new chimeric genetic elements, both of which may have contributed to the adaptation of clitellates to freshwater and terrestrial environments. Our findings provide evidence of a massive genomic reshaping within clitellates at 2D and 3D levels, and suggest that synteny may not limit the structural evolution of this animal lineage. Our study thus suggests that the genomic landscape of Clitellata resulted from a rare burst of genomic changes that ended a long period of stability that persists across large phylogenetic distances."

Although this approach has been successful, its limitations include lack of replication across species, compromising the generality of the inferences beyond microevolutionary time scales. Here, we carried out a comparative study of selection on wing shape and body size across multiple populations of two closely related and ecologically similar pond damselflies: Enallagma cyathigerum and Ischnura elegans (Odonata: Coenagrionidae). We found weak stabilizing selection on wing shape in both sexes, and no evidence that selection on this trait differed between the species. In contrast, selection on body size was curvilinear in males and directional in females, and they differed in form (males) and intensity (females) between these two species. By analyzing selection on the fine-grained spatial scale, we found that selection on male body size was shaped by the local mating system, and the relationship between mating system characteristics and directional selection was remarkably consistent across these species. Finally, we present a graphical model that links contemporary selection and macroevolution. Based on this model, we conclude that the persistence in ecological modes of life in pond damselflies offers a plausible explanation for why varying selection in nature may still result in a stable adaptive zone lasting millions of years."

Zoology,Effects of feeding water hyacinth (,"Yared,Yisehak,Nebiyu,Yared,Yisehak,Nebiyu,Yared,Yisehak","The utilization of unconventional feed resources, such as water hyacinth is an effective strategy to address feed shortages in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly where access to conventional feeds is limited. In this study, tropical sheep (Doyogena rams) and goats (Woyito-Guji bucks) fed diets containing different amounts of WH were examined for their zoo-technical performance and profitability sing a 2 × 4 × 4 randomized crossover design with two animal species, four nutritional treatments, and four feeding intervals. The dietary treatments consisted of 50% hay + 0% WH + 50% commercial concentrate (CC, T1), 50% hay + 12.5% WH + 37.5% CC (T2), 50% hay + 25% WH + 25% CC (T3), and 50% hay + 37.5% WH + 12.5% CC (T4). The findings showed that compared to goats, sheep had the highest energy and nutrient intake (P<0.001), nutrient digestibility (P<0.001), average daily gain (ADG, g/day), and body weight change (BWC (kg) (P<0.05). Regarding energy and nutritional intake, there was a substantial difference (P < 0.001) between treatment groups for both animal species, with the exception of goats’ consumption of DM, OM, CHO, GE, and ADL (P <0.05). Likewise, significant differences existed between treatment groups for nutritional digestibility, ADG, BWC, and FCE for both species (P <0.001). Moreover, significant interactions (P < 0.005) were seen in all energy and nutrient intake parameters between species and treatment. Furthermore, in tropical sheep and goat breeds, water hyacinth can replace up to 37.5% of the commercial concentrate used for growth and fattening, but it has a major comparative effect on sheep. Feed prices for the T4 group fed sheep and goats were 37.2% and 36.8% lower, respectively, than for the T1 group. Therefore, farmers in the tropics who cannot afford commercial concentrates can still benefit economically by using the dry biomass of water hyacinth in their diet, either with or without it."

Zoology,Images in red: A methodological and integrative approach for the usage of Near-infrared Hyperspectral Imaging (NIR-HSI) on collection specimens of Orthoptera (Insecta),"Gustavo  Costa,Neirivaldo  Cavalcante,Ana Lúcia  Nunes,José Antônio  Marin,Gustavo  Costa,Neirivaldo  Cavalcante,Ana Lúcia  Nunes,José Antônio  Marin,Gustavo  Costa,Neirivaldo  Cavalcante,Ana Lúcia  Nunes","Anthropogenic actions have caused severe environmental changes, leading to a rapid and massive loss of biodiversity, called the Holocene Extinction or ""Sixth Extinction."" In this context, integrative methods, capable of quickly and reliably determining and differentiating species, have become constantly demanded in taxonomic studies. Near-infrared spectroscopical technologies have proved to be promising for application in the integrative taxonomy of insects, and it is a true-non-destructive method, causing no damage to the sample and being completely chemical-preparation-free. Near-infrared spectral profiles are known as the fingerprints of the chemical composition of a given sample, and a new layer of information may be accessed. Hyperspectral imaging technologies in the near-infrared range are among the most popular, although their usage is still incipient in insect studies. As in other animal taxa, katydids' taxonomy has traditionally been based on morphological comparison, resulting in many misclassifications over the years. However, integrative methods are more and more required in taxonomic studies. Different methods and technologies have been used from an integrative perspective to minimize misidentifications, especially for non-taxonomist or untrained researchers. Here, we approach the applicability of near-infrared spectroscopy coupled with hyperspectral imaging technology to Ensifera specimens housed in collections, discussing the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges to future applications. As a result, we propose using only homologous body parts in comparing and modeling species using this kind of data due to the heterogeneity of the insects' exoskeleton. Additionally, we made a case study by discriminating four species of the katydid genus Conocephalus Thunberg, one of the most speciose genera within Orthoptera that is known to have polymorphic species, with variations expressed in the wing development and postabdomen appendages. We generated a Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) classification model for the species with an overall classification accuracy for the assigned pixels of 90% and specific accuracy for pixel discrimination ranging from 96% to 98%. This is one of the few research studies employing hyperspectral imaging in insects' taxonomy, and it is the very first to use this technology in Orthoptera; therefore, this is a preliminary approach to usage as an integrative method."

To investigate the cell cycle during cellular reprogramming, we developed a comprehensive set of cell cycle phase markers in the Arabidopsis root. Using single-cell RNA-seq profiles and live imaging during regeneration, we found that a subset of cells near an ablation injury dramatically increases division rate by truncating G1. Cells in G1 undergo a transient nuclear peak of glutathione (GSH) prior to coordinated entry into S phase followed by rapid divisions and cellular reprogramming. A symplastic block of the ground tissue impairs regeneration, which is rescued by exogenous GSH. We propose a model in which GSH from the outer tissues is released upon injury licensing an exit from G1 near the wound to induce rapid cell division and reprogramming."

The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains three loci for genes encoding H-protein. We show that in land plants, there are two clades of mitochondrial H-proteins; one that clusters with H1 and H3, and another that clusters with H2, an isoform mostly expressed in heterotrophic tissue and for which a null mutation results in a >99% impeded growth. After showing that all three isoforms fulfill the same metabolic function, we evidenced that the impaired root growth in h2 results from an altered cell cycle progression concomitant to a lower Target Of Rapamycin kinase activity. Subsequent metabolomic approaches revealed an accumulation of storage sugars and a significant decrease of the TCA intermediates and several vitamins in the h2 root cells as compared to the wild-type ones. 
Additional investigations evidenced that H2 acts as the main relay for lipoylation in root mitochondria, which diverges from the current lipoylation model proposed for photosynthetic tissues. Together, this work provides new insight on the control of the cell cycle by mitochondrial metabolism, and also challenges the current dogma for lipoylation in mitochondria of plant cells."
Zoology,Sperm quality metrics exhibit annual fluctuations in a critically endangered amphibian managed under human care,"Allison R.,Isabella J.,Carrie K.,Diane,Allison R.,Isabella J.,Carrie K.,Diane,Allison R.,Isabella J.,Carrie K.","The Puerto Rican crested toad (PRCT) is Puerto Rico’s only endemic toad and has undergone rapid population decline within the last 40 years. As a hedge against extinction, captive assurance colonies have been established at several zoological institutions for breeding and reintroduction. However, reproductive output has remained low, despite the use of hormone therapies to attempt to bypass missing abiotic cues and stimulate reproductive behaviors. This low output necessitates a better understanding of natural fluctuations in gamete, specifically sperm, quality in captive individuals. To generate an understanding of natural gametic cycles in captive PRCTs, we administered male PRCTs (n = 86) housed under natural temperature and photoperiod cycles with exogenous hormones monthly for one year. Samples were analyzed for motility and concentration to assess variations in sperm quality by month. Spermiation was successfully stimulated every month, but quality fluctuated; sperm motility was highest in June and July, while sperm concentration was highest in December, January, and March. These results indicate that, while hormones can be utilized to stimulate gamete production in PRCTs year-round, sperm quality is not consistent. Furthermore, the seasonal occurrence of peak sperm production of captive males differed from natural peaks reported for wild PRCTs. Our results illustrate the need for more biologically informed strategies for breeding of at-risk anuran populations."

Cardiac glycosides, along with additional specialized metabolites, also contribute to the ethnobotanical uses of A. curassavica. To facilitate further research on milkweed metabolism, we assembled the 197 Mbp genome of a fifth-generation inbred line of A. curassavica into 619 contigs, with an N50 of 10 Mbp. Scaffolding resulted in 98% of the assembly being anchored to 11 chromosomes, which are mostly colinear with the previously assembled common milkweed (A. syriaca) genome. Assembly completeness evaluations showed that 98% of the BUSCO gene set is present in the A. curassavica genome assembly. The transcriptomes of six tissue types (young leaves, mature leaves, stems, flowers, buds, and roots), with and without defense elicitation by methyl jasmonate treatment, showed both tissue-specific gene expression and induced expression of genes that may be involved in cardiac glycoside biosynthesis. Expression of a CYP87A gene, the predicted first gene in the cardiac glycoside biosynthesis pathway, was observed only in the stems and roots and was induced by methyl jasmonate. Together, this genome sequence and transcriptome analysis provide important resources for further investigation of the ecological and medicinal uses of A. curassavica."

However, there is relatively little known about their biosynthesis. To address this, we investigated the biosynthesis of salviarin, the simplest furanoclerodane structure in the ornamental sage Salvia splendens. Using a self-organizing map and mutual rank analysis of RNA-seq co-expression data, we identified three cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for converting kolavenol into salviarin precursors, consecutively: annonene, hardwickiic acid and hautriwaic acid. As annonene and hardwickiic acid have also been proposed as intermediates in the biosynthesis of salvinorin A, and to examine our hypothesis for common evolutionary origin of the furanoclerodane pathway between the two Salvia species, we searched for homologous genes in available data for S. divinorum. The enzymes encoded by orthologous genes from S. divinorum displayed kolavenol synthase (SdKLS), annonene synthase (SdANS), and hardwickiic acid synthase (SdHDAS) activity respectively, supporting the view that these are intermediate steps in the biosynthesis of salvinorin A. We investigated the origin of annonene synthase and the role of gene duplication in the evolution of this specific activity. Our work shows how S. splendens can serve as a model species for studying furanoclerodanes biosynthesis in Salvia species, contributes to understanding the evolution of specialized metabolism in plants, and provides new tools to produce salvinorin A in biotechnological chassis."

They derive from secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga by an unknown heterotrophic eukaryote, leading to a complex intracellular organization. In response to unfavorable conditions (stress), diatoms store oil in lipid droplets (LD), raising interest for applications, in particular biofuels. In spite of numerous investigations aiming to increase their oil content, LD biogenesis mechanisms in these organisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we functionally characterized the homolog of Seipin, a major actor of LD biogenesis, in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. PtSeipin shares conserved structural features with other Seipins, yet presents unique characteristics, that appear common to diatoms and more broadly Stramenopiles. We provide evidence that Stramenopiles Seipins were inherited from the host during secondary endosymbiosis. The localization of PtSeipin highlights that LD biogenesis can arise simultaneously from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plastid's most external membrane. Finally, the knock-out of PtSeipin leads to a strong increase of TAG accumulation, a feature that is not observed in other organisms and is greatly enhanced following high light exposure. Our results suggest a redirection of lipid fluxes towards TAG synthesis, reduced TAG recycling or a combination of both."

The mechanisms underlying such robustness remain, however, to be elucidated. Taking the sepal of Arabidopsis as a model, we investigated whether variability of gene expression plays a role in variation of organ morphology. Previous work from our team identified cell-wall related genes as being enriched among the genes whose expression is highly variable. We then hypothesized that the variation of measured morphological parameters in cell-wall related single knockout mutants could be correlated with the variation in gene expression of the corresponding gene (the knocked-out gene) in wild-type plants. We analyzed sepal morphology from 16 cell-wall mutants and found that, unexpectedly, the higher a gene is expressed in wild type, the more variable the size of the corresponding mutant. These findings support a contribution of cell-wall related genes to the robustness of sepal size."

This study investigates the potential of Moringa oleifera seeds as a low-cost protein source to address protein energy malnutrition. Moringa oleifera seeds were defatted using solvent and used in formulating diets for PEM-induced Wistar rats. The study analyzed the seeds' phytochemical constituents, proximate composition, amino acid profiles, and bioactive compounds through Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS). 20 Rats were randomly assigned to four groups: A=control, B= PEM, C= malnourished rats treated with 15% soya bean based-diet and D= malnourished rats  treated with 15% defatted Moringa oleifera seed-based diet. The results show that defatting increased protein content and reduced anti-nutritional factors like oxalates, saponins, and tannins, enhancing nutrient bioavailability. Defatted Moringa oleifera seed-based diets improved liver and kidney functions, lipid profiles, and protein digestibility in protein energy malnutrition-induced rats. Additionally, the seeds contained essential bioactive compounds with potential antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. These findings suggest that Moringa oleifera seeds could be a promising alternative protein source for combating protein energy malnutrition"

Scientific Communication and Education,Empowering future scientists: Mentors employ various strategies to engage students in professional science disciplinary literacy practices,"Trisha,Tanya,Gwendolyn,Gary S,Sarah C,Trisha,Tanya,Gwendolyn,Gary S,Sarah C,Trisha,Tanya,Gwendolyn,Gary S","Peer-review and publication are important parts of the scientific enterprise, and research has shown that engaging students in such scholarly practices helps build their sense of belonging and scientific identity. Yet, these disciplinary literacy skills and professional practices are often part of the hidden curriculum of science research, thus excluding students and others from fully understanding ways in which scientific knowledge is constructed, refined, and disseminated even though students are participating in such activities. Secondary students are increasingly involved in scientific research projects that include authentic disciplinary literacy components such as research proposals, posters, videos, and scientific research papers. More and more, students are also engaging in professional practice of publishing their scientific research papers through dedicated secondary science journals. How teachers and other mentors support the development of professional disciplinary literacies in students is critical to understand as part of supporting more student participation in research. To this end, we used a mixed- methods study of interviews and surveys to examine the experience and conceptions of the mentors (teachers and professional scientists) who guided pre-college students through the writing and publication of their scientific research projects. Analyzing our data from a lens of cognitive apprenticeship, we find that mentors encourage independence by primarily employing the method of “exploration”. We also find that mentors have divergent views on the value of publication within science, versus for student scientists specifically. Our findings suggest that mentors could work to explicitly reveal their own thinking within science writing to provide more sequenced support for student scientists."

Despite the central importance of signaling in biomedical research, our ability to quantify it in individual cells over time remains limited. Here, we introduce INSCRIBE, an approach for reconstructing signaling history in single cells using endpoint fluorescence images. By regulating a CRISPR base editor, INSCRIBE generates mutations in genomic target sequences, at a rate proportional to signaling activity. The number of edits is then recovered through a novel ratiometric readout strategy, from images of two fluorescence channels. We engineered human cell lines for recording WNT and BMP pathway activity, and demonstrated that INSCRIBE faithfully recovers both the intensity and duration of signaling. Further, we used INSCRIBE to study the variability of cellular response to WNT and BMP stimulation, and test whether the magnitude of response is a stable, heritable trait. We found a persistent memory in the BMP pathway. Progeny of cells with higher BMP response levels are likely to respond more strongly to a second BMP stimulation, up to 3 weeks later.

Recreating these intricate behaviors using well-defined molecules remains a major challenge at the intersection of biology, physics, and molecular engineering. Although the polymerization force of the actin cytoskeleton is characterized as a primary driver of cell motility, recapitulating this process in protocellular systems has proven elusive. The difficulty lies in the daunting task of distilling key components from motile cells and integrating them into model membranes in a physiologically relevant manner. To address this, we developed a method to optically control actin polymerization with high spatiotemporal precision within cell-mimetic lipid vesicles known as giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Within these active protocells, the reorganization of actin networks triggered outward membrane extensions as well as the unidirectional movement of GUVs at speeds of up to 0.43 μm/min, comparable to typical adherent mammalian cells. Notably, our findings reveal a synergistic interplay between branched and linear actin forms in promoting membrane protrusions, highlighting the cooperative nature of these cytoskeletal elements. This approach offers a powerful platform for unraveling the intricacies of cell migration, designing synthetic cells with active morphodynamics, and advancing bioengineering applications, such as self-propelled delivery systems and autonomous tissue-like materials."

Despite this, the literature reveals a gap in generalising these effects to specific classroom activities, partly arising from the absence of suitable instruments to measure emotions in situational educational scenarios. Our study introduces an experience sampling method to measure sixteen discrete emotional states, deriving two scales for positive and negative activating emotions. Grounded in psychological and neuroscientific theories that integrate emotion with cognition, our research explores the interplay between prior knowledge, preservice teachers’ anticipatory situational emotions, and subsequent learning in an experimental science education context. Analysing data from 269 preservice teachers from diverse backgrounds (STEM and non-STEM) at the upper-secondary level, we found that negative activating emotions are often rooted in non-STEM backgrounds and exacerbated by limited prior science knowledge. These negative emotions impact achievement and learning primarily through the mediating role of boredom. Furthermore, our results indicate that the detrimental impact of boredom on achievement is significantly influenced by prior knowledge, with a more pronounced effect on students with lower levels. Given that emotions are amenable to intervention, our findings propose that specifically addressing boredom in students with low prior knowledge could amplify the benefits of educational strategies."
Scientific Communication and Education,A ChatGPT Assisted Reading Protocol for Undergraduate Research Students Engaging with Biophysics Literature,"Marcus,Gonzalo R.,Anne V.,Frank X.,Marcus,Gonzalo R.,Anne V.,Frank X.,Marcus,Gonzalo R.,Anne V.","A major challenge for undergraduate students engaged in research is reading scientific literature. This is especially true for students engaged in biophysics research, where many of the concepts, definitions, and experimental methodologies discussed may be beyond the material covered in standard undergraduate courses. Without specific guidance on how to read journal articles, students can become overwhelmed, which may lead to students reading fewer papers and not engaging with the scientific literature related to their research. To help undergraduate students effectively engage with scientific papers, we have developed a guided reading protocol that combines pre-reading strategies, structured notetaking, and the use of ChatGPT. Using ChatGPT in this protocol allows students to clarify unfamiliar terms and concepts in an interactive way that helps them to integrate the paper’s content into their own understanding. To test the impact of this protocol, participants in this study were given an initial survey to determine their comfort and experience with reading scientific literature. After this they were given an abridged biophysics paper and the ChatGPT assisted guided reading protocol. The ChatGPT transcripts were analyzed using open coding and the students were given a post-study survey to determine how they felt about their experience using ChatGPT. We found that most students do not appear to engage with the literature regularly, which may be due to barriers they encounter in terms of new and unknown content. Analyzing their conversations with the chatbot, we observed that students asked for definitions, explanations of unknown concepts, summaries of text or their own understanding, and simplifications of the text. Overall, students reported in the post-implementation survey that using ChatGPT was a positive experience and all students reported that they expected to use ChatGPT in the future when reading scientific literature. From this work, we believe that this new chatbot assisted reading protocol may be a way to keep novice biophysics students from becoming discouraged when they begin reading scientific literature and help keep them engaged with the current literature in the field."

The goal of this analysis is to determine which approaches (including groups of focus, research methods, and settings/perspectives) from social science fields (i.e., psychology, sociology, and anthropology) are utilized in published peer-reviewed biology education research relating to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Scoping how social science approaches are used in this area is important to understanding whether biology education research could benefit from complementary approaches that might advance praxis. This analysis found that research informing the biology education community draws heavily from psychological perspectives that are overwhelmingly not disaggregated (78% of articles identifying a group used a lumped together one), are by far more quantitative (58% used survey, 26% grades, 20% school data) than qualitative (17% used interview, 10% observation), and did not (72%) adopt structural approaches. The addition of missing contributions from social science is critical to advancing interventions to broaden STEM participation given that merging paradigms can offer more robust, multi-level explanations for observed phenomena. This has important implications for education, biology education, biology education research, social science, and research in related STEM fields."
Scientific Communication and Education,Probing visual literacy skills reveals student conceptions of scale and abstraction with respect to chromosomes,"Crystal,Dina L.,L. Kate,Crystal,Dina L.,L. Kate,Crystal,Dina L.","Molecular biology can be difficult for undergraduate students because course content is often taught using highly-abstract visual representations. Genetic concepts can be depicted with lines, letters, shapes, and symbols, and students need to engage their visual literacy skills to appropriately decipher these abstract representations. We previously found that undergraduate course materials almost always represent chromosomes in abstract forms, such as “X” shapes or straight lines with a dot for the centromere. We hypothesized that students struggle to apply their visual literacy skills to accurately interpret these abstract representations of chromosomes, which may be related to the frequently-documented incomplete or incorrect ideas students have about chromosome structure and function. To explore students’ visual literacy related to representations of chromosomes, we conducted 35 semi-structured interviews with students who had taken at least a year of biology courses. We asked them to sketch chromosomes, interpret an abstract representation of chromosomes, and use the abstract representation to answer a question about meiosis. We found that 97% of participants (34 of 35) held conceptual errors related to chromosome structure and function. These conceptual errors were often not evident in participants’ verbal definitions of chromosomes and were only revealed in their sketches or explanations of their sketches. We found that participants frequently misinterpreted X-shaped representations of chromosomes, mistook unreplicated homologous chromosomes as separated sister chromatids, and held misconceptions related to the structure and function of centromeres. These findings have implications for how chromosomes are taught in biology courses. We recommend that instructors explicitly discuss the conventions and norms of representing chromosomes as a pathway for increasing students’ visual literacy in molecular biology."

Synthetic cell models have been developed as bionic materials to mimic inherent cellular features such as self-assembly. Here, we leverage co-assembly of synthetic and natural cells to create hybrid living 3D cancer cultures. We screened synthetic cell models, including giant unilamellar vesicles, coacervates, microdroplet emulsions, proteinosomes, and colloidosomes, for their ability to form hybrid tumoroids. Our results identify the balance of inter- and extracellular adhesion and synthetic cell surface tension as key material properties driving successful co-assembly of hybrids. We further demonstrate that these synthetic cells can establish artificial tumor immune microenvironments (ART-TIMEs), mimicking immunogenic signals within tumoroids. Using the ART-TIME approach, we identify co-signaling mechanisms between PD-1 and CD2 as a driver in immune evasion of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Our findings demonstrate the 3D bottom-up self-assembly of hybrid cancer microenvironments to replace immune components with defined bionic materials, pushing the boundaries to functionally integrating living and non-living matter."

Synthetic Biology,A robust synthetic biology toolkit to advance carboxysome study and redesign,"Daniel S.,Y,Anthony G.,Cesar R.,Daniel S.,Y,Anthony G.,Cesar R.,Daniel S.,Y,Anthony G.","Carboxysomes are polyhedral protein organelles that microorganisms use to facilitate carbon dioxide assimilation. They are composed of a modular protein shell which envelops an enzymatic core mainly comprised of physically coupled Rubisco and carbonic anhydrase. While the modular construction principles of carboxysomes make them attractive targets as customizable metabolic platforms, their size and complexity can be a hinderance. In this work, we design and validate a plasmid set – the pXpressome toolkit -in which α-carboxysomes are robustly expressed and remain intact and functional after purification. We tested this toolkit by introducing mutations which influence carboxysome structure and performance. We find that deletion of vertex-capping genes results in formation of larger carboxysomes while deletion of facet forming genes produces smaller particles, suggesting that adjusting the ratio of these proteins can rationally affect morphology. Through a series of fluorescently labeled constructs, we observe this toolkit leads to more uniform expression and better cell health than previously published carboxysome expression systems. Overall, the pXpressome toolkit facilitates the study and redesign of carboxysomes with robust performance and improved phenotype uniformity. The pXpressome toolkit will support efforts to remodel carboxysomes for enhanced carbon fixation or serve as a platform for other nanoencapsulation goals."
Synthetic Biology,High-Throughput Optimization of Paper-Based Cell-Free Biosensors,"David C.,John P.,Charles E.,Daniel A.,Aleksandr E.,Matthew M.,David C.,John P.,Charles E.,Daniel A.,Aleksandr E.,Matthew M.,David C.,John P.,Charles E.,Daniel A.,Aleksandr E.","Cell-free expression systems maintain core cellular processes without intact cells and offer attractive properties as point-of-need biosensors. The ability to lyophilize, store, and use on- demand make these sensors usable in the field, and the lack of membranes means that there are no analyte transport issues and that new sensors can be deployed by simply adding a different DNA molecule. The lack of membranes also means that sensor designs and reaction optimizations can be screened in high throughput. While shelf stability has been demonstrated in specific cases using additives, these approaches are not universal to the myriad cell-free expression methods and formats. Here, we present new high-throughput screening methods to optimize cell-free expression formulations when embedded into paper for use as sensors. Our method leverages acoustic liquid handling to dispense reactions onto 384-well paper ticket formats and machine vision to quantify reaction performance from a colorimetric reporter enzyme. The throughput enabled shifts the bottleneck from experimental execution to selecting the experiments to execute; we therefore implement design-of-experiments to optimize the information gained from each design-build-test-learn cycle. We used these approaches to first optimize the performance of a low-cost cell-free expression formulation that was initially non- functional when embedded in paper, then further optimize it for tolerance to exposure to heat. With only 2 rounds of experimentation lasting 4 days total for each goal, the result are an energy mixture with 8% of the materials cost of a commonly used version and a formulation of excipients that maintain 60% of activity after 6 hours of storage at 50 °C and. Finally, we showcase the use of the cost-optimized formulation in a 3D-printed paperfluidic device where it outperforms the standard formulation at much lower cost."

The drawings heavily relies on the task, so the ecological validity of the conclusions is low; 2. The subjective interpretation of drawings is inevitable. To address these problems, this study uses the Large Language Model (LLM) to identify the drawing contents of 1096 children’s scientific drawings (covering 6 scientific concepts), and uses the word2vec algorithm to calculate their semantic similarity. The study explores whether there are consistent drawing representations among children with the same theme, and attempts to establish a norm for children’s scientific drawings, providing a baseline reference for following children’s drawing research. The results showed that there were significant differences in the consistency of children’s representations of different concepts, and there was a possibility of consistency bias, that is, the appearance of consistency representations misled LLM. At the same time, linear regression tests were used to analyze the relevant factors that affect children’s representation. The results show that sample size and teaching strategies can affect the accuracy of LLM’s image recognition, while the degree of conceptual abstraction may affect the consistency of representation."
Scientific Communication and Education,Statistics in service of metascience: Measuring replication distance with reproducibility rate,"Erkan,Berna,Erkan,Berna,Erkan","Motivated by the recent putative reproducibility crisis, we discuss the relationship between replicability of scientific studies, reproducibility of results obtained in these replications, and the philosophy of statistics. Our approach focuses on challenges in specifying scientific studies for scientific inference via statistical inference, and is complementary to classical discussions in philosophy of statistics. We particularly consider the challenges in replicating studies exactly, using the notion of the idealized experiment. We argue against treating reproducibility as an inherently desirable property of scientific results, and in favor of viewing it as a tool to measure distance between an original study and its replications. To sensibly study the implications of replicability and results reproducibility on inference, such a measure of replication distance is needed. We present an effort to delineate such a framework here, addressing some challenges in capturing the components of scientific studies while identifying others as ongoing issues. We illustrate our measure of replication distance by simulations using a toy example. Rather than replications, we present purposefully planned modifications as an appropriate tool to inform scientific inquiry. Our ability to measure replication distance serves scientists in their search for replication-ready studies. We believe that likelihood-based and evidential approaches may play a critical role towards building a statistics that effectively serves the practical needs of science."

Scientific Communication and Education,Development of the Follow-Up Discourse Observation Protocol (FUDOP) for characterizing instructor active-learning follow-up behaviors,"Xinjian,Maci,Rachel,Petra,Stanley M.,Jeffrey,Melinda T.,Xinjian,Maci,Rachel,Petra,Stanley M.,Jeffrey,Melinda T.,Xinjian,Maci,Rachel,Petra,Stanley M.,Jeffrey","Instructors can provide feedback to their class in multiple ways. One way is through their follow-up behaviors, which are the specific strategies instructors implement after active learning activities. These behaviors could play an important role in student learning as students can receive feedback from the instructor. However, there is little research on the effects of different types of follow-up behaviors. Follow-up after active learning can be seen as a form of discourse between the instructor and the entire class. Previous researchers developed the Classroom Discourse Observation Protocol (CDOP) to analyze discourse between the instructor and individual students or small groups. We used CDOP as a starting point to develop and validate a new protocol, the Follow-Up Discourse Observation Protocol (FUDOP), to characterize instructional follow-up behaviors to the entire class after active-learning activities. We then used FUDOP to characterize follow-up behaviors of multiple instructors in introductory biology courses at three different universities. We measured consistent differences in these behaviors across instructors but not within instructors, demonstrating that instructors may engage in consistent follow-up behaviors. FUDOP could allow instructors and researchers to better measure and analyze follow-up behaviors and their effects, which could in turn provide guidance to instructors and faculty developers."
Scientific Communication and Education,The influence of visual attention on letter recognition and reading acquisition in Arabic,"Alaa,Emmanuel,Dominique,Sylviane,Alaa,Emmanuel,Dominique,Sylviane,Alaa,Emmanuel,Dominique","The present study sets out to explore the cognitive underpinnings of reading acquisition in Arabic. Previous studies have identified phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming as early predictors. However, the graphic complexity of Arabic letters imposes particular constraints on the visual system, which should mobilize visual attention. To test this hypothesis, 101 Arabic-speaking children who just began their formal reading instruction in Arabic were administered tests of syllable and word reading. Their nonverbal reasoning, vocabulary, phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming and letter knowledge were measured. Their visual attention was estimated through tasks of visual attention span. We found that phonological awareness, visual attention span and letter knowledge were associated with reading outcomes. However, regression analyses showed that the relationship between visual attention span and reading disappeared when letter knowledge was taken-into-account. We used structural equation modeling to examine the direct and indirect effects of visual attention span to reading. Results showed that phonological awareness and letter knowledge were significant and independent predictors of reading while visual attention span contributed only indirectly through its influence on letter knowledge. Our findings suggest that beginning readers rely on visual attention to identify and discriminate visually-complex Arabic letters. In turn, more efficient letter identification in children with higher visual attention facilitates reading acquisition. These findings support the cognitive models of word recognition that include visual attention as a component of the reading system. They open new perspectives for cross-language studies, suggesting that visual attention might contribute differently to reading depending on the orthographic system. They also provide a foundation for innovative teaching methodologies in Arabic language education."

Here, we developed a reconstituted system capable of sustainably regenerating all 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), which are major components of the translation system. To achieve this, we needed five types of improvements: 1) optimization of aaRS sequences for efficient translation, 2) optimization of the composition of the translation system to enhance translation, 3) employment of another bacterial AlaRS and SerRS to improve each aminoacylation activity, 4) diminishing the translational inhibition caused by certain aaRS sequences by codon optimization and EF-P addition, and 5) balancing the DNA concentrations of 20 aaRSs to match each requirement. After these improvements, we succeeded in the sustainable regeneration of all 20 aaRSs for up to 20 cycles of 2.5-fold serial dilutions. These methodologies and results provide a substantial advancement toward the realization of self-reproducible artificial systems."

Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 19 health and science journalists, we describe journalists’ awareness of these controversies and the ways in which that awareness, in turn, shapes the practices they use to select, verify, and communicate research. Our findings suggest that journalists’ perceptions of debates in scholarly communication vary widely, with some displaying a highly critical and nuanced understanding and others presenting a more limited awareness. Those with a more in-depth understanding report closely scrutinizing the research they report, carefully vetting the study design, methodology, and analyses. Those with a more limited awareness are more trusting of the peer review system as a quality control system and more willing to rely on researchers when determining what research to report on and how to vet and frame it. We discuss the benefits and risks of these varied perceptions and practices, highlighting the implications for the nature of the research media coverage that reaches the public."
Synthetic Biology,An Expanded Substrate Scope for Cross-Chiral Ligation Enables Efficient Synthesis of Long L-RNAs,"Xuan,Jonathan T.,Xuan,Jonathan T.,Xuan","Despite the growing interest in mirror-image L-oligonucleotides, both as a robust nucleic acid analogue and as an artificial genetic polymer, their broader adoption in research and medicine remains hindered by challenges associated with the synthesis of long sequences, especially for L-RNA. Herein, we present a novel strategy for assembling long L-RNAs via the joining of two or more shorter fragments using cross-chiral ligase ribozymes together with new substrate activation chemistry. We show that 5′-monophosphorylated L-RNA, which is readily prepared by solid phase synthesis, can be activated by chemical attachment of a 5′-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) or diphosphate (ADP), yielding 5′-adenosyl (di-or tri-) phosphate L-RNA. The activation reaction is performed in mild aqueous conditions, proceeds efficiently with short or large L-RNA, and, yielding few biproducts, requires little or no further purification after activation. Importantly, both groups, when added to L-RNA, are compatible with ribozyme-mediated ligation, with the 5′-adenosyl triphosphate permitting rapid and efficient joining of multiple, long L-RNA strands. This is exemplified by the assembly of a 129-nt L-RNA molecule via a single cross-chiral ligation event. Overall, by relying on ribozymes that can be readily prepared by "

We present a method where DNA symbols, or oligos designed to encode information for data storage, are joined to linker sequences at either end. These linkers dictate the assembly order of the symbols; the order of the symbols can be changed by changing the sequences of the linkers attached to them. Utilizing a ligating DNAzyme as a catalytic splint, we achieve room-temperature, enzyme-free assembly, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional enzyme-based ligation methods. We demonstrate this technique by assembling three different five-symbol constructs, with the order of the symbols determined by their linking ends. This linker directed assembly technique allows data-encoding symbols to be assembled in any desired order. Furthermore, the DNAzyme-based assembly method is versatile and can be applied to various DNA assembly applications, particularly where cost-effectiveness and efficient room-temperature ligation are required."
Synthetic Biology,Further characterization and engineering of a 11-amino acid motif for enhancing recombinant protein expression,"Jiawu,Elaine,Weibiao,Fong Tian,Jiawu,Elaine,Weibiao,Fong Tian,Jiawu,Elaine,Weibiao","Background: Recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a widely used system in both academic and industrial research owing to its low cost and wide availability of genetic tools. Despite its advantages, this system still struggles with soluble expression of recombinant proteins. To address this, various solubility-enhancing and yield-improving methods such as the addition of fusion tags have been developed. However, traditional tags such as small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) and Glutathione S-transferase (GST) can interfere with protein folding or require removal post-translation, which adds complexity and cost to production. To circumvent these issues, smaller solubility tags (<10 kDa) are preferred. This study specifically focuses on an 11-amino acid solubility-enhancing tag (NT11) derived from the N-terminal domain of a duplicated carbonic anhydrase from Dunaliella species. Results: A comprehensive analysis was performed to improve the characteristics of the 11-amino acid tag. By investigating the alanine-scan library of NT11, we increased its activity and identified key residues for further development. Screening with the alanine mutant library consistently led to at least a two-fold improvement in protein yield for three different proteins. We also discovered that the NT11 tag is not limited to the N-terminal position and can function at either the N- or C-terminal of the protein, providing flexibility in designing protein expression constructs. With these new insights, we have successfully doubled the recombinant protein yields of valuable growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and an originally low-yielding human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), in E. coli. Conclusion: The further characterisation and development of the NT11 tag have provided valuable insights into the optimization process for such small tags and expanded our understanding of its potential applications. The ability of NT11 tag to be positioned at different locations within the protein construct without compromising its effectiveness to enhance recombinant protein yields, makes it a valuable tool across a diverse range of proteins. Collectively, these findings have the potential to simplify and enhance the efficiency of recombinant protein production."

However, recent sequencing-based studies have indicated that F. necrophorum is positively associated with pregnancy in beef cows and that Fusobacterium is the most abundant genus in the bull seminal microbiota, suggesting the potential role of Fusobacterium in reproductive health and fertility. Here, we performed a comprehensive screening to 1) determine whether Fusobacterium necrophorum (subspecies necrophorum [FNN] and funduliforme [FNF]), and Fusobacterium varium (FV) are part of the commensal members of the reproductive microbiota in cattle; 2) to explore whether these Fusobacterium spp. are colonized in calf prenatally.  For this, we screened 11 different sample types including bovine and ram semen, bovine vaginal and uterine swabs, and bull fecal samples, as well as samples from 180- and 260-days old calf fetuses and their respective dams using both quantitative PCR (514 samples) and targeted culturing (499 samples).  By qPCR, all the targeted Fusobacterium spp. were detected across all sample types, with FNF being the highly prevalent in the bull semen (66.7%) and maternal ruminal fluids (87.1%), which was confirmed by culturing.  All the targeted Fusobacterium were identified in vaginal and uterine (3.1%-9.4%) as well as placental caruncles, and fetal fluids, ruminal and meconium samples (2.7% - 26.3%) by qPCR and were not isolated by culture method.

Having a diverse department is beneficial for undergraduate and graduate students as representation of underrepresented minority groups in the professoriate can inspire a greater diversity of students to pursue higher levels of education or research-focused careers. Increased diversity benefits research directly as diverse teams have been shown to have better ideas and outcomes. In 2020, our department had lower gender diversity than would be expected based on the pool of PhD students and post-doctoral fellows in Canada. Therefore, we altered our hiring process, primarily by redacting applications, for recruitment into entry-level tenure-track faculty positions. With this change in process, female hires increased from 17% in the previous ten years (5 hires) to 80% in the subsequent four years (5 hires) with no substantial change in hiring of racially diverse individuals (50% to 40%). Overall, combined with retirements, the percentage of female faculty in the department went from 25% to 50% and the percentage of racialized faculty went from 38% to 44%. The new hires have met or exceeded expectations of success with respect to grant funding and are on track to meet or exceed expectations for other metrics of success. Thus, our intervention was very successful in increasing the diversity of our department within a short timeframe. We believe that our experience could provide other departments with a template for making substantive change, even in the absence of internal expertise in the area."
Scientific Communication and Education,Features and signals in precocious citation impact: a meta-research study,"John,John","Some scientists reach top citation impact in a very short time once they start publishing. The current analysis defined precocious citation impact as rising to become a top-cited scientist within t≤8 years after the first publication year. Ultra-precocious citation impact was defined similarly for t ≤5 years. Top-cited authors included those in the top-2% of a previously validated composite citation indicator across 174 subfields of science or in the top-100,000 authors of that composite citation indicator across all science based on Scopus. Annual data between 2017 and 2023 show a strong increase over time, with 469 precocious and 66 ultra-precocious citation impact Scopus author IDs in 2023. In-depth assessment of validated ultra-precocious scientists in 2023, showed significantly higher frequency of less developed country affiliation (71%), clustering in 4 high-risk subfields (Environmental Sciences, Energy, Artificial Intelligence & Image Processing, Mechanical Engineering & Transports) (64%), self-citations for their field  above the 95th percentile (31%), being top-cited only when self-citations were included (20%), citations to citing papers ratio for their field above the 95th percentile (15%), extreme publishing behavior (7%), and extreme citation orchestration metric c/h2<2.45 (15%) compared with all top-cited authors (p<0.005 for all signals). The 17 ultra-precocious citation impact authors in the 2017-2020 top-cited lists who had retractions by October 2024 showed on average 4 of these 7 signal indicators at the time they entered the top-cited list. While some authors with precocious citation impact may be stellar scientists, others probably herald massive manipulative or fraudulent behaviors infiltrating the scientific literature."

Microbiology,Emergence and host range expansion of an epidemic lineage of Ralstonia solanacearum,"Daria,Yann,Marek,Catrin,Carolin,Marketa,Elena,Yingguang Frank,Stephane,Emmanuel,Honour C,Daria,Yann,Marek,Catrin,Carolin,Marketa,Elena,Yingguang Frank,Stephane,Emmanuel,Honour C,Daria,Yann,Marek,Catrin,Carolin,Marketa,Elena,Yingguang Frank,Stephane,Emmanuel","Members of the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex are soil-borne pathogens of important crop plants. Strain-level host specialisation is considered typical, yet outbreak monitoring in Martinique revealed a new lineage with dramatically expanded host range had emerged. Our analysis shows the outbreak in Martinique was caused by the expansion of lineages from two different Ralstonia species. One lineage is of Asian origin and retains a signature of host specialisation, while the emergent broad host range lineage originated in the Americas. The presence of similar integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) in both lineages suggests they are exchanging genetic material. The emergent lineage acquired novel prophage along with genes encoding novel catalytic and metabolic functions, but shows little variation among the virulence proteins considered host specificity determinants. We postulate that host range expansion is not caused by the evolution of a virulence strategy targeting host immunity, but is rather due to the acquisition of novel pathways for substrate metabolism enhancing pathogen fitness in soil or plant tissues."

Constantly secreted into the lumen of the intestine, IgA binds commensal microbiota to regulate their colonization and function(2,3) with unclear implications for health. IgA deficiency is common in humans but is difficult to study due to its complex aetiology and comorbidities(4-8). Using genetically and environmentally controlled mice, here we show that IgA-deficient animals have increased susceptibility to endogenous colorectal tumours. Cellular and molecular analyses revealed that, in the absence of IgA, colonic epithelial cells induce antibacterial factors and accelerate cell cycling in response to the microbiota. Oral treatment with IgA was sufficient to both reduce steady-state proliferation and protect mice from tumours, but this function was due to antibody structure rather than binding specificity. In both organoid and monolayer culture systems, IgA directly suppressed epithelial growth. Co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and a targeted CRISPR screen identified DMBT1 as an IgA-binding epithelial surface protein required for IgA-mediated suppression of proliferation. Together, IgA and DMBT1 regulate Notch signalling and tune the normal cycling of absorptive colonocyte progenitors. In mice, deleting the transmembrane and cytoplasmic signalling portions of DMBT1 or blocking Notch signalling was sufficient to reverse both the increased proliferation and tumour susceptibility of IgA knockouts. These experiments establish a homeostatic function for IgA in tempering physiological epithelial responses to microbiota to maintain mucosal health."
Microbiology,Microbiota from young mice counteracts susceptibility to age-related gout through modulating butyric acid levels in aged mice,"Ning,Hang,Jianhao,Yi,Mingze,Zhiming,Naisheng,Wenlong,Ning,Hang,Jianhao,Yi,Mingze,Zhiming,Naisheng,Wenlong,Ning,Hang,Jianhao,Yi,Mingze,Zhiming,Naisheng","Gout is a prevalent form of inflammatory arthritis that occurs due to high levels of uric acid in the blood leading to the formation of urate crystals in and around the joints, particularly affecting the elderly. Recent research has provided evidence of distinct differences in the gut microbiota of patients with gout and hyperuricemia when compared to healthy individuals. However, the link between gut microbiota and age-related gout remained underexplored. Our study found that gut microbiota plays a crucial role in determining susceptibility to age-related gout. Specifically, we observed that age-related gut microbiota regulated the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and modulated uric acid metabolism. More scrutiny highlighted the positive impact of ""younger"" microbiota on the gut microbiota structure of old or aged mice, enhancing butanoate metabolism and butyric acid content. Experimentation with butyrate supplementation indicated that butyric acid exerts a dual effect, inhibiting inflammation in acute gout and reducing serum uric acid levels. These insights emphasize the potential of gut microbiome rejuvenation in mitigating senile gout, unraveling the intricate dynamics between microbiota, aging, and gout. It potentially serves as a therapeutic target for senile gout-related conditions."
Immunology,Cardiolipin Inhibits the Noncanonical Inflammasome by Preventing LPS Binding to Caspase 4/11 to Mitigate Endotoxemia in Vivo,"Malvina,Mercedes,Sabrina Sofia,Jakub,Melan,Jing Rong,Emmanuelle,Joanna,Monalisa,Kirsten M.,Jared R.,Masahiro,Si Ming,Petr,Pablo,Kate,Malvina,Mercedes,Sabrina Sofia,Jakub,Melan,Jing Rong,Emmanuelle,Joanna,Monalisa,Kirsten M.,Jared R.,Masahiro,Si Ming,Petr,Pablo,Kate,Malvina,Mercedes,Sabrina Sofia,Jakub,Melan,Jing Rong,Emmanuelle,Joanna,Monalisa,Kirsten M.,Jared R.,Masahiro,Si Ming,Petr,Pablo","In Gram-negative bacterial sepsis, excessive caspase 4/11 activation in response to circulating bacterial lipid LPS (endotoxemia) can cause organ damage and mortality. Current inhibitors of caspase 4/11 also block caspase 1 activity and are therefore not appealing clinical candidates for treating Gram-negative sepsis. Here, we identify double-unsaturated 18:2 cardiolipin as a selective inhibitor of caspase 4/11-dependent inflammatory cytokine secretion and pyroptosis, without affecting caspase-1 responses. Cardiolipin targets the CARD domain of caspase 4/11, impeding its interaction with LPS to restrain caspase 4/11 activation, thereby suppressing endotoxemia-induced systemic inflammation in vivo. Thus, we present cardiolipin as a promising candidate for preventing endotoxemia-induced sequelae in sepsis while preserving caspase-1-driven anti-microbial immune responses. By identifying cardiolipin as a specific caspase 4/11 inhibitor, we provide an urgently-needed tool for studying caspase 4/11 functions in inflammatory pathways, and open the way to studies of noncanonical inflammasome regulation by endogenous cardiolipin."
Systems Biology,Biotic resistance predictably shifts microbial invasion regimes,"Xiaozhou,Or,Christoph,Xiaozhou,Or,Christoph,Xiaozhou,Or","Invading new territory is a central aspect of the microbial lifestyle, allowing microbes to expand to remote locations and pathogens to spread and infect their hosts. However, invading microbes rarely find novel territories uninhabited. In such a scenario, resident microbes can interact with the newcomers and, in many cases, impede their invasion, an effect known as biotic resistance. Accordingly, invasions are shaped by the interplay between dispersal and resistance. However, these two factors are difficult to disentangle or manipulate in natural systems, making their interplay difficult to understand. To address this challenge, we tracked microbial invasions in the lab over space and time, first in a model system of two interacting microbes, then in a multi-strain system involving a pathogen invading resident communities. In the presence of biotic resistance, we observed three qualitatively different invasion regimes: consistent, pulsed, and pinned, where, in the third regime, strong biotic resistance stalled the invasion entirely despite ongoing invader dispersal. Surprisingly, these rich invasion dynamics could be qualitatively predicted with a simple, parameter-free framework that ignores individual species interactions, even for rather complex communities. Moreover, we showed that this simple framework could accurately predict simulated invasions from different mechanistic models, indicating its broad applicability. Our work offers a thorough understanding of how biotic resistance impacts invasions and introduces a predictive tool to identify invasion-resistant communities."
Microbiology,Fast Evolution of SOS-Independent Multi-Drug Resistance in Bacteria,"Le,Yunpeng,Yuen Yee,Nural N,Amy,Andrew,Elizabeth,Antoine M,Qian Peter,Dayong,Le,Yunpeng,Yuen Yee,Nural N,Amy,Andrew,Elizabeth,Antoine M,Qian Peter,Dayong,Le,Yunpeng,Yuen Yee,Nural N,Amy,Andrew,Elizabeth,Antoine M,Qian Peter","The killing mechanism of many antibiotics involves the induction of DNA damage, either directly or indirectly, which triggers the SOS response. RecA, the master regulator of the SOS response, plays a crucial role in driving the evolution of resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics treated with a single dose of ciprofloxacin. However, the precise roles of RecA and SOS responses in the development of resistance under short-term β-lactam exposure remain unclear. In the present study, we observed a fast evolution of β-lactam resistance (20-fold) increase in MIC in 8 hours) in E. coli after deleting RecA and exposing the bacteria to a single dose of ampicillin. Notably, once this type of resistance is established, it remains stable and can be passed on to subsequent generations. Unlike earlier studies, we found that the rapid development of resistance relies on the hindrance of DNA repair, a mechanism that operates independently of the SOS response. Additionally, we identified the rapid emergence of drug resistance associated mutations in the resistant bacterial genome, indicating the impairment of DNA repair. Through comprehensive transcriptome sequencing, we discovered that the expression of numerous antioxidative response genes is repressed in recA mutant resistant isolates, resulting in an excessive accumulation of ROS within the cells. This suggests that the induction of ROS drives the fast evolution of antibiotic resistance in RecA-deficient bacteria. 
Collectively, we show that the hindrance of DNA repair hampers cellular fitness, provides bacteria with genetic adaptability to survive in diverse stressful environments, and accelerates the evolution of antibiotic resistance."
Systems Biology,Systems-level analysis provides insights on methanol-based production of L-glutamate and its decarboxylation product γ-aminobutyric acid by Bacillus methanolicus,"Marta,Ingemar,David,Trygve,Tobias,Dušan,Carsten,Stéphanie,Gregor,Christian,Volker F,Luciana,Cláudia M,Marta,Ingemar,David,Trygve,Tobias,Dušan,Carsten,Stéphanie,Gregor,Christian,Volker F,Luciana,Cláudia M,Marta,Ingemar,David,Trygve,Tobias,Dušan,Carsten,Stéphanie,Gregor,Christian,Volker F,Luciana","Background
Bacillus methanolicus is the next workhorse in biotechnology using methanol, an alternative and economical one-carbon feedstock that can be obtained directly from carbon dioxide, as both carbon and energy source for the production of various value-added chemicals. The wild-type strain B. methanolicus MGA3 naturally overproduces L-glutamate in methanol-based fed-batch fermentations.
Results
Here we generated, by induced mutagenesis, an evolved B. methanolicus strain exhibiting enhanced L-glutamate production capability (>150%). To showcase the potential of this evolved strain, further metabolic engineering enabled the production of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) directly from L-glutamate, with a yield of 13.2 g/L from methanol during fed-batch fermentations. By using a systems-level analysis, encompassing whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, fluxome analysis and genome-scale metabolic modelling, we were able to elucidate the metabolic and regulatory adaptations that sustain the biosynthesis of these products. The metabolism of the mutant strain evolved to prioritize energy conservation and efficient carbon utilization. Key metabolic shifts include the downregulation of energy-intensive processes such as flagellation and motility and the rerouting of carbon fluxes towards α-ketoglutarate and its derivative, L-glutamate. Moreover, we observed that transformation of the evolved strain with a GABA biosynthesis plasmid had a positive effect on L-glutamate production, likely due to an upregulation of various transaminases involved in the L-glutamate biosynthesis from α-ketoglutarate.
Conclusions
These results and insights provide a foundation for further rational metabolic engineering and bioprocess optimization, enhancing the industrial viability of B. methanolicus for sustainable production of L-glutamate and its derivatives."
Systems Biology,Lowering the switching cost related to the activation of burdensome gene circuits promotes cell population homogeneity and productivity,"Lucas,Vincent,Juan Andres Martinez,Julian,Samuel,Andrew,Frank,Lucas,Vincent,Juan Andres Martinez,Julian,Samuel,Andrew,Frank,Lucas,Vincent,Juan Andres Martinez,Julian,Samuel,Andrew","The activation of gene circuits can impose a significant burden on cells, leading to heterogeneous expression and reduced productivity. In this work, we focused on the T7 production system in E. coli BL21, a prime example of a burdensome gene circuit, to investigate the main cause for this gene expression heterogeneity and methods to mitigate it. Based on continuous cultivation analyzed and control by automated flow cytometry, we quantified the trade-off between cellular growth and gene expression and tracked the cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression (measured as entropy). We concluded that the growth reduction associated to the activation of the burdensome gene circuit, i.e., the switching cost, is at the origin of the population heterogeneity. The loss of growth rate imposed by the burdensome activation of the gene is compensated at the population level by the overgrowth of less induced cells that safeguard the population by generating entropy. We tried to homogenize the population by pulsing the inducer with increasing frequency but found that the population escapes control through promoter mutation, leading to a genotype exhibiting reduced gene expression, but also, reduced entropy. To engineer a more homogeneous population without sacrificing gene expression, we decreased the switching cost associated to the induction by lowering the quality of the main carbon source. This strategy successfully led to a more homogeneous and productive population. Our approach allows for a precise quantification of the trade-off between growth and gene expression in cell population cultivated under dynamic conditions and highlights the importance of the switching cost for designing efficient approaches of cell population control."

We identified overexpression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells that survive cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) exposure, suggesting a mechanism of CTL resistance. Inhibition of EZH2 with the FDA-approved drug tazemetostat increased surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) on CD4+ T-cells, counterbalancing HIV Nef-mediated MHC-I downregulation. This improved CTL-mediated elimination of HIV-infected cells and suppressed viral replication in vitro. In a participant-derived xenograft mouse model, tazemetostat elevated MHC-I and the pro-apoptotic protein BIM in CD4+ T-cells, facilitating CD8+ T-cell-mediated reductions of HIV reservoir seeding. Additionally, tazemetostat promoted sustained skewing of CD8+ T-cells toward less differentiated and exhausted phenotypes. Our findings reveal EZH2 overexpression as a novel mechanism of CTL resistance and support the clinical evaluation of tazemetostat to enhance clearance of HIV reservoirs and improve CD8+ T-cell function."

During prolonged antibiotic treatment of chronic infections, the antimicrobial pressure facilitates selection of antibiotic resistance mutations. It has been suggested that using antibiotics in combinations may reduce the emergence of resistance. Furthermore, antibiotic tolerant persister cells may be a reservoir for resistance development, so targeting persister cells with anti-persister drugs could also reduce the emergence of resistance. "

One key marker of AD is the hyperphosphorylation of Tau, accompanied by altered levels of Tau isoforms. However, an imbalance in these Tau splice variants, specifically resulting from altered 3R to 4R MAPT splicing of exon 10, has yet to be directly associated with HSV-1 infection
METHODS: To this end, we infected 2D and 3D human neural models with HSV-1 and monitored MAPT splicing and Tau phosphorylation. Further, we transduced SH-SY5Y-neurons with HSV-1 ICP27 which alters RNA splicing to analyze if ICP27 alone is sufficient to induce altered MAPT exon 10 splicing. 
RESULTS: We show that HSV-1 infection induces altered splicing of MAPT exon 10, increasing 4R-Tau protein levels, Tau hyperphosphorylation, and Tau oligomerization. 
DISCUSSION: Our experiments reveal a novel link between HSV-1 infection and the development of cytopathic phenotypes linked with AD progression."

Here we identify two independently active tripeptide pharmacophores within PEPITEM and engineered peptidomimetics with enhanced pharmacodynamic properties. These peptidomimetics regulate T-cell trafficking in vitro and reduce T-cell, neutrophil and macrophage numbers in the inflamed peritoneal cavity in vivo. In a plaque psoriasis model, topical administration reduced disease severity, inflammation and immune cell infiltration, while regulating cytokine release in macrophages and fibroblasts, as well as keratinocyte proliferation. Th1 and Th17 cell abundance, along with their cytokines, was reduced in secondary lymphoid organs. This expanded functional repertoire of PEPITEM and its derivatives provides innovative tools for countering immune and stromal cell-induced pathology in IMIDs, paving the way for a novel class of anti-inflammatory agents."

In this work, we compare and contrast intranasal (i.n.) and intramuscular (i.m.) administration of a SARS-CoV-2 self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine delivered by a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC). Both i.m. and i.n. vaccines induce potent systemic serum neutralizing antibodies, bone marrow-resident IgG-secreting cells, and splenic T cell responses. The i.n. vaccine additionally induces robust respiratory mucosal immune responses, including SARS-CoV-2-reactive lung-resident memory and lung-homing T cell populations. As a booster following previous i.m. vaccination, the i.n. vaccine also elicits the development of mucosal virus-specific T cells. Both the i.m. and i.n. administered vaccines durably protect hamsters from infection-associated morbidity upon viral challenge, significantly reducing viral loads and preventing challenged hamsters from transmitting virus to naive cagemates. This saRNA-NLC vaccine's potent systemic immunogenicity, and additional mucosal immunogenicity when delivered i.n., may be key for combating SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens."

Cholesterol sulfate (CS) is a bioactive metabolite that inhibits leukocyte migration and activation. This study investigated the roles and cells associated with CS in pregnant mice and humans. CS was sequentially produced by maternal-derived endometrial cells and fetal-derived placental trophoblasts before and after placentation. When mated with allogeneic males, CS-deficient mice showed increased fetal resorption rates under induced placental inflammation. This phenotype disappeared when the activity of the CS-producing enzyme was restored in the placenta. Placental CS levels were reduced in patients with ""villitis of unknown etiology."" Thus, we uncovered the spatiotemporal control of CS production and its relevance to local immunosuppression during pregnancy."

In this study, we present a theoretical framework for investigating cell death. We conceptualize cell death as a controllability problem within dynamical systems, and compute the life-death boundary through the development of “stoichiometric rays”. This method utilizes enzyme activity as control parameters, exploiting the inherent property of enzymes to enhance reaction rates without affecting thermodynamic potentials. This approach facilitates the efficient evaluation of the global controllability of models. We demonstrate the utility of our framework using its application to a toy metabolic model, where we delineate the life-death boundary. The formulation of cell death through mathematical principles provides a foundation for the theoretical study of cellular mortality."

To predict community function and composition beyond statistical correlations, one can use genome-scale metabolic models. However, comprehensive model analysis via metabolic pathways is a major challenge because pathway counts grow combinatorially with model size. Here, we define minimal pathways that yield compact representations of metabolic network capabilities. They generalize existing pathway concepts by allowing inhomogeneous constraints and targeted analysis of subnetworks, and we show how to enumerate and sample them efficiently via iterative minimization and pathway graphs.

Systems Biology,SOX10 and microRNAs: decoding their interplay in regulating melanoma plasticity,"Xin,Chunyan,Zhesi,Anja,Markus V.,Carola,Julio,Xin,Chunyan,Zhesi,Anja,Markus V.,Carola,Julio,Xin,Chunyan,Zhesi,Anja,Markus V.,Carola","Recent studies show that the dysregulation of the transcription factor SOX10 is essential for development and progression of melanoma. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can regulate the expression of transcription factors at the post-transcriptional level. The interactions between SOX10 and its targeting miRNAs form network motifs such as feedforward and feedback loops. Such motifs can result in non-linear dynamics in gene expression levels, therefore playing a crucial role in regulating tumor proliferation and metastasis as well as tumor’s responses to therapies. Here, we reviewed and discussed the intricate interplay between SOX10 and miRNAs in melanoma biology including melanogenesis, phenotype switch, and therapy resistance. Additionally, we investigated the gene regulatory interactions in melanoma, identifying crucial network motifs that involve both SOX10 and miRNAs. We also analyzed the expression levels of the components within these motifs. From a control theory perspective, we explained how these dynamics are linked to the phenotypic plasticity of melanoma cells. In summary, we underscored the importance of employing a data-driven network biology approach to elucidate the complex regulatory mechanisms and identify driver network motifs within the melanoma network. This methodology facilitates a deeper understanding of the regulation of SOX10 by miRNAs in melanoma. The insight gained could potentially contribute to the development of miRNA-based treatments for SOX10, thereby enhancing the clinical management of this malignancy."

Interestingly, although the PRRSV family exhibits considerable genome variability, with the PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 subtypes having been finally classified in two different species (Betaarterivirus suid 1 and 2). Both viruses, as well as their derived-attenuated vaccine strains, persist for months, due in part to their ability to delay the appearance of neutralizing antibodies. Thanks to extensive efforts over the past years, we have developed the capability to perform in-depth analysis of the previously poorly understood porcine inverted lymph node (LN). In this study, by comparing the early stages of LN B cell maturation upon PRRSV-1 infection to those induced upon the acute swine influenza A virus infection, we highlighted PRRSV-specific mechanisms, including the expression of PD-L1 in efferent macrophages, the induction of extrafollicular plasmocytes, and the influx of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages. Studies on PRRSV-2 infections report observations compatible with our results, that thus might be generalized to all PRRSV-strains. Moreover, these mechanisms can be compared with those used by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the murine chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) to hijack the immune response.

Systems Biology,Regulation of replication timing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Rosie,Eamonn,Francisco,Michael A,Rosie,Eamonn,Francisco,Michael A,Rosie,Eamonn,Francisco","In order to maintain genomic integrity, DNA replication must be highly coordinated. Disruptions in this process can cause replication stress which is aberrant in many pathologies including cancer. Despite this, little is known about the mechanisms governing the temporal regulation of DNA replication initiation, thought to be related to the limited copy number of firing factors. Here, we present a high (1-kilobase) resolution stochastic model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae whole-genome replication in which origins compete to associate with limited firing factors. After developing an algorithm to fit this model to replication timing data, we validated the model by reproducing experimental inter-origin distances, origin efficiencies, and replication fork directionality. This suggests the model accurately simulates the aspects of DNA replication most important for determining its dynamics. We also use the model to predict measures of DNA replication dynamics which are yet to be determined experimentally and investigate the potential impacts of variations in firing factor concentrations on DNA replication."

Characterizing the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is crucial for understanding relapsed/refractory disease. However, the complex and diverse nature of the TME has impeded progress. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing(scRNA-seq), we explored the DLBCL landscape at single-cell resolution, profiling 77,344 cells from both primary and relapsed DLBCL patients. We further investigated the shared and distinct molecular and cellular features of tumor microenvironment in both primary and relapsed DLBCL tumors by integrating next-generation DNA sequencing data and multiple scRNA-seq datasets from total 72,351 cells. Our results demonstrated that there was a significant decrease of CD4+CXCR5+PD-1- Tfh cells, along with excessive activation of the TNF-NFκB signaling pathways in malignant B cells in R/R disease. Furthermore, by using multiplex IHC, we confirmed that CD4+CXCR5+PD-1- Tfh cells are prognostic and predictive biomarkers for response to R-CHOP treatment. As a proof of concept, we successfully generated mutilplexed images of CD4+CXCR5+PD-1- Tfh cells from a single DAPI staining in human DLBCL tissues through using generative artificial intelligence. Our study offers critical insights into the heterogeneity and molecular features of DLBCL, shedding light on the crucial role of CD4+CXCR5+PD-1- Tfh cells in the recurrent process."

Dysregulation of this system has been implicated in genetic diseases and cancers affecting diverse tissues. To better understand the regulation of this system, we employed information flow analysis based on transfer entropy (TE) between the activation dynamics of two key elements in cells stimulated with EGF: SOS, a guanine nucleotide exchanger for the small GTPase RAS, and RAF, a RAS effector serine/threonine kinase. TE analysis allows for model-free assessment of the timing, direction, and strength of the information flow regulating the system response. We detected significant amounts of TE in both directions between SOS and RAF, indicating feedback regulation. Importantly, the amount of TE did not simply follow the input dose or the intensity of the causal reaction, demonstrating the uniqueness of TE. TE analysis proposed regulatory networks containing multiple tracks and feedback loops and revealed temporal switching in the reaction pathway primarily responsible for reaction control. This proposal was confirmed by the effects of a MEK inhibitor on TE. Furthermore, TE analysis identified the functional disorder of a SOS mutation associated with Noonan syndrome, a human genetic disease, of which the pathogenic mechanism has not been precisely known yet. TE assessment holds significant promise as a model-free analysis method of reaction networks in molecular pharmacology and pathology."

Its immunomodulatory function has curious attributes - paradoxically opposing host responses using different host receptors resulting in immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive propertis depending on the size/length of the oligomers as well as aceytylation levels have been reported in literature.  Here we demonstrate that Hepta-N-Acetyl Chitoheptaose (7 mer) is a TLR2 ligand,  8 mer activates immune cells through TLR4 while, 6 mer is a relatively poor ligand for both TLR2 and TLR4 in generating inflammatory host cytokines.  Significantly enhanced inflammatory response characterized by increased TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-10 was a feature of only 8 mer while, 6 and 7 mers induced modest activation in both HEK cells (transfected with specific TLRs) and in human THP2 cells in vitro. The translational significance of these features were addressed in an experimental model of Sepsis using Cecal Ligation Puncture (CLP) protocol, a murine model, considered a gold standard for human Sepsis. More significantly, therapeutic rather than prophylactic administration, that simulates real life scenerio of human and animal sepsis, of 7 mer rather than 6 or 8 residues of Chitin oligomer, significantly protected mice against sepsis as shown by decreased mortality and decreased induction of inflammatory cytokines. These findings suggest that modulation of immune response by chitopolysaccarides in-vivo is precisely caliberated."

Recent discoveries of AxSpA-specific T cell receptor (TCR) motifs and the self and bacterial peptides that they recognize support a pathogenic role of CD8+ T cells. Despite of previous work on synovial fluid, the characteristics of CD8 cells in joint tissue are currently unknown.
Method: Synovial tissues from 5 AxSpA patients were used for single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq). Paired TCR sequencing was carried out for 2. The abundance of KIR+ CD8+ T cells in the blood from 9 AxSpA patients and 10 healthy controls was measured using flow cytometry. The expression of naive and memory T cell markers (CCR7, CD45RA and CD45RO) were compared between KIR+ and KIR- CD8 cells.
Results: We observed conventional, TRAV1-2+ mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cell and MKI67+ proliferating cell populations in synovium. Following sub-clustering of conventional CD8+ T cells, HLA-DR+ tissue resident memory (TRM), circulating, KIR+ and FCGR3A+ (encoding CD16) cell subsets were observed. HLA-DR+ TRM and KIR+ cells were clonally expanded and exhibited distinct transcriptional features, enriched for T cell activation pathways and natural killer (NK) cell mediated cytotoxicity pathway respectively. Lastly, KIR+CD8+ T cells were increased in AxSpA blood and enriched for CD45RA+CCR7- TEMRA cells.
Conclusion: Here we present the very first transcriptomic profiling of CD8+ T cells in synovium tissue and highlight potential roles of HLA-DR+ TRM and KIR+ cells in AxSpA pathology. This study adds novel insights to the disease mechanisms and offers new therapeutic opportunities."
Systems Biology,Predicting treatment-free remission outcomes in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia patients using an integrated model of tumor-immune dynamics,"Artur C.,Ingo,Ingmar,Artur C.,Ingo,Ingmar,Artur C.,Ingo","The interactions between tumor and the immune system are main factors in determining cancer treatment outcomes. In Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), considerable evidence shows that the dynamics between residual leukemia and the patient’s immune system can result in either sustained disease control, leading to treatment-free remission (TFR), or disease recurrence. The question remains how to integrate mechanistic and data-driven models to support prediction of treatment outcomes. Starting from classical ecological modeling concepts, which allow to explicitly account for immune interactions at the cellular level, we incorporate time-course data on natural killer (NK) cell number, function, and their tumor-induced suppression into a model of CML treatment. We identify relevant time scales governing treatment and immune response, enabling refined model calibration using tumor and NK cell time courses from different datasets. While the model successfully describes patient-specific response dynamics, critical parameters for predicting treatment outcome remain uncertain. However, by explicitly incorporating tumor load changes in response to TKI dose alterations, these parameters can be estimated and used to derive model predictions for treatment cessation. Further exploring dynamic changes in the number of functional immune cells, we suggest specific measurement strategies of immune effector cell populations to enhance prediction accuracy for CML recurrence following treatment cessation. The generalizability and flexibility of our approach represent a significant step towards quantitative, personalized medicine that integrates tumor-immune dynamics to guide clinical decisions and optimize dynamic cancer therapies."

However, the mechanisms of evolving antimicrobial resistance in such polymicrobial environments are poorly understood. We previously reported that magnesium depletion caused by the fungus Candida albicans can enable Pseudomonas aeruginosa to acquire significant resistance to colistin, a last-resort antibiotic targeting bacterial membrane. Here, we dissect the genetic and biochemical basis of this increased colistin resistance. We show that P. aeruginosa cells can acquire colistin resistance using three distinct evolutionary trajectories involving mutations in genes involved in lipid A biosynthesis, lipid A modifications that are dependent on low Mg2+, and a putative Mg2+ transporter, PA4824. These mutations confer colistin resistance by altering acyl chains, hydroxylation, and aminoarabinose modification of lipid A moieties on the bacterial outer membrane. In all cases, enhanced colistin resistance initially depends on the low Mg2+-responsive PhoPQ pathway, which potentiates the evolution of resistance mutations and lipid A modifications that do not occur without Mg2+ depletion. However, the PhoPQ pathway is not required to maintain high colistin resistance in all cases. In most cases, the genetic and biochemical changes associated with these novel forms of colistin resistance also impair bacterial membrane integrity, leading to fitness costs. Our findings provide molecular insights into how nutritional competition drives a novel antibiotic resistance mechanism and its ensuing fitness tradeoffs."

Microbiology,About bacteriophage tail terminator and tail completion proteins: structure of the proximal extremity of siphophage T5 tail,"Romain,Cecile,Romain,Cecile,Romain","Bacteriophages are viruses infecting bacteria. The vast majority of them bear a tail, allowing host recognition, cell wall perforation and DNA injection into the host cytoplasm. Using electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) and single particle analysis, we determined the organisation of the tail proximal extremity of siphophage T5 that possess a long flexible tail, and solved the structure of its tail terminator protein (TrP) p142 (TrP142). It allowed to confirm the common evolutionary origin between T5 TrPp142 and other known or putative TrPs from siphophages, myophages and bacterial tail-like machines, despite very poor sequence conservation. By also determining the structure of T5 tail proximal extremity after interaction with T5 bacterial receptor FhuA, we showed that no conformational changes occur in TrPp142 and confirmed that the infection signal transduction is not carried by the tube itself. We also investigated the location of T5 tail completion protein (TCP) p143 (TCPp143) and showed, thanks to a combination of cryo-EM and structure prediction using Alphafold2, that it is not located at the capsid-to-tail interface as suggested by its position in the genome, but instead, very unexpectedly, on the side of T5 tail tip, and that it appears to be monomeric. Based on structure comparison with other putative TCPs predicted structures, this feature could not be shared by other TCPs. The stoichiometry of the Tape Measure Protein is also discussed."

Microbiology,TaRTLEt: Transcriptionally-active Riboswitch Tracer Leveraging Edge deTection,"Sachit,Sarah C.,Sachit,Sarah C.,Sachit","Structured RNAs have emerged as a major component of cellular regulatory systems, but their mechanism of action is often poorly understood. Riboswitches are structured RNAs that allosterically regulate gene expression through any of several different mechanisms. In vitro approaches to characterizing mechanism are costly, low-throughput, and must be repeated for each individual riboswitch locus of interest. Bioinformatic methods promise higher throughput; despite robust computational identification of riboswitches, however, computational classification of riboswitch mechanism has so far been both model-bound, relying on identification of sequence motifs known to be required for specific models of riboswitch activity, and empirically untested, with predictions far outpacing biological validation. Here, we introduce TaRTLEt (Transcriptionally-active Riboswitch Tracer Leveraging Edge deTection), a new high-throughput tool that recovers in vivo patterns of riboswitch-mediated transcription termination from paired-end RNA-seq data using edge detection methods. TaRTLEt successfully extracts transcription termination signals despite numerous sources of biological and technical noise. We tested the effectiveness of TaRTLEt on riboswitches identified from a wide range of sequenced bacterial taxa by utilizing publicly available paired-end RNA-seq readsets, finding broad agreement with previously published in vitro characterization results. In addition, we use TaRTLEt to infer the in vivo regulatory mechanism of uncharacterized riboswitch loci from existing public data. TaRTLEt is available on GitHub and can be applied to paired-end RNA-seq datasets from isolates or complex communities."
Microbiology,RNAi epimutations conferring antifungal drug resistance are inheritable,"Carlos,María Isabel,Ziyan,Grit,Joseph,Carlos,María Isabel,Ziyan,Grit,Joseph,Carlos,María Isabel,Ziyan,Grit","Epimutations modify gene expression and lead to phenotypic variation, although the encoding DNA sequence remains unchanged. Epimutations mediated by RNA interference (RNAi) and/or chromatin modifications can confer antifungal drug resistance and may impact virulence traits in fungi. However, whether these epigenetic modifications can be transmitted across generations following sexual reproduction was unclear. This study demonstrates that RNAi epimutations conferring antifungal drug resistance are transgenerationally inherited in the human fungal pathogen Mucor circinelloides. Our research reveals that RNAi-based antifungal resistance follows a DNA sequence-independent, non-Mendelian inheritance pattern. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are the exclusive determinants of inheritance, transmitting drug resistance independently of other known repressive epigenetic modifications. Unique sRNA signature patterns can be traced through inheritance from parent to progeny, further supporting RNA as an alternative molecule for transmitting information across generations. This study marks a significant advance in understanding epigenetic inheritance, highlighting RNAi-exclusive epimutations as a widespread phenomenon in the pathogenic M. circinelloides species complex. Understanding how epimutations occur, propagate, and confer resistance may enable their detection in other eukaryotic pathogens, provide solutions for challenges posed by rising antimicrobial drug resistance (AMR), and also advance research on phenotypic adaptability and its evolutionary implications."
Microbiology,Systematic annotation of hyper-variability hotspots in phage genomes and plasmids,"Artyom A.,Vasili,Gemma C.,Artyom A.,Vasili,Gemma C.,Artyom A.,Vasili","Bacterial and bacteriophage genomes contain genomic regions of hyper-variability (diversity hotspots) caused by insertions of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), non-homologous recombination events and non-horizontal hypermutation. Accessory genes encoded in the diversity hotspots are involved in anti-MGE defence and counter-defence, virulence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), thus playing key roles in interactions amongst phages, MGEs, bacteria and eukaryotic hosts. To date the majority of research has been focused on either individual hotspots or on relatively limited sets of hotspots in a small set of genomes, typically from a single species. A global understanding of hotspot diversity and dynamics still lacking. To address this gap, we developed iLund4u, an algorithm for the systematic annotation of hotspots across millions of sequences. Using a proteome composition approach, iLund4u detects proteome communities, annotates accessory proteins and identifies hotspots. By analysing 873K phage genomes and 696K plasmid sequences we identified 13.7K hotspots and 171K diverse protein families encoded there as cargo. Furthermore, iLund4u allows for protein search and proteome annotation functions versus a precomputed iLund4u database. In the protein search mode iLund4u identifies all hotspots that encode homologues of a query protein. In the proteome annotation mode iLund4u annotates hotspots by searching for communities of similar proteomes. Detailed documentation, user guide and the source code are available at the iLund4u home page: art-egorov.github.io/ilund4u."
Systems Biology,A global resource constrained model to predict metabolic flux dynamics in fluctuating environments,"Huili,Yang,Xiongfei,Huili,Yang,Xiongfei,Huili,Yang","Environmental changes often induce global variations on bacterial gene expression, frequently accompanied by alterations in growth rates. Integrating non-metabolic cellular processes, such as gene expression and macromolecule synthesis, with metabolic modeling remains a significant challenge in systems biology due to the lack of mechanistic representation of gene regulation. Here, we introduce a novel constraint-based modeling framework called dynamic Constrained Allocation Flux Balance Analysis (dCAFBA), which comprehensively integrates metabolism, cellular resource allocation, and gene regulation. We employ a quasi-steady-state assumption, positing that reaction fluxes achieve balance at each time step, adapting more rapidly than protein synthesis and growth dilution. This approach enables the prediction of reaction flux dynamics and protein allocation necessary to achieve cellular objectives, such as optimizing growth during various growth shifts (including carbon, amino acid, and transcriptional signal), without detailing molecular gene regulations. Our model offers a new method for interpreting proteome allocation and cellular metabolism in complex and transient environments, providing mechanistic insights valuable for metabolic engineering."

We aimed to identify its cellular source in synovial tissue from patients with Axial SpA (AxSpA) and Psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Methods: Synovial tissue from patients with SpA was profiled using single-cell RNA sequencing(scRNA-seq: AxSpA, n=5 and PsA, n=6) or spatial RNA profiling (PsA, n=4). CellPhoneDB was used to infer cell-cell communication. Tissue resident memory Th17 (TRM17)-like cells were generated in vitro using blood memory CD4+ T cells from SpA patients. An epigenetic inhibitor library, siRNA and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) were used to identify epigenetic regulator(s) for TRM17. Results: scRNA-seq showed that IL-17A expression in SpA synovium was restricted to CD4+CXCR6+ TRM17 cells. Cell-cell communication and single-cell spatial analysis support the interaction between TRM17 and CLEC10A+ dendritic cells, which were activated in SpA. Both sublining and lining fibroblasts in SpA synovium exhibited an enhanced IL-17A response signature. TRM17-like cells generated in vitro phenocopied the TRM17 found in joint tissue and produced IL-17A in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation but not cytokines. IL-23 enhanced TCR-mediated IL-17F and IFN-gamma; but not IL-17A production. Perturbation of BRD1 inhibited the generation of TRM17-like cells. Conclusions: CD4+ TRM17 cells are the predominant source of IL-17A in SpA. The TCR stimulation is essential for the secretion of IL-17A by TRM17-like cells. The epigenetic regulator BRD1 contributes to the generation of TRM17. Depleting TRM17 cells in SpA is a therapeutic strategy with potential to induce longterm remission."

While oxygenated oceans are a known methane source, it is argued that methanogenesis is driven by methylphosphonate-degrading bacteria or potentially is associated to zooplankton gut microbiomes rather than by methanogenic archaea. Here we show through in situ monitoring and ex situ manipulations that methane is rapidly produced by archaea in frequently oxygenated sandy sediments. By combining biogeochemical, metagenomic, and culture-based experiments, we show this activity is driven by aerotolerant methylotrophic methanogens (Methanococcoides spp.) broadly distributed in surface layers of sandy sediments, providing evidence of a hidden process contributing to marine methane emissions. Moreover, we show that methane emissions are driven by methylated seaweed and seagrass metabolites, revealing an unexpected feedback loop between eutrophication-driven algal blooms and greenhouse gas emissions."

Using recently resolved bat MHC-II structures, we analyzed AF-pred's prediction capability, logic, and limitation.

While the role of innate immunity in OA has been extensively studied, the involvement of adaptive immunity, in particular regulatory T cells (Tregs), is not well understood. Using a comprehensive multi-omic approach on the peripheral blood from 46 knee OA patients with similar radiographic stage, including deep immunophenotyping, cytokine profiling, transcriptomic and T-cell receptor analysis on sorted CD4 Tregs and effector T cells (Teffs), we identified an immunological signature associated with OA-related pain. Cytokines promoting Treg expansion and activation (with increases of sIL2-RA, sTNFR1, sTNFR2) were correlated with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscore, suggesting a potential Treg dysfunction. Nineteen T cell subsets were correlated with WOMAC pain. Notably, we found a negative correlation of cell subsets associated with Treg expansion and activation (FoxP3+CTLA4+, CD4+CD57+, Treg CD95+, CD4 Treg CD45RA-). Differential gene expression analysis between patients with low and high WOMAC pain intensity (threshold of 40/100) revealed an upregulation of inflammasome-related genes such as IL1RL1, IL31RA, IFITM3, NLRP3, IFNG in Tregs. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted an overrepresentation of innate immune response, IL-8, and interferon activation pathways suggesting a pro-inflammatory state in Tregs of patients with high pain intensity. Collectively, our systems immunology approach highlights multiple associations between Treg dysfunctionality and OA-related pain, providing new insights into the adaptive immune system's contribution to OA-related pain."

We have taken a pragmatic approach to improving expression and stability of neuraminidase by grafting antigenic surface loops from low-expressing neuraminidase proteins onto high-expressing strains. We generated hybrid proteins bearing the antigenic properties of the loop donor accompanied by the favourable expression, stability, and tetrameric structure of the loop recipient. The hybrid neuraminidase proteins were recognised by a broad set of human monoclonal antibodies induced by influenza infection or vaccination, and grafted loops were superposable in their X-ray structures. Immunisation of mice with neuraminidase hybrids induced inhibitory antibodies to the loop donor and protected against lethal influenza challenge. This pragmatic technique enables improved expression of influenza neuraminidase proteins for vaccine manufacture."

Unfortunately, we lack the subunit composition for all human protein complexes. To address this gap we integrated >25,000 mass spectrometry experiments using a machine learning approach to identify > 15,000 human protein complexes. We show our map of protein complexes is highly accurate and more comprehensive than previous maps, placing ~75% of human proteins into their physical contexts. We globally characterize our complexes using protein co-variation data (ProteomeHD.2) and identify co-varying complexes suggesting common functional associations. Our map also generates testable functional hypotheses for 472 uncharacterized proteins which we support using AlphaFold modeling. Additionally, we use AlphaFold modeling to identify 511 mutually exclusive protein pairs in hu.MAP3.0 complexes suggesting complexes serve different functional roles depending on their subunit composition. We identify expression as the primary way cells and organisms relieve the conflict of mutually exclusive subunits. Finally, we import our complexes to EMBL-EBI's Complex Portal (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal/home) as well as provide complexes through our hu.MAP3.0 web interface (https://humap3.proteincomplexes.org/).

Immunology,Single-Cell Antigen Receptor Sequencing in Pigs with Influenza,"Weihong,Darling Melany de Carvahlo,Sadie,Laurie,Nathan,Grant,Mingyi,Kiho,John P,Weihong,Darling Melany de Carvahlo,Sadie,Laurie,Nathan,Grant,Mingyi,Kiho,John P,Weihong,Darling Melany de Carvahlo,Sadie,Laurie,Nathan,Grant,Mingyi,Kiho","Understanding the pulmonary adaptive immune system of pigs is important as respiratory pathogens present a major challenge for swine producers and pigs are increasingly used to model human pulmonary diseases. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has accelerated the characterization of cellular phenotypes in the pig respiratory tract under both healthy and diseased conditions. However, combining scRNAseq with recovery of paired T cell receptor (TCR) α and β chains as well as B cell receptor (BCR) heavy and light chains to interrogate their repertoires has not to our knowledge been demonstrated for pigs. Here, we developed primers to enrich porcine TCR α and β chains along with BCR κ and β light chains and IgM, IgA, and IgG heavy chains that are compatible with the 10x Genomics VDJ sequencing protocol. Using these pig-specific assays, we sequenced the T and B cell receptors of cryopreserved lung cells from CD1D-expressing and -deficient pigs after one or two infections with influenza A virus (IAV) to examine whether natural killer T (NKT) cells alter pulmonary TCR and BCR repertoire selection. We also performed paired single-cell RNA and receptor sequencing of FACS-sorted T cells longitudinally sampled from the lungs of IAV-vaccinated and -infected pigs to track clonal expansion in response to IAV exposure. All pigs presented highly diverse repertoires. Pigs re-exposed to influenza antigens from either vaccination or infection exhibited higher numbers of expanded CD4 and CD8 T cell clonotypes with activated phenotypes, suggesting potential IAV reactive T cell populations. Our results demonstrate the utility of high throughput single-cell TCR and BCR sequencing in pigs."
Immunology,nsGSLs on tumors impair anti-tumor immune responses by OT-I T cells in vitro and support tumor growth in vivo,"Tamara,Aimee A.F.,Nordin D.,Tao,Manfred,Robbert M.,S. Marieke,Tamara,Aimee A.F.,Nordin D.,Tao,Manfred,Robbert M.,S. Marieke,Tamara,Aimee A.F.,Nordin D.,Tao,Manfred,Robbert M.","Tumors often evolve to engage numerous strategies to circumvent detection by the immune system. Our group recently discovered elevated neolacto-series glycosphingolipids (nsGSL) surface levels as a possible immune evasion mechanism of tumors. We demonstrated a direct disruption of both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity in vitro when expression of nsGSLs was upregulated on established target cells. It remains unclear however, whether in vivo nsGSLs play an active role in tumor development and can aid tumors in evading immune responses. To investigate whether nsGSLs facilitate tumor progression in vivo, we first established a murine model system using MC38-OVA cell lines with varying cell surface levels of nsGSLs. In vitro analysis revealed reduced MHC-I accessibility on tumor cells with elevated nsGSLs profiles, leading to diminished activation of OVA-specific OT-I T cells as evidenced by decreased expression of CD25, CD69, and production of IFNg, which subsequently resulted in decreased tumor cell death. Subsequent in vivo experiments investigating tumor outgrowth after engraftment of subcutaneously injected MC38-OVA cell lines with low or high cell surface levels of nsGSLs demonstrated better growth of nsGSL-rich tumor cells compared to nsGSL-poor tumors which could be controlled. Together these results suggest that nsGSLs expressed by tumors can facilitate immune evasion and subsequent tumor progression. These data pave the way to explore whether targeting of the GSL pathway with specific inhibitors could be advantageous as a therapy against tumors with high nsGSL levels."
Microbiology,Optimization of citric acid production from sugarcane molasses using Aspergillus niger by submerged Fermentation,"Al,Razu,Tajreen Naziba,Mohammad,Mohammed,Al,Razu,Tajreen Naziba,Mohammad,Mohammed,Al,Razu,Tajreen Naziba,Mohammad","The potentiality of citric acid on economy is high because of its multi-purpose uses, particularly in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Bangladesh spent more than million US dollars to import citric acid mostly from India and China. Its consumption is increasing 3.5 to 4%, annually, indicating the need for better manufacturing alternatives. Globally, citric acid is primarily produced through microbial fermentation with Aspergillus niger. To support the massive scale of production of citrate, the manufacturing process must be eco-friendly which should be inexpensive and available raw materials for maintaining high yielding in a cost-effective manner. In Bangladesh prospective, the current study has undertaken to optimize citric acid production using one of the most abundant raw materials sugarcane molasses. Moreover, the aim of this study was to determine the optimum conditions to produce citric acid from sugarcane molasses using Aspergillus niger (F81) by submerged fermentation. The amount of citric acid production was determined by Marier Boulet colorimetric method. The optimization data suggested that 10% substrate (from processed cane molasses), 4% inoculum size of A. niger, and initial pH 6.0 allowed to produce around 25.8 g/L citric acid. Further study is warranted to assess the feasibility of citrate production in an industrial level as well as improvement of microbial strains is needed to further enhance citric acid production."
Microbiology,RIG-I and MDA5 cooperatively recognize the DENV replicative-form dsRNA to activate innate immunity,"Sichao,Yisha,Yu,Bailiang,Jin,Sichao,Yisha,Yu,Bailiang,Jin,Sichao,Yisha,Yu,Bailiang","RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) are a family of cytosolic RNA sensors that sense RNA virus infection to activate innate immune response. It is generally believed that different RNA viruses are recognized by either RIG-I or MDA5, two important RLR members, depending on the nature of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are generated during RNA virus infection. However, it remains elusive which RLR is involved in sensing the PAMPs of Dengue virus (DENV), an important RNA virus causing serious human diseases, and the molecular basis of the DENV PAMPs is poorly defined. Here, we demonstrated that the DENV infection-induced interferon response is dependent upon both RIG-I and MDA5, with RIG-I playing a predominant role. Next we purified the DENV PAMPs from the DENV-infected cells by biochemical approaches and demonstrated that the purified DENV PAMPs are viral full-length double-stranded RNA bearing 5’ppp modifications, likely representing the viral replicative-form RNA. Finally, we confirmed the nature of the DENV PAMPs by reconstituting the viral replicative-form RNA from in vitro synthesized DENV genomic RNA. In conclusion, our work defined the molecular basis of the RLR-PAMP interactions during DENV infection, and revealed the previously neglected cooperative contributions by different RLRs in innate immunity against RNA viruses."
Microbiology,Activated carbon ameliorates type 2 diabetes via metabolic remodeling of the gut microbiota,"Cai-Xia,Yutong,Xiaoyu,Yin,Jian-Qiang,Cai-Xia,Yutong,Xiaoyu,Yin,Jian-Qiang,Cai-Xia,Yutong,Xiaoyu,Yin","Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major public health concern worldwide and there has been increasing attention on the role of natural dietary drugs in diabetes therapy. However, the effects of these drugs on gut microbial composition, functional potentials and metabolisms remain unclear. Here, we conducted integrated 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomic analyses in T2D GK rats and healthy Wistar rats that exposed to four natural dietary drugs (highly porous activated carbon, wheatgrass, dandelion and corn stigma). Oral administration of activated carbon and dandelion decreased the body weight gain in both high-fat diet (HFD) GK rats and Wistar rats. Significantly lower level of blood glucose was observed in GK rats with activated carbon intervention. A group of beneficial bacteria and metabolites were promoted, and the endotoxin-producing bacteria were inhibited by dietary drugs, especially for the activated carbon diet. Oral administration of activated carbon resulted in metabolic changes and anti-inflammatory effects that decreased both high-fat diet-induced obesity and diabetes. The beneficial effects of increased positive responders are related to improved carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, regulated inflammatory mediators, with simultaneous reduction of detrimental compounds such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis and modification of the gut microbiome. These findings highlight the effectiveness of natural dietary drugs, with a particular emphasis on activated carbon, and establish a foundation for tailoring the use of these drugs in T2D therapy."

Despite extensive research, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 replication remain unclear. To address this, we developed a single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) assay to directly visualize and analyse in vitro RNA synthesis by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We purified the minimal replication complex, comprising nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8, and combined it with fluorescently labelled RNA substrates, enabling real-time monitoring of RNA primer elongation at the single-molecule level. This platform allowed us to investigate the mechanisms of action of key inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication. In particular, our data provides evidence for remdesivir's mechanism of action, which involves polymerase stalling and subsequent chain termination dependent on the concentration of competing nucleotide triphosphates. Our study demonstrates the power of smFRET to provide dynamic insights into SARS-CoV-2 replication, offering a valuable tool for antiviral screening and mechanistic studies of viral RdRp activity."

In addition to their lack of alloreactivity, γδ T cells exhibit properties distinct from other lymphocyte subsets, prompting significant interest in their development as an off-the-shelf cellular immunotherapeutic. However, their low abundance in circulation, heterogeneity, limited methods for ex vivo expansion, and under-developed methodologies for genetic modification have hindered basic study and clinical application of γδ T cells. Here, we implement a feeder-free, scalable approach for ex vivo manufacture of polyclonal, non-virally modified, gene edited chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-γδ T cells in support of therapeutic application. Engineered CAR-γδ T cells demonstrate high function in vitro and and in vivo. Longitudinal in vivo pharmacokinetic profiling of adoptively transferred polyclonal CAR-γδ T cells uncover subset-specific responses to IL-15 cytokine armoring and multiplex base editing. Our results present a robust platform for genetic modification of polyclonal CAR-γδ T cells and present unique opportunities to further define synergy and the contribution of discrete, engineered CAR-γδ T cell subsets to therapeutic efficacy in vivo."

Joakim,Anna","The dissemination of mobile antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) via horizontal gene transfer is a significant threat to public health globally. The flow of ARGs into and between pathogens, however, remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to develop strategies for managing the antibiotic resistance crisis. Therefore, we aimed to identify genetic and ecological factors that are fundamental for successful horizontal ARG transfer. From the analysis of ~1 million bacterial genomes and >20,000 metagenomes, we developed random forest models that could reliably predict horizontal ARG transfer between bacteria. Our results suggest that genetic incompatibility, measured as nucleotide composition dissimilarity, negatively influences the likelihood of transfer of ARGs between evolutionarily divergent bacteria. Conversely, environmental co-occurrence increased the likelihood, especially in humans and wastewater, in which several environment-specific dissemination patterns were observed. This study provides new ways to predict the spread of ARGs and provides new insights into the mechanisms governing this evolutionary process."

The composition of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa RNA degradosome is largely unknown, and its RNase E CTD shows limited similarity to those in models like Escherichia coli or Caulobacter crescentus. Our study characterizes the function of conserved SLiMs in P. aeruginosa RNase E, including a duplicated sequence termed the ""REER-repeats"" region. This region, along with AR1 and AR4 SLiMs, mediates RNA binding and localizes the degradosome in subcellular foci. Pull-down and bacterial two-hybrid assays identified PNPase and RhlB as interacting proteins, with direct interactions confirmed via protein binding assays. The NDPR and AR1 SLiMs mediate these interactions, respectively. Transcriptome analyses and phenotypic assays of RNase E CTD mutants revealed growth defects in specific conditions and virulence defects, revealing the importance of RNase E CTD RNA binding and RNA degradosome scaffolding for P. aeruginosa adaptability."
Microbiology,An Update on Active and Passive Surveillance for African Swine Fever in the Dominican Republic,"Rachel A,Nianet,Silvia,Andres,Rachel A,Nianet,Silvia,Andres,Rachel A,Nianet,Silvia","African Swine Fever (ASF) is a viral, hemorrhagic disease of swine that is reportable to the World Organisation for Animal Health. Since 2007, ASF has been expanding globally and caused severe disruption to the global swine industry. In 2021, ASF was detected in the Dominican Republic, prompting an emergency response from local and international officials. Nearly three years later, ASF is still present in the country despite control efforts. This study used data from January 2023-March 2024 from government-mandated sampling of commercial farms, a newly initiated active surveillance program of backyard farms, and passive reports to provide a comprehensive and descriptive assessment of ASF in the Dominican Republic. The attack rate for each region was calculated, and the reproductive ratio (R0) was estimated using the doubling time method. ASF continues to be distributed throughout the Dominican Republic with lower attack rates in central regions and R0 nearing 1. These results suggest that ASF in the country is reaching a stable state that does not resemble an epidemic situation. This may suggest the need to change from an approach of emergency response to one of sustained and progressive control, ultimately for the long-term goal of ASF eradication in the Dominican Republic."

This SLC-centric knowledge is made accessible to the scientific community via a web portal, featuring interactive dashboards and a tool for family-wide, tree-based visualization of SLC properties. Making use of the systematically collected and curated data sets, we selected eight feature-dimensions to compute an integrated functional landscape of human SLCs. This landscape represents various functional aspects, harmonizing local and global features of the underlying data sets, as demonstrated by inspecting structural folds and subcellular locations of selected transporters. Based on all available data sets and their integration, we assigned a biochemical/biological function to each SLC, making it one of the largest systematic annotations of human gene function and likely acting as a blueprint for future endeavours."

We recorded 9,419 meals consumed by 173 patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation and profiled the microbiome in 1,009 longitudinally collected stool samples from 158 of them. Caloric intake was correlated with fecal microbiota diversity. Bayesian inference revealed associations between intake of sweets or sugars during antibiotic exposure with microbiome disruption, as assessed by low diversity or expansion of the pathobiont Enterococcus. We validated this observation experimentally, finding that sucrose exacerbated antibiotic-induced Enterococcus expansion in mice. Taken together, our results suggest that avoiding sugar-rich foods during antibiotic treatment may reduce microbiome injury."
Immunology,The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)-Immune Network in People Living With HIV,"Bridget R,Mitali,Maya,Niyati,Gabriela,Gina,Kaitlyn,Jinging,Zhihong,Mary Catherine,Jessica,Bridget R,Mitali,Maya,Niyati,Gabriela,Gina,Kaitlyn,Jinging,Zhihong,Mary Catherine,Jessica,Bridget R,Mitali,Maya,Niyati,Gabriela,Gina,Kaitlyn,Jinging,Zhihong,Mary Catherine","Background and Objectives: Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated direct influences of the sympathetic and vagal/parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) on the immune system. The relevance of these pathways to the development of inflammatory disorders in humans remains unknown.  We hypothesized that a comprehensive examination of the ANS-immune network in patients with HIV, would reveal that the type and severity of autonomic neuropathy (AN) would predict immune phenotypes with distinct clinical and demographic characteristics.    
Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of 79 adult people with a history of well-controlled HIV on stable combination antiretroviral treatment (CART) recruited from a primary care clinic network within the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. All participants underwent a standardized battery of autonomic function tests summarized as the Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS) and vagal and adrenergic baroreflex sensitivity (BRS-V and BRS-A). Immune profiling included: 1) measurement of interleukin-6 (IL-6) as part of the Olink assay Target 96 Inflammation Panel, 2) non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering analyses on Olink immune biomarkers, and 3) mass cytometry (CyTOF) on a subset of participants with and without autonomic neuropathy (N = 10).  
Results: Reduced activity of caudal vagal circuitry involved in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) predicted higher levels of IL-6 (Spearman's rho = -0.352, p=0.002). The comprehensive assessment of the ANS-immune network showed four immunotypes defined by NMF analyses. A pro-inflammatory immunotype defined by elevations in type 1 cytokines (IL-6, IL-17) and increased numbers of CD8+ T-cells was associated with autonomic neuropathy (AN). This association was driven by deficits in the cardiovascular sympathetic nervous system and remained strongly significant after controlling for the older age and greater burden of co-morbid illness among participants with this immunotype (aOR=4.7, p=0.017).  
Discussion:  Our results provide novel support for the clinical relevance of the CAP in patients with chronic inflammatory AN. These data also provide insight regarding the role of the sympathetic nervous system and aging in the progression and development of co-morbidities in patients with chronic HIV and support future research aimed at developing therapies focused on modulation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic/vagal nervous system."

Current autofocusing solutions are limited to focusing precision and range, thus impeding their application in high-accuracy research. Here, we introduce LUNA (locking under nanoscale accuracy), an innovative autofocusing method that leverages the coma pattern of detection light to characterize focus drift. LUNA improves the focusing precision down to 3 nm and extends the focusing range to at least 40 times the objective depth-of-focus. These advancements enable us to investigate how bacteria adapt to temperature change at the single-cell level, revealing a series of novel insights into bacterial cold shock response mechanisms. This approach addresses the complexities of growth dynamics, growth mode transition, division synchronization, and size regulation during the adaptation period, which present significant challenges for traditional analytical methods. Notably, the controversies between the growth lag of batch culture and continuous growth at the single-cell level are successfully explained based on scattering theory. LUNA shows enhanced performance in improving existing advanced microscopy technologies and demonstrates excellent potential for expanding state-of-the-art research in biology."

Yet, there remains a need to develop methods to understand the interaction of microbiome factors with host cells and to characterize their potential therapeutic functions. To address this challenge, we developed a systems biology framework we term the Pharmacobiome for microbiome pharmacology analysis. The Pharmacobiome framework evaluates similarities between microbes and microbial byproducts and known drugs based on their impact on host transcriptomic cellular signatures. Here, we apply our framework to characterization of the Anti-Gynecologic Cancer Vaginal Pharmacobiome. Using published vaginal microbiome multi-omics data from the Partners PrEP clinical trial, we constructed vaginal epithelial gene signatures associated with each profiled vaginal microbe and metabolite. We compared these microbiome-associated host gene signatures to post-drug perturbation host gene signatures associated with 35 FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures database to identify vaginal microbes and metabolites with high statistical and functional similarity to these drugs. We found that Lactobacilli and their metabolites can regulate host gene expression in ways similar to many anti-cancer drugs. Additionally, we experimentally tested our model prediction that taurine, a metabolite produced by L. crispatus, kills cancerous breast and endometrial cancer cells. Our study shows that the Pharmacobiome is a powerful framework for characterizing the anti-cancer therapeutic potential of vaginal microbiome factors with generalizability to other cancers, microbiomes, and diseases."

Here, we longitudinally tracked B cells recognizing WT spike in two individuals of mRNA vaccine, from convalescence of breakthrough infection to acute phase of reinfection. Comprehensive characterization of 632 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from those B cells reveals that mAbs cloned after reinfection have dramatically enhanced neutralizing breadth and potency, including 11 mAbs that potently neutralize all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants from WT to KP.3. Among the 11 mAbs, 5 mAbs are classified into public clonotypes encoded by IGHV3-53 or IGHV3-66, whereas the rest belong to a rarely reported clonotype encoded by IGHV3-74. Notably, IGHV3-74 mAbs can neutralize SARS-CoV-1 with a minimum IC50 of 0.055 μg/ml. Structural and functional analysis further suggests that IGHV3-74 mAbs target a novel epitope on receptor-binding domain and the best mAb, termed KXD352, is highly resilient to variations on this epitope. Overall, this study demonstrates that both public and rare antibody clonotypes primed by prototype mRNA vaccine can achieve extraordinary neutralizing breadth and potency in repeated Omicron infections."
Microbiology,Cyclic di-AMP drives developmental cycle progression in Chlamydia trachomatis,"Junghoon,Scot P,Junghoon,Scot P,Junghoon","The obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia alternates between two functional forms during its developmental cycle: elementary body (EB) and reticulate body (RB). However, the molecular mechanisms governing the transitions between these forms are unknown. Here, we present evidence cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) is a key factor in triggering the transition from RB to EB (i.e., secondary differentiation) in the chlamydial developmental cycle. By overexpressing or knocking down expression of c-di-AMP synthase genes, we made strains producing different levels of c-di-AMP, which we linked to changes in secondary differentiation status. Increases in c-di-AMP resulted in an earlier increase in transcription of EB-associated genes, and this was further manifested in earlier production of EBs. In contrast, when c-di-AMP levels were decreased, secondary differentiation was delayed. Based on these data, we conclude there is a threshold level of c-di-AMP needed to trigger secondary differentiation in Chlamydia. This is the first study to identify a mechanism by which secondary differentiation is initiated in Chlamydia and reveals a critical role for the second messenger signaling molecule c-di-AMP in this process."

Barton,David L.,Eunice,Jane H.,William H.,V. Michael,Kevin D.,Gary S.,Wei,E. Barton,David L.,Eunice,Jane H.,William H.,V. Michael,Kevin D.,Gary S.,Wei,E. Barton,David L.,Eunice,Jane H.,William H.,V. Michael,Kevin D.,Gary S.","Objective
The presence of autoantibodies to citrullinated protein antigens (ACPAs) in the absence of clinically-apparent inflammatory arthritis (IA) identifies individuals at-risk for developing future clinical rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, it is unclear why some ACPA+ individuals convert to clinical RA while others do not. We explored the possibility in the Targeting Immune Responses for Prevention of Rheumatoid Arthritis (TIP-RA) study that epigenetic remodeling is part of the trajectory from an at-risk state to clinical disease and identifies novel biomarkers associated with conversion to clinical RA.
Methods
ACPA- Controls, ACPA+ At-Risk, and Early RA individuals were followed for up to 5 years, including obtaining blood samples annually and at RA diagnosis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated into CD19+ B cells, memory CD4+ T cells, and naive CD4+ T cells using antibodies and magnetic beads. Genome-wide methylation within each cell lineage was assayed using the Illumina MethylationEPIC v1.0 beadchip. ACPA+ At-Risk participants who did or did not develop RA were designated Pre-RA or Non-converters, respectively. Differentially methylated loci (DML) were selected using the Limma software package. Using the Caret package, we constructed machine learning models in test and validation cohorts and identified the most predictive loci of clinical RA conversion.
Results
Cross-sectional differential methylation analysis at baseline revealed DMLs that distinguish the Pre-RA methylome from ACPA+ Non-converters, the latter which closely resembled ACPA- Controls. Genes overlapping these DMLs correspond to aberrant NOTCH signaling and DNA repair pathways in B cells. Longitudinal analysis showed that ACPA- Control and ACPA+ Non-converter methylomes are relatively constant. In contrast, the Pre-RA methylome remodeled along a dynamic RA methylome trajectory characterized by epigenetic changes in active regulatory elements. Clinical conversion to RA, defined based on diagnosis, marked an epigenetic inflection point for cell cycle pathways in B cells and adaptive immunity pathways in naive T cells. Machine learning revealed individual loci associated with RA conversion. This model significantly outperformed autoantibodies plus acute phase reactants as predictors of RA conversion.
Conclusion
DNA methylation is a dynamic process in ACPA+ individuals at-risk for developing RA that eventually transition to clinical disease. In contrast, non-converters and controls have stable methylomes. The accumulation of epigenetic marks over time prior to conversion to clinical RA conforms to pathways that are associated with immunity and can be used to identify potential pathogenic pathways for therapeutic targeting and/or use as prognostic biomarkers."

Here, we report the discovery of frequent genetic alterations in the desmosome in human cancers, with the strongest signal seen in cutaneous melanoma where desmosomes are mutated in >70% of cases. In primary but not metastatic melanoma biopsies, the burden of coding mutations in desmosome genes associates with a strong reduction in desmosome gene expression. Analysis by spatial transcriptomics and protein immunofluorescence suggests that these expression decreases occur in keratinocytes in the microenvironment rather than in primary melanoma cells. In further support of a microenvironmental origin, we find that desmosome gene knockdown in keratinocytes yields markedly increased proliferation of adjacent melanoma cells in keratinocyte/melanoma co-cultures. Similar increases in melanoma proliferation are observed in media preconditioned by desmosome-deficient keratinocytes. Thus, gradual accumulation of desmosome mutations in neighboring cells may prime melanoma cells for neoplastic transformation."
Systems Biology,Metabolic interplay drives population cycles in a cross-feeding microbial community,"Tyler,Christopher A,Ophelia,Tyler,Christopher A,Ophelia,Tyler,Christopher A","Population cycles are prevalent in ecosystems and play key roles in determining their functions. While multiple mechanisms have been theoretically shown to generate population cycles, there are limited examples of mutualisms driving self-sustained oscillations. Using an engineered microbial community that cross-feeds essential amino acids, we experimentally demonstrate cycles in strain abundance that are robust across environmental conditions. A nonlinear dynamical model that incorporates the experimentally observed cross-inhibition of amino acid production recapitulates the population cycles. The model shows that the cycles represent internally generated relaxation oscillations, which emerge when fast resource dynamics with positive feedback drive slow changes in strain abundance. Our findings highlight the critical role of resource dynamics and feedback in shaping population cycles in microbial communities and have implications for biotechnology."
Microbiology,A dissection of the genomic antimicrobial resistance epidemiology of Salmonella Typhimurium,"Sandeep,Michael,Sally R.,Vitali,Ruiting,Sandeep,Michael,Sally R.,Vitali,Ruiting,Sandeep,Michael,Sally R.,Vitali","Salmonella Typhimurium (STm) is a globally prevalent pathogen. We compiled a dataset comprising ~65,000 publicly available STm isolates and analysed the predicted-resistance to 15 key antibiotics. Additionally, we typed all isolates using a standardized typing method, multilevel genome typing (MGT), and characterised the resistance profiles by MGT sequence types (ST). We identified 407 MGT STs wherein at least 80% of the isolates were non-susceptible to at least one antibiotic. For the key antibiotics prescribed for severe salmonellosis, we identified three ciprofloxacin non-susceptible MGT STs, and eight cefotaxime non-susceptible MGT STs in the last two years of the dataset (2021-2022). While the ciprofloxacin non-susceptible MGT STs comprised isolates predominantly from the UK; only one cefotaxime non-susceptible MGT ST comprised isolates predominantly from UK and associated with swine, with others from USA, and associated with cattle and poultry. Integration of AMR predictions with MGT strain typing provides sharable, standardised, and specific identification and tracking of resistant isolates. This integrated analysis presents a unique approach for the global surveillance of antimicrobial resistance and resistant strains."
Systems Biology,Energy-based Modelling of Single Actin Filament Polymerisation Using Bond Graphs,"Peter,Michael,Vijay,Peter,Michael,Vijay,Peter,Michael","Bond graphs provide an energy-based methodology for modelling complex systems in a hierarchical fashion; at the moment, the method allows biological system with both chemical and electrical subsystems to be modelled. Herein, the bond graph approach is extended to include chemomechanical transduction thus extending the range of biological systems to be modelled.
Actin filament polymerisation and force generation is used as an example of chemomechanical transduction and it is shown that the TF (transformer) bond graph component provides a practical, and conceptually simple, alternative to the Brownian ratchet approach of Peskin, Odell, Oster & Mogilner. Furthermore it is shown that the bond graph approach leads to the same equation as the Brownian ratchet approach in the simplest case.
The approach is illustrated by showing that flexibility and non-normal incidence can be modelled by simply adding additional bond graph components and that compliance leads to non-convexity of the force-velocity curve.
Energy flows are fundamental to life; for this reason, the energy based approach is utilised to investigate the power transmission by the actin filament and its corresponding efficiency.
The bond graph model is fitted to experimental data by adjusting model physical parameters."
Microbiology,Altering the redox status of Chlamydia trachomatis directly impacts its developmental cycle progression,"Vandana,Scot P,Vandana,Scot P,Vandana","Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen with a unique developmental cycle. It differentiates between two functional and morphological forms: elementary body (EB) and reticulate body (RB). The signals that trigger differentiation from one form to the other are unknown. EBs and RBs have distinctive characteristics that distinguish them, including their size, infectivity, proteome, and transcriptome. Intriguingly, they also differ in their overall redox status as EBs are oxidized and RBs are reduced. We hypothesize that alterations in redox may serve as a trigger for secondary differentiation. To test this, we examined the function of the primary antioxidant enzyme alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (AhpC), a well-known member of the peroxiredoxins family, in chlamydial growth and development. Based on our hypothesis, we predicted that altering the expression of ahpC would modulate chlamydial redox status and trigger earlier or delayed secondary differentiation. To test this, we created ahpC overexpression and knockdown strains. During ahpC knockdown, ROS levels were elevated, and the bacteria were sensitive to a broad set of peroxide stresses. Interestingly, we observed increased expression of EB-associated genes and concurrent higher production of EBs at an earlier time in the developmental cycle, indicating earlier secondary differentiation occurs under elevated oxidation conditions. In contrast, overexpression of AhpC created a resistant phenotype against oxidizing agents and delayed secondary differentiation. Together, these results indicate that redox potential is a critical factor in developmental cycle progression. For the first time, our study provides a mechanism of chlamydial secondary differentiation dependent on redox status."

Here, a multi-omics approach was applied to profile the immune response of 30 wP and 31 aP-primed individuals and identify correlates of T cell polarization before and after Tdap booster vaccination. We found that transcriptional changes indicating an interferon response on day 1 post-booster along with elevated plasma concentrations of IFN-γ and interferon-induced chemokines that peaked at day 1-3 post-booster correlated best with the Th1 polarization of the vaccine-induced memory T cell response on day 28. Our studies suggest that wP-primed individuals maintain their Th1 polarization through this early memory interferon response. This suggests that stimulating the interferon pathway during vaccination could be an effective strategy to elicit a predominant Th1 response in aP-primed individuals that protects better against infection."
Evolutionary Biology,Transcriptomic bases of within- and trans-generational predator-induced plasticity in the freshwater snail Physa acuta,"Leo,Nathanelle,Juliette,Maxime,Tristan,Lara,Sandrine,Emilien,Leo,Nathanelle,Juliette,Maxime,Tristan,Lara,Sandrine,Emilien,Leo,Nathanelle,Juliette,Maxime,Tristan,Lara,Sandrine","Inducible defences in response to predation risk are a well-known example of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. While inducible defences have been mainly studied within a generation (within-generational plasticity), there is now clear evidence that the ancestral exposure to predation risk can influence the defences expressed by the offspring, even if they have not been exposed themselves (transgenerational plasticity). The molecular mechanisms allowing the transmission of environmental information across generations are still misunderstood. In this study, we combined measures of anti-predator responses (behavioural and morphological) with transcriptomic investigations across two generations in the freshwater snail Physa acuta. We hypothesised that both within- and transgenerational plasticity would induce phenotypic changes associated with differential gene expression. Our results confirmed within- and transgenerational plasticity: F1 snails have responded to predator-cue exposure by increasing escape behaviour, reducing shell length, and developing thicker and slender shells and F2 from exposed parents have shown similar responses. Within- and transgenerational plasticity were accompanied by the differential expression of 78 genes (77 up- and 1 down-regulated) and 14 differentially expressed genes (13 up- and 1 down-regulated), respectively. Within- and transgenerational plasticity did not share common differentially expressed genes but some differentially expressed genes in F1 are also highly expressed in F2 and overall, the molecular functions were similar, involving metabolism and transcription regulation. The quantitatively low molecular response associated with transgenerational plasticity suggests that gene expression changes induced by parental exposure may have occurred early in development and have decreased at adult stage."

Evolutionary Biology,Bayesian Inference of Pathogen Phylogeography using the Structured Coalescent Model,"Ian,Richard G,Jere,Xavier,Ian,Richard G,Jere,Xavier,Ian,Richard G,Jere","Over the past decade, pathogen genome sequencing has become well established as a powerful approach to study infectious disease epidemiology. In particular, when multiple genomes are available from several geographical locations, comparing them is informative about the relative size of the local pathogen populations as well as past migration rates and events between locations. The structured coalescent model has a long history of being used as the underlying process for such phylogeographic analysis. However, the computational cost of using this model does not scale well to the large number of genomes frequently analysed in pathogen genomic epidemiology studies. Several approximations of the structured coalescent model have been proposed, but their effects are difficult to predict. Here we show how the exact structured coalescent model can be used to analyse a precomputed dated phylogeny, in order to perform Bayesian inference on the past migration history, the effective population sizes in each location, and the directed migration rates from any location to another. We describe an efficient reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme which is implemented in a new R package. We use simulations to demonstrate the scalability and correctness of our method and to compare it with existing comparable software. We also applied our new method to several state-of-the-art  datasets on the population structure of real pathogens to showcase the relevance of our method to current data scales and research questions."

B. bacteriovorus could be particularly potent as it kills a broad range of human bacterial pathogens, however, it remains unclear whether prey can evolve genetically-determined resistance against predation. Here, we show that the model bacterium Escherichia coli K-12 consistently evolves resistance against B. bacteriovorus during experimental evolution. Selection for resistance scaled positively with predation pressure and was widespread after two cycles of predator exposure. Like antibiotics, predation resistance was costly, manifesting in a trade-off between predation resistance and fitness in the absence of predators. Genetic analysis identified changes in outer membrane porin OmpF as common resistance mechanism, while a mutation in cell envelope lipopolysaccharide-modifying enzyme WaaF was rarer but also conferred predation resistance. Our study uncovers evolutionary and mechanistic aspects of prey escape from predation, generating important knowledge on predator-prey interactions and to advance sustainable treatments."
Evolutionary Biology,Heterozygote advantage can explain the extraordinary diversity of immune genes,"Mattias,Claus,Mattias,Claus,Mattias","The majority of highly polymorphic genes are related to immune functions and with over 100 alleles within a population, genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are the most polymorphic loci in vertebrates. How such extraordinary polymorphism arose and is maintained is controversial. One possibility is heterozygote advantage (HA), which can in principle maintain any number of alleles, but biologically explicit models based on this mechanism have so far failed to reliably predict the coexistence of significantly more than ten alleles. We here present an eco-evolutionary model showing that evolution can result in the emergence and maintenance of more than 100 alleles under HA if the following two assumptions are fulfilled: first, pathogens are lethal in the absence of an appropriate immune defence; second, the effect of pathogens depends on host condition, with hosts in poorer condition being affected more strongly. Thus, our results show that HA can be a more potent force in explaining the extraordinary polymorphism found at MHC loci than currently recognized."

Even though the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) provides recommendations for variant nomenclature,  discrepancies in annotation remain a significant hurdle. 
Methods: This study evaluated the annotation concordance between three tools-ANNOVAR, SnpEff, and Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)-using 164,549 two-star variants from ClinVar. The analysis used HGVS nomenclature string-match comparisons to assess annotation consistency from each tool, corresponding coding impacts, and associated ACMG criteria inferred from the annotations.
Results: The analysis revealed variable concordance rates, with 58.52% agreement for HGVSc, 84.04% for HGVSp, and 85.58% for the coding impact. SnpEff showed the highest match for HGVSc (0.988), while VEP bettered for HGVSp (0.977). The substantial discrepancies were noted in the Loss-of-Function (LoF) category. Incorrect PVS1 interpretations affected the final pathogenicity and downgraded PLP variants (ANNOVAR 55.9%, SnpEff 66.5%, VEP 67.3%), risking false negatives of clinically relevant variants in reports. 
Conclusions: These findings highlight the critical challenges in accurately interpreting variant pathogenicity due to discrepancies in annotations. To enhance the reliability of genetic variant interpretation in clinical practice, standardizing transcript sets and systematically cross-validating results across multiple annotation tools is essential."

However, the existing reference genome for pigs is incomplete, with thousands of segments and missing centromeres and telomeres, which limits our understanding of the important traits in these genomic regions. To address this issue, we present a near complete genome assembly for the Jinhua pig (JH-T2T), constructed using PacBio HiFi and ONT long reads. This assembly includes all 18 autosomes and the X and Y sex chromosomes, with only six gaps. It features annotations of 46.90% repetitive sequences, 35 telomeres, 17 centromeres, and 23,924 high-confident genes. Compared to the Sscrofa11.1, JH-T2T closes nearly all gaps, extends sequences by 177 Mb, predicts more intact telomeres and centromeres, and gains 799 more genes and loses 114 genes. Moreover, it enhances the mapping rate for both Western and Chinese local pigs, outperforming Sscrofa11.1 as a reference genome. Additionally, this comprehensive genome assembly will facilitate large-scale variant detection and enable the exploration of genes associated with pig domestication, such as GPAM, CYP2C18, LY9, ITLN2, and CHIA. Our findings represent a significant advancement in pig genomics, providing a robust resource that enhances genetic research, breeding programs, and biomedical applications."

We identified 82,174 ACRs and reported that 39.55% of them exhibited significant variation across the population. Next, we used the accessibility of ACRs as a quantitative feature and performed a chromatin associability GWAS (caGWAS), resulting in 27,004 caQTLs. Among them, 2,463 were predicted to disrupt the cis-regulatory elements that TF binds in these ACRs, suggesting that TF binding affects chromatin accessibility. Specifically, we identified two caACRs that regulate the expression of fad7, which encodes a fatty acid desaturase and affects the linolenic acid content.Our findings highlight the dynamic nature of maize ACRs and demonstrate that chromatin accessibility information could be used for GWASs, offering key insights into the genetic and regulatory mechanisms of chromatin accessibility and its impact on complex traits in plants."
Genomics,Xist RNA binds select autosomal genes and depends on Repeat B to regulate their expression,"Shengze,Yesu,Barry,Jeannie T,Shengze,Yesu,Barry,Jeannie T,Shengze,Yesu,Barry","Xist, a pivotal player in X chromosome inactivation (XCI), has long been perceived as a cis-acting long noncoding RNA that binds exclusively to the inactive X chromosome (Xi). However, Xists ability to diffuse under select circumstances has also been documented, leading us to suspect that Xist RNA may have targets and functions beyond the Xi. Here, using female mouse embryonic stem cells (ES) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) as models, we demonstrate that Xist RNA indeed can localize beyond the Xi. However, its binding is limited to approximately 100 genes in cells undergoing XCI (ES cells) and in post-XCI cells (MEFs). The target genes are diverse in function but are unified by their active chromatin status. Xist binds discretely to promoters of target genes in neighborhoods relatively depleted for Polycomb marks, contrasting with the broad, Polycomb-enriched domains reported for human XIST RNA. We find that Xist binding is associated with down-modulation of autosomal gene expression. However, unlike on the Xi, Xist binding does not lead to full silencing and also does not spread beyond the target gene. Over-expressing Xist in transgenic ES cells similarly leads to autosomal gene suppression, while deleting Xists Repeat B motif reduces autosomal binding and perturbs autosomal down-regulation. Furthermore, treating female ES cells with the Xist inhibitor, X1, leads to loss of autosomal suppression. Altogether, our findings reveal that Xist targets ~100 genes beyond the Xi, identify Repeat B as a crucial domain for its in-trans function in mice, and indicate that autosomal targeting can be disrupted by a small molecule inhibitor."
Genomics,Genotyping sequence-resolved copy-number variation using pangenomes reveals paralog-specific global diversity and expression divergence of duplicated genes,"Walfred,Mark,Walfred,Mark,Walfred","Copy-number variable (CNV) genes are important in evolution and disease, yet sequence variation in CNV genes are a blindspot for large-scale studies. We present a method, ctyper, that leverages pangenomes to produce copy-number maps with allele-specific sequences containing locally phased variants of CNV genes from NGS reads. We extensively characterized accuracy and efficiency on a database of 3,351 CNV genes including HLA, SMN, and CYP2D6 as well as 212 non-CNV medically-relevant challenging genes. The genotypes capture 96.5% of underlying variants in new genomes, requiring 0.9 seconds per gene. Expression analysis of ctyper genotypes explains more variance than known eQTL variants. Comparing allele-specific expression quantified divergent expression on 7.94% of paralogs and tissue-specific biases on 4.7% of paralogs. We found reduced expression of SMN-1 converted from SMN-2, which potentially affects diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy, and increased expression of a duplicative translocation of AMY2B. Overall, ctyper enables biobank-scale genotyping of CNV and challenging genes."
Genomics,A Reproducibility Focused Meta-Analysis Method for Single-Cell Transcriptomic Case-Control Studies Uncovers Robust Differentially Expressed Genes,"Nathan Joel,Drew,Longda,Austin,Evan,Eric,Rahul,Nathan Joel,Drew,Longda,Austin,Evan,Eric,Rahul,Nathan Joel,Drew,Longda,Austin,Evan,Eric","Here we systematically studied the reproducibility of DEGs in previously published Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and COVID-19 scRNA-seq studies. We found that while transcriptional scores created from differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in individual PD and COVID-19 datasets had moderate predictive power for the case control status of other datasets (mean AUC=0.77 and 0.75, respectively), genes from individual AD datasets had poor predictive power (mean AUC=0.68). We developed a non-parametric meta-analysis method, SumRank, based on reproducibility of relative differential expression ranks across datasets. The meta-analysis genes had improved predictive power (AUCs of 0.88, 0.91, and 0.78, respectively). By multiple other metrics, specificity and sensitivity of these genes were substantially higher than those discovered by dataset merging and inverse variance weighted p-value aggregation methods. The DEGs revealed known and novel biological pathways, and we validate the BCAT1 gene as down-regulated in oligodendrocytes in an AD mouse model. Our analyses show that for heterogeneous diseases, DEGs of individual studies often have low reproducibility, but combining information across multiple datasets promotes the rigorous discovery of reproducible DEGs."
Genetics,Limitations of ad hoc genotyping in detecting ash dieback tolerance in Fraxinus excelsior,"Aglaia,Gregor,Carlos,Thomas,Thomas,Silvio,Heino,Aglaia,Gregor,Carlos,Thomas,Thomas,Silvio,Heino,Aglaia,Gregor,Carlos,Thomas,Thomas,Silvio","Ash dieback (ADB), caused by the invasive alien fungal pathogen Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, is an emerging disease that poses major threats to the survival of common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) in Europe. Here, we report on a field trial aiming at the identification of ADB tolerant genotypes while encompassing the genetic diversity of common ash in Austria. Over 35,000 progenies from more than 600 putative tolerant mother trees were assessed for ADB symptoms over a period of three years. One tolerant and one susceptible progeny from a subset of the mother tree range (570 trees) were genotyped using the 4TREE array, a genotyping tool developed specifically to screen common ash provenances for their tolerance to ash dieback. We aimed to (1) better characterize the genetic structure of common ash in Austria, (2) identify hybrids between common ash and F. angustifolia (narrow-leaved ash), (3) detect genetic loci associated with tolerance to ADB, and (4) identify genetic variation associated with abiotic factors such as temperature and precipitation influencing the severity of ADB. We identify ash individuals from Eastern Austria matching putative hybrids with F. angustifolia showing varying degrees of F. angustifolia ancestry in structure analyses. The non-hybrid gene pool is characterized by shallow genetic structure following a west to east geographic pattern. In contrast to our expectations, genotype-damage association analyses overall fail to detect SNPs associated with tolerance to ADB. Our findings underscore that the polygenic architecture governing tolerance and the rapid decay of genomic linkage disequilibrium (LD) (within approximately 10 kb) significantly limit the ability to identify association outliers using the 4TREE SNP array. This highlights the constrained utility of chip genotyping approaches for this specific purpose. In contrast, the array proves successful in detecting hybrids between common ash and narrow-leaved ash, as well as outlier SNPs associated with abiotic predictors (such as annual precipitation and temperature) known to influence the severity of ADB damage."

Genetics,Balanced polymorphisms in gamete-binding genes are not associated with human infertility,"Michael William,Bernard,Ken,Michael William,Bernard,Ken,Michael William,Bernard","Genes expressed in gametes that mediate sperm interaction with the mammalian egg are of considerable interest to evolutionary biologists because the evolution of such genes can account for variation in reproductive compatibility between mates and reproductive isolation between species. The human orthologs of such genes are also potential targets for both contraception and treatment of infertility. One gene system of particular interest is the sperm-binding genes of the inner egg coat or zona pellucida (Zp2, Zp3) and their cognate protein in the mouse sperm acrosome (Zp3r). Previous population genetic analyses in humans pointed toward three balanced polymorphisms (one in each gene ZP2, ZP3, and ZP3R) as potential targets of some form of balancing selection in the evolution of human fertility. We tested that association using genetic analysis of couples seeking fertility assistance, but we could not reject the null hypothesis of no association between balanced polymorphisms and infertility. Our study was based on a small sample of couples, but the data were sound: the allele frequencies at those three balanced polymorphisms were not different from random expectation in that clinical sample. If an effect of those allele frequencies on infertility exists it is probably small. Our study was based in part on an old error in gene annotation that was only recently discovered (after the start of participant recruitment for this genetic analysis), and this error may account for our results, which argue against a role for balancing selection on those three genes in humans."
Genetics,Machine vision based frailty assessment for genetically diverse mice,"Gautam S,Gary A,Vivek,Gautam S,Gary A,Vivek,Gautam S,Gary A","Frailty indexes (FIs) capture health status in humans and model organisms. To accelerate our understanding of biological aging and carry out scalable interventional studies, high-throughput approaches are necessary. We previously introduced a machine vision-based visual frailty index (vFI) that uses mouse behavior in the open field to assess frailty using C57BL/6J (B6J) data. Aging trajectories are highly genetic and are frequently modeled in genetically diverse animals. In order to extend the vFI to genetically diverse mouse populations, we collect frailty and behavior data on a large cohort of aged Diversity Outbred (DO) mice. Combined with previous data, this represents one of the largest video-based aging behavior datasets to date. Using these data, we build accurate predictive models of frailty, chronological age, and even the proportion of life lived. The extension of automated and objective frailty assessment tools to genetically diverse mice will enable better modeling of aging mechanisms and enable high-throughput interventional aging studies."

MM has a strong inherited component, and while the mutational and transcriptomic landscapes of MM have been characterized extensively, the molecular consequences of germline genetic variation in MM have not been previously explored. Here, we have leveraged matched genotype and expression data from 607 patients to map the germline and somatic regulatory variation in MM. We find that non-coding variation shapes the transcriptional landscape of MM, contributing to overall survival. These regulatory variants alter the binding of transcription factors with known importance in MM, such as IRF4, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms. These data contribute to the increasing understanding of the genetic, molecular, and cellular forces shaping MM risk and outcomes."
Genomics,Early establishment and life course stability of sex biases in the human brain transcriptome,"Clara,Juho V.,Jaakko,Juha,Mark J.,Taru,Clara,Juho V.,Jaakko,Juha,Mark J.,Taru,Clara,Juho V.,Jaakko,Juha,Mark J.","To elaborate on the origins of the established male-female differences in several brain-related phenotypes, we assessed the patterns of transcriptomic sex biases in the developing and adult human forebrain. We find an abundance of sex differences in expression (sex-DE) in the prenatal brain, driven by both hormonal and sex-chromosomal factors, and considerable consistency in the sex effects between the developing and adult brain, with little sex-DE exclusive to the adult forebrain. Sex-DE was not enriched in genes associated with brain disorder, consistent with systematic differences in the characteristics of these genes (e.g. constraint). Yet, the genes with persistent sex-DE across lifespan were overrepresented in disease gene co-regulation networks, pointing to their potential to mediate sex biases in brain phenotypes. Altogether, our work highlights the prenatal development as a crucial timepoint for the establishment of brain sex differences."
Genomics,Identification of key genes and enriched biological processes in diabetes-associated traumatic brain injury through weighted gene correlation network and bioinformatics analysis,"Umar Faruk,Ibrahim,Umar Faruk,Ibrahim,Umar Faruk","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with long-term neurological and psychological impacts. Recent studies have indicated that diabetes (T1DM) exacerbates the outcomes of TBI, leading to more severe cognitive deficits and increased risk of complications. This study investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for T1DM-associated TBI. Four mRNA datasets (GSE4745, GSE125451, GSE173975, and GSE80174) downloaded from GEO repository were used in this study. Using limma, a total of 284 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in T1DM, of which 11 were upregulated and 9 were downregulated. GSEA showed that these DEGs were significantly enriched in cell communication, lipid metabolic process, and PPAR signaling. A total of 584 DEGs were identified in TBI, of which 186 were upregulated and 9 were downregulated. GSEA showed that these DEGs were mainly enriched in immune response-regulating signaling pathway. WGCNA identified 122 significant genes in TIDM-related modules and 368 significant genes in TBI-related module. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that T1DM module genes were significantly correlated with lipid metabolic process and ribosome biogenesis, while TBI module genes were significantly correlated with inflammation and immune response, including leukocyte mediated immunity, lymphocyte mediated immunity, and cytokine mediated receptor activity. PPI network analysis of T1DM module genes identified 20 hub genes, including 14 ribosomal genes: Rpl23, Rps3a, Rps6, Rpl5, Rpl17, Rps24, Rpl23a, Rps4x, Rpl9, Rps15a14, Rpl30, Rpl31, Rps25, and Rps27a-2. The hub genes were primarily related to ribosome biogenesis and RNA post-transcriptional regulation. PPI network analysis of TBI module genes identified 20 hub genes: Ptprc, Tp53, Stat1, Stat3, Tyrobp, Itgad, Csf1r, Itgb2, Rac2, Icam1, Myd88, Cd44, Vav1, Aif1, C1qa, Laptm5, B2m, Fcer1g, and Lyn. The hub genes were primarily related to inflammatory mediators and immune response. Based on the overlap of T1DM module genes and TBI module genes, Cmklr1, Mgst1, and Plin2, were identified as key genes of T1DM-associated TBI. Functional enrichment analysis showed that they were primarily enriched in the cellular response to hydroperoxide, cytokine-mediated receptor signaling activity, regulation of sequestering of triglyceride, negative regulation of IL-12 production, and positive regulation of macrophage chemotaxis. Using Reactome, Cmklr1, Mgst1, and Plin2 were related to cytokine signaling activity, neutrophil degranulation, and lipid storage, respectively. We concluded that Lipid droplet dysregulation and Neuroinflammation are the potential molecular mechanisms of T1DM-associated TBI. Cmklr1, Mgst1, and Plin2 are positively correlated with T1DM-associated TBI and may be important biomarkers and potential treatment targets for diabetic TBI."
Genetics,"Genomic prediction of heterosis, inbreeding control, and mate allocation in outbred diploid and tetraploid populations","Jeffrey B.,Jeffrey B.","Breeders have long appreciated the need to balance selection for short-term genetic gain with maintaining genetic variance for long-term gain. For outbred populations, the method called Optimum Contribution Selection (OCS) chooses parental contributions to maximize the average breeding value at a prescribed inbreeding rate. With Optimum Mate Allocation (OMA), the contribution of each mating is optimized, which allows for specific combining ability due to dominance. To enable OCS and OMA in polyploid species, new theoretical results were derived to (1) predict mid-parent heterosis due to dominance and (2) control inbreeding in a population of arbitrary ploidy. A new Convex optimization framework for OMA, named COMA, was developed and released as public software. Under stochastic simulation of a genomic selection program, COMA maintained a target inbreeding rate of 0.5% using either pedigree or genomic IBD kinship. Significantly more genetic gain was realized with pedigree kinship, which is consistent with previous studies showing the selective advantage of an individual under OCS is dominated by its Mendelian sampling term. Despite the higher accuracy (+0.2–0.3) when predicting mate performance with OMA compared to OCS, there was little long-term gain advantage. The sparsity of the COMA mating design and flexibility to incorporate mating constraints offer practical incentives over OCS. In a potato breeding case study with 170 candidates, the optimal solution at 0.5% inbreeding involved 43 parents but only 43 of the 903 possible matings."

Given the relatively small number of signaling pathways, the existence of multiple related ligands for many of these pathways is thought to represent a key evolutionary innovation for encoding complexity into cell-cell signaling. Relatedly, crosstalk and other interactions between pathways is another critical feature which allows a modest number pathways to ultimately generate an enormously diverse range of outcomes. It would thus be useful to have genetic tools to identify and manipulate not only those cells which express a given signaling ligand, but also those cells that specifically co-express pairs of signaling ligands. Here, we present a collection of split-Gal4 knock-in lines targeting many of the ligands for highly conserved signaling pathways in "
Genetics,Protein Kinases in Phagocytosis: Promising Genetic Biomarkers for Cancer,"Sadhika,Hengrui,Sadhika,Hengrui,Sadhika","Cancer is a complex disease characterized by genetic and molecular diversity, often involving dysregulation of critical cellular pathways. Recent advances in pan-cancer research have highlighted the importance of shared oncogenic mechanisms across different cancer types, providing new avenues for therapeutic exploration. Protein kinases, particularly those involved in phagocytosis, play pivotal roles in cellular homeostasis and immune response. This study systematically examines the genetic alterations and expression profiles of protein kinases associated with phagocytosis across various cancer types, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other publicly available resources. We analyzed single nucleotide variations (SNVs), copy number variations (CNVs), methylation patterns, and mRNA expression to identify recurring alterations and their associations with survival outcomes. Our findings reveal that MET and MERTK are the most frequently mutated genes, with missense mutations dominating across cancers. CNV analysis shows significant correlations with survival in cancers like UCEC, KIRP, and KIRC, while methylation analysis indicates cancer-specific regulatory patterns affecting gene expression. Differential expression analysis highlights distinct cancer-type-specific expression profiles, with genes like MET and BTK displaying significant variation. Crosstalk pathway analysis further reveals the involvement of these kinases in key cancer-related pathways, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and apoptosis. Drug sensitivity analysis identifies potential therapeutic targets, with gene expression correlating significantly with cancer cell line responsiveness to specific compounds. These findings underscore the importance of the phagocytotic kinome in cancer biology and suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting protein kinases to enhance immune response and improve treatment outcomes."

Here, the results from more than 23 laboratories are presented. The primary purpose was to design experiments simulating typical casework circumstances; collect data and to implement Bayesian networks to assess the value (i.e., likelihood ratio) of DNA results given activity level propositions. Two different experimental designs were used to simulate a robbery, where a screwdriver was used to force a door or window. Propositions and case information were chosen following laboratory feedback listing typical casework circumstances (included in the paper). Whereas the proposition representing prosecution’s view is applicable to many cases: the defendant forced the door/window with his screwdriver; the proposition representing defence’s view are more variable depending on what is alleged to have happened. In a direct transfer experiment, the defendant owned and used the screwdriver, but he did not force the door/window in question. An unknown person used the defendant’s stolen screwdriver. In an indirect transfer experiment, the defendant neither owned, saw, nor used the screwdriver, nor did they force the door or window. Instead, an unknown individual—someone with whom the defendant had interacted (e.g., by shaking hands or touching the same objects)—used the recovered tool to force entry. In the first experiment, if the defendant forced the door/window, then s/he is the last handler of the screw driver, whereas if the tool was stolen and used by an unknown person, the defendant is the first handler. For the second experiment, given the defence view, the defendant never held the screwdriver. We envisaged the situation where an object manipulated by the defendant (or the defendant himself/herself) would be touched by the unknown offender who would then force the window. The time delay between the touching of the object and the forcing of the window was 0, 1h, and 2h. This was accomplished by handshaking experiments, where the person forcing the door would shake a person’s hand, and then use the screwdriver either immediately after handshake or after 1, 2 hours. It was found for the direct transfer experiment that unless a single contributor profile aligning with the known person’s of interest profile was retrieved, the results did not allow to discriminate propositions. On the other hand, for the indirect transfer experiment, both single and major contributor profiles that aligned with the person of interest (POI) supported the proposition that the person used the tool rather than an unknown person who had touched an object, when indeed the former was true. There was considerable variation in median recoveries of DNA between laboratories (between 200pg - 5ng) for a given experiment if quantities are taken into account. These differences affect the likelihood ratios given activity level propositions. More than 2,700 samples were analysed in the course of this study. Two different Bayesian Networks are made available via an open source application written in Shiny R: Shiny_React(). For comparison, all datasets were analysed using a qualitative method categorised into absent, single, balanced or major given contributors."

To address this need, we compiled an aberrant expression prediction benchmark covering 8.2 million rare variants from 633 individuals across 49 tissues. While not geared toward aberrant expression, the deleteriousness score CADD and the loss-of-function predictor LOFTEE showed mild predictive ability (1-1.6% average precision). Leveraging these and further variant annotations, we next trained AbExp, a model that yielded 12% average precision by combining in a tissue-specific fashion expression variability with variant effects on isoforms and on aberrant splicing. Integrating expression measurements from clinically accessible tissues led to another two-fold improvement. Furthermore, we show on UK Biobank blood traits that performing rare variant association testing using the continuous and tissue-specific AbExp variant scores instead of LOFTEE variant burden increases gene discovery sensitivity and enables improved phenotype predictions."

Here, we developed a high-throughput method to synthesize and test the functionality of all possible in-frame and continuous deletions in a gene of interest, enabling rapid and unbiased determination of protein domain importance. Our approach generates precise deletions using a CRISPR library framework that is free from constraints of gRNA target site availability and efficacy. We applied our method to AcrIIA4, a phage-encoded anti-CRISPR protein that robustly inhibits SpCas9. Extensive structural characterization has shown that AcrIIA4 physically occupies the DNA-binding interfaces of several SpCas9 domains; nonetheless, the importance of each AcrIIA4 interaction for SpCas9 inhibition is unknown. We used our approach to determine the essential and dispensable regions of AcrIIA4. Surprisingly, not all contacts with SpCas9 were required, and in particular, we found that the AcrIIA4 loop that inserts into SpCas9’s RuvC catalytic domain can be deleted. Our results show that AcrIIA4 inhibits SpCas9 primarily by blocking PAM binding, and that its interaction with the SpCas9 catalytic domain is inessential."

The authors of this article were responsible for producing a mathematical simulation for that documentary of how a highly contagious respiratory pathogen might spread across the UK. According to the documentary narrative, the ‘outbreak’ begins in the town of Haslemere, England. To ground the simulation in true human interaction patterns, a three-day citizen science experiment was conducted during which the pairwise distances between 469 volunteers in Haslemere were tracked continuously using a mobile phone app. Here, we offer a scientific companion to the documentary in which we describe the methods behind our simulation and release the pairwise interpersonal distance dataset. We discuss salient features of the dataset, including daily patterns in the clustering and volatility of interpersonal interactions. Our epidemiological analysis of the simulated Haslemere outbreak serves as a springboard to discuss scientific opportunities opened by the Haslemere dataset and others like it. We believe that the Haslemere dataset will productively challenge current strategies for incorporating population structure into disease transmission models, and hope that it will inspire the collection and analysis of other similar datasets in the future."

Pathogens experience selection on traits at multiple scales, including replication rates within host individuals and transmissibility between hosts. We analyze a stochastic model linking pathogen growth and competition within individuals to transmission between individuals. Our analysis reveals a new factor, the cross-scale reproductive number of a mutant virion, that quantifies how quickly mutant strains increase in frequency when they initially appear in the infected host population. This cross-scale reproductive number combines with viral mutation rates, single-strain reproductive numbers, and transmission bottleneck width to determine the likelihood of evolutionary emergence, and whether evolution occurs swiftly or gradually within chains of transmission. We find that wider transmission bottlenecks facilitate emergence of pathogens with short-term infections, but hinder emergence of pathogens exhibiting cross-scale selective conflict and long-term infections. Our results provide a framework to advance the integration of laboratory, clinical and field data in the context of evolutionary theory, laying the foundation for a new generation of evidence-based risk assessment of emergence threats."
Epidemiology,The role of “spillover” in antibiotic resistance,"Scott W.,Marc,Yonatan H.,Scott W.,Marc,Yonatan H.,Scott W.,Marc","Antibiotic use is a key driver of antibiotic resistance. Understanding the quantitative association between antibiotic use and resulting resistance is important for predicting future rates of antibiotic resistance and for designing antibiotic stewardship policy. However, the use-resistance association is complicated by “spillover”, in which one population’s level of antibiotic use affects another population’s level of resistance via the transmission of bacteria between those populations. Spillover is known to have effects at the level of families and hospitals, but it is unclear if spillover is relevant at larger scales. We used mathematical modeling and analysis of observational data to address this question. First, we used dynamical models of antibiotic resistance to predict the effects of spillover. Whereas populations completely isolated from one another do not experience any spillover, we found that if even 1% of interactions are between populations, then spillover may have large consequences: the effect of a change in antibiotic use in one population on antibiotic resistance in that population could be reduced by as much as 50%. Then, we quantified spillover in observational antibiotic use and resistance data from US states and European countries for 3 pathogen-antibiotic combinations, finding that increased interactions between populations were associated with smaller differences in antibiotic resistance between those populations. Thus, spillover may have an important impact at the level of states and countries, which has ramifications for predicting the future of antibiotic resistance, designing antibiotic resistance stewardship policy, and interpreting stewardship interventions."

Individuals predominantly interact with a small number of close companions while maintaining weaker social bonds with less familiar group members. By incorporating this behaviour into a mathematical model we find that a single parameter, which we refer to as social fluidity, controls the rate of social mixing within the group. We compare the social fluidity of 13 species by applying the model to empirical human and animal social interaction data. To investigate how social behavior influences the likelihood of an epidemic outbreak we derive an analytical expression of the relationship between social fluidity and the basic reproductive number of an infectious disease. For highly fluid social behaviour disease transmission is revealed to be density-dependent. For species that form more stable social bonds, the model describes frequency-dependent transmission that is sensitive to changes in social fluidity."

In this study, we generated a pangenome of pigs and a genome variation map of 599 deep-sequenced genomes across Eurasia. Moreover, a section-wide gene repertoire was constructed, which indicated that core genes were more evolutionarily conserved than variable genes. Subsequently, we identified 546,137 SVs, their enrichment regions, and relationships with genomic features and found significant divergence across Eurasian pigs. More importantly, the pangenome-detected SVs could complement heritability estimates and genome-wide association studies based only on single nucleotide polymorphisms. Among the SVs shaped by selection, we identified an insertion in the promoter region of the "

In this paper we identify unique genomic regions using a highly efficient method based on fast string matching. We quantify the resource consumption and accuracy of this method before applying it to the genomes of 18 mammals. We annotate their unique regions of at least 10 kb and find that they are strongly enriched for developmental genes across the board. When investigating the subset of unique regions that lack annotations, we found in the tasmanian devil the gene encoding iniositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase A, which is an essential part of intracellular signaling. This implies that unique regions might be given priority when annotating mammalian genomes.

Genomics,High-Resolution Genome-Wide Mapping of Chromatin Accessibility and Torsional Stress,"Porter M.,Lauren A.,Lu,Marcus B.,B. Franklin,Michelle D.,Porter M.,Lauren A.,Lu,Marcus B.,B. Franklin,Michelle D.,Porter M.,Lauren A.,Lu,Marcus B.,B. Franklin","Torsional stress in chromatin plays a fundamental role in cellular functions, influencing key processes such as transcription, replication, and chromatin organization. Transcription and other processes may generate and be regulated by torsional stress. In the genome, the interplay of these processes creates complicated patterns of both positive (+) and negative (-) torsion. However, a challenge in generating an accurate torsion map is determining the zero-torsion baseline signal, which is conflated with chromatin accessibility. Here, we introduce a high-resolution method based on the intercalator trimethylpsoralen (TMP) to address this challenge. We describe a method to establish the zero-torsion baseline while preserving the chromatin state of the genome. This approach enables both high-resolution mapping of accessibility and torsional stress in chromatin in the cell. Our analysis reveals transcription-generated torsional domains consistent with the twin-supercoiled-domain model of transcription and suggests a role for torsional stress in recruiting topoisomerases and in regulating 3D genome architecture via cohesin. This new method provides a potential path forward for using TMP to measure torsional stress in the genome without the confounding contribution of accessibility in chromatin."
Genomics,A Suite of Foundation Models Captures the Contextual Interplay Between Codons,"Mohsen,Siyu,Mathew K.,Christian B.,Ali,Timo,Mohammad R. K.,Willow,Hani,Mohsen,Siyu,Mathew K.,Christian B.,Ali,Timo,Mohammad R. K.,Willow,Hani,Mohsen,Siyu,Mathew K.,Christian B.,Ali,Timo,Mohammad R. K.,Willow","In the canonical genetic code, many amino acids are assigned more than one codon. Work by us and others has shown that the choice of these synonymous codon is not random, and carries regulatory and functional consequences. Existing protein foundation models ignore this context-dependent role of coding sequence in shaping the protein landscape of the cell. To address this gap, we introduce cdsFM, a suite of codon-resolution large language models, including both EnCodon and DeCodon models, with up to 1B parameters. Pre-trained on 60 million protein-coding sequences from more than 5,000 species, our models effectively learn the relationship between codons and amino acids, recapitualing the overall structure of the genetic code. In addition to outperforming state-of-the-art genomic foundation models in a variety of zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks, the larger pre-trained models were superior in predicting the choice of synonymous codons. To systematically assess the impact of synonymous codon choices on protein expression and our models’ ability to capture these effects, we generated a large dataset measuring overall and surface expression levels of three proteins as a function of changes in their synonymous codons. We showed that our EnCodon models could be readily fine-tuned to predict the contextual consequences of synonymous codon choices. Armed with this knowledge, we applied EnCodon to existing clinical datasets of synonymous variants, and we identified a large number of synonymous codons that are likely pathogenic, several of which we experimentally confirmed in a cellbased model. Together, our findings establish the cdsFM suite as a powerful tool for decoding the complex functional grammar underlying the choice of synonymous codons."

However, current state-of-the-art models have been trained largely on bulk expression profiles from healthy tissues or cell lines, and have not learned the properties of precise cell types and states that are captured in large-scale single-cell transcriptomic datasets. Thus, they lack the ability to perform these tasks at the resolution of specific cell types or states across diverse tissue and disease contexts. To address this gap, we present Decima, a model that predicts the cell type- and condition- specific expression of a gene from its surrounding DNA sequence. Decima is trained on single-cell or single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from over 22 million cells, and successfully predicts the cell type-specific expression of unseen genes based on their sequence alone. Here, we demonstrate Decima's ability to reveal the cis-regulatory mechanisms driving cell type-specific gene expression and its changes in disease, to predict non-coding variant effects at cell type resolution, and to design regulatory DNA elements with precisely tuned, context-specific functions."
Genomics,Public RNA-seq data are not representative of global human diversity,"Irene Gallego,Grace,Audrey M.,Lani,Isobel J.,Ryan,Nicholas,Selina,Amanda J.,Irene Gallego,Grace,Audrey M.,Lani,Isobel J.,Ryan,Nicholas,Selina,Amanda J.,Irene Gallego,Grace,Audrey M.,Lani,Isobel J.,Ryan,Nicholas,Selina","The field of human genetics has reached a consensus that it is important to work with diverse and globally representative participant groups. This diverse sampling is required to build a robust understanding of the genomic basis of complex traits and diseases as well as human evolution, and to ensure that all people benefit from downstream scientific discoveries. While previous work has characterized compositional biases and disparities for public genome-wide association (GWAS), microbiome, and epigenomic studies, we currently lack a comprehensive understanding of the degree of bias for transcriptomic studies. To address this gap, we analyzed the metadata for RNA-seq studies from two public databases—the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), representing 795,071 samples from 21,209 studies, and the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP), representing 167,389 samples from 649 studies. We also randomly selected 620 studies from SRA for detailed, manual evaluation. We found that 3% of samples in SRA and 21% of individuals described in the literature had population descriptors (race, ethnicity, or ancestry); 28% of samples in dbGaP had paired genotype data that was used to empirically infer ancestry. In SRA, dbGaP, and the literature, race, ethnicity, and ancestry terms were frequently conflated and difficult to disambiguate. After standardizing population descriptors, we observed many clear biases: for example, among samples in SRA that were coded using US Census terms, 69.0% came from white donors, corresponding to an 1.2x overrepresentation of this group relative to the US population. Among samples in SRA coded using continental ancestry labels, 55.6% came from European ancestry donors—an 4.1x overrepresentation of this group relative to the global population. These biases were generally similar across datasets (SRA, dbGaP, literature review), and were comparable to previous reports for other ‘omics data types. However, we note that, relative to other ‘omics data subsets like GWAS, there is considerably less information, of arguably worse quality, about who is participating in RNA-seq studies. Together, these results demonstrate a critical need to improve our thoughtfulness, consistency, and effort around reporting population descriptors in RNA-seq studies, and to more generally strive for greater diversity in this important data type."

Recent methods large-scale leverage multi-ancestry data to improve accuracy in under-represented populations but require labelling individuals by ancestry for prediction. This poses challenges for practical use, as clinical practices are typically not based on ancestry. We propose SPLENDID, a novel penalized regression framework for diverse biobank-scale data. Our method utilizes ancestry principal component interactions to model genetic ancestry as a continuum within a single prediction model for all ancestries, eliminating the need for discrete labels. In extensive simulations and analyses of 9 traits from the All of Us Research Program (N=224,364) and UK Biobank (N=340,140), SPLENDID significantly outperformed existing methods in prediction accuracy and model sparsity. By directly incorporating continuous genetic ancestry in model training, SPLENDID stands as a valuable tool for robust risk prediction across diverse populations and fairer clinical implementation."

Recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) have linked variation in a large number of genes with increased risk of ARHL for the first time. Amongst the strongest of these associations is variation in KLHDC7B, a gene of unknown function and one not previously linked to hearing. 
Methods: To confirm whether KLHDC7B plays a role in hearing we investigated auditory function in two independent knockout mutant mouse models of Klhdc7b:  Klhdc7bIMPC-/- and Klhdc7bD/D; on the C57BL/6N background and the B6.CAST-Cdh23753A>G background respectively. The B6.CAST-Cdh23753A>G background was backcrossed to correct a known age-related hearing loss (ahl) mutation in cadherin 23 present in both the C57BL/6N and C57BL/6J strains. 
Results: We showed that Klhdc7b is expressed exclusively in inner and outer sensory hair cells within the cochlea of mice at the RNA and protein level. Homozygous mutants for both knockout mouse models display a similar early-onset, progressive and severe hearing loss. Histological characterization of the two mouse models suggests that hair cells develop normally and are present in neonates. However, after the onset of hearing there is a progressive loss of outer hair cells in a gradient from base to apex of the cochlea consistent with the hearing deficit in the mice and the pattern of hearing loss in ARHL. Inner hair cells remain intact up to the latest age examined (~8 weeks). 
Conclusions: Our data suggests KLHDC7B is required for maintenance of auditory function rather than in its development, supporting the novel association with ARHL in humans detected in recent GWAS. To our knowledge, this is the first validation in mouse of an ARHL association in humans detected in a GWAS.  Our work also provides two distinct mouse models to further investigate the role of KLHDC7B in auditory function and for use in the development of therapeutic tools to prevent or treat ARHL."
Genetics,Accurate and flexible estimation of effective population size history,"Zhendong,Yao-ban,David,Zhendong,Yao-ban,David,Zhendong,Yao-ban","Current methods for inferring historical population sizes from DNA sequences often impose a heavy computational burden, or relieve that burden by imposing a fixed parametric form. In addition, they can be marred by sequencing errors or uncertainty about recombination rates, and the quality of inference is often poor in the recent past. We propose ""InferNo"" for flexible, nonparametric inference of effective population sizes. It requires modest computing resources and little prior knowledge of the recombination and mutation maps, and is robust to sequencing error and gene conversion. We illustrate the statistical and computational advantages of InferNo over previous approaches using a range of simulation scenarios. In particular, we demonstrate the ability of InferNo to exploit biobank-scale datasets for accurate inference of rapid population size changes in the recent past. We also apply Inferno to worldwide human data, finding remarkable similarities in inferences from different populations in the same region. Unlike previous studies, we show two historic bottlenecks for most of the non-African populations."

Epidemiology,Cohort-based smoothing methods for age-specific contact rates,"Yannick,Oswaldo,Christel,Carlo G.,Niel,Yannick,Oswaldo,Christel,Carlo G.,Niel,Yannick,Oswaldo,Christel,Carlo G.","The use of social contact rates is widespread in infectious disease modeling since it has been shown that they are key driving forces of important epidemiological parameters. Quantification of contact patterns is crucial to parametrize dynamic transmission models and to provide insights on the (basic) reproduction number. Information on social interactions, can (for instance) be obtained from population-based contact surveys, such as the European Commission project POLYMOD. Estimation of age-specific contact rates from these studies is often done using a piecewise constant approach or bivariate smoothing techniques. For the latter, typically, smoothing is done in the dimensions of the respondent’s and contact’s age. We propose a new flexible strategy based on a smoothing constrained approach - taking into account the reciprocal nature of contacts - where the contact rates are assumed smooth from a cohort perspective as well as from the age distribution of contacts. This is achieved by smoothing over the diagonal components (including all subdiagonals) of the social contact matrix. This approach is supported by the fact that people age with time and thus motivates smoothly varying contact rates from a cohort angle. Two approaches that allow for smoothing of social contact data over cohorts are proposed namely, (1) reordering of the diagonal components of the social contact matrix; and (2) reordering of the penalty matrix associated with the diagonal components. Parameter estimation is done in the likelihood framework by using constrained penalized iterative reweighted least squares (C-PIRLS), under Poisson and negative Binomial distributional assumptions for the observed contacts. A simulation study underlines the benefits of cohort-based smoothing based on two scalar measures of performance. Finally, the proposed methods are illustrated on the Belgian POLYMOD data of 2006.

The global expansion of aquaculture, coupled with the increased movement of commercial species, has raised concerns about the potential for introducing parasites into new environments, posing a growing threat to marine ecosystems. Polydora websteri is a shell boring polydorin worm that induces the formation of mud-filled blisters within the shells of molluscs. The annelid is considered indigenous to the Asian coasts and has been documented in various locations across the globe. In the present work, we report a massive presence of P. websteri in several sites of the North Adriatic costline and we provide some diagnostic features that are useful to identify the species. Polydora websteri can be distinguished of a lateral flange on chaetiger 5. Moreover the palps are characterized by continuous black lines along the margins of the ciliated groove. The combined findings of this study provide compelling evidence that P. websteri is expanding its range within the Mediterranean coast. Given the potential for severe ecological and economic impacts associated with this invasive polychaete, this study serves as an urgent call to action for increased monitoring of P. websteri in both farmed and wild Pacific oysters in the Mediterranean Sea.

Extensive evidence now underscores the profound impact of species loss on the stability and dynamics of ecosystem functions. However, it remains unclear whether the loss of genetic diversity within key species yield similar consequences. Here, we delve into the intricate relationship between species diversity, genetic diversity, and ecosystem functions across three trophic levels (primary producers, primary consumers, and secondary consumers) in natural aquatic ecosystems. Our investigation involves estimating species diversity and genome-wide diversity (gauged within three pivotal species) within each trophic level, evaluating seven key ecosystem functions, and analyzing the strength of the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functions (BEFs). We found that, overall, the absolute effect size of genetic diversity on ecosystem functions mirrors that of species diversity in natural ecosystems. We nonetheless unveil a striking dichotomy: while genetic diversity was positively correlated with various ecosystem functions, species diversity displays a negative correlation with these functions. These intriguing antagonist effects of species and genetic diversity persists across the three trophic levels (underscoring its systemic nature), but were apparent only when BEFs were assessed within trophic levels rather than across them. This study reveals the complexity of predicting the consequences of genetic and species diversity loss under natural conditions, and emphasizes the need for further mechanistic models integrating these two facets of biodiversity."

Ecology,Origin of plant trait data matters: Shared species of Northwestern Europe and the Pannonian Ecoregion have different trait values in the two regions,"Judit,Peter,Judit,Peter,Judit","Trait-based ecology considerably increased our comprehension of various fields related to ecology and evolution. As measuring traits can be time-consuming and costly, analyses regularly gather trait data from databases instead of carrying out new measurements. However, intraspecific trait variability can cause considerable differences between the trait values of different population and regions. Here we evaluated whether intraspecific trait variability causes considerable differences in trait values measured in two different regions of Europe. We tested whether regionally measured trait data from the Pannonian Ecoregion differ from trait data of the same species originating from Northwestern Europe, by comparing data from the Pannonian Database of Plant Traits (PADAPT) and the LEDA Traitbase. We evaluated six traits of the same set of species: thousand-seed mass (TSM), seed bank persistence index (SBPI), leaf area (LA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf dry mass. We found that trait data from the two databases significantly differed for TSM, SBPI, SLA, and LDMC. Our results indicate that the markedly different climate of the two regions can cause substantial intraspecific trait variation, therefore, the geographical origin of trait data matters in trait-based analyses. The findings corroborate the assumption that regionally measured trait data and building regional databases are essential for reliable regional-scale trait-based studies. We conclude that for studies analysing traits in the Pannonian Ecoregion (and possibly in Easter and Central Europe in general), it is advisable to use PADAPT instead of databases compiling data from regions with markedly different climatic conditions."
Ecology,Annual Variability in Diffuse Ratio and Spectral Characteristics of Solar Radiation: Cloud Effects in a Temperate Monsoon Region,"Amila Nuwan,Atsushi,Amila Nuwan,Atsushi,Amila Nuwan","Solar radiation (SR) dynamics have a profound effect on plant growth, development, and ecosystems, and they act as a primary energy source and important environmental signal that plants perceive through their photoreceptors, which primarily sense critical wavelength ratios (CWRs). The diffuse fraction of solar radiation (DF) is a key factor affecting the quality and distribution of light within the plant canopy. We analyzed one year of SR spectral observations measured by a ground-based rotating shadow-band spectroradiometer to evaluate the potential effects of DF and CWRs on plants in an outdoor environment in Fukuoka, Japan. The daily mean DF and all considered CWRs showed significant seasonal variations regardless of the solar meridian altitude. Cloudy or partly cloudy skies were prevalent throughout the year. The ratios of ultraviolet-A (UV-A)/UV-B, red (R)/blue (B), and R/green (G) increased during winter and decreased during summer. Conversely, the ratios of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)/global solar radiation (GSI), UV/GSI, UV/PAR, B/G, R/far-red (FR), and UV-B/B increased during summer and decreased during winter. Most of the CWR correlated with DF. Furthermore, our study discovered a synergistic influence of air mass (AM), water vapor pressure (VP), and DF on specific CWRs, which play a crucial role in plant light signal processing. This highlights the potential influence of AM, VP, and DF on plant light signals, thereby opening avenues for developing innovative plant growth models and ecological responses incorporating plant photoreception."
Ecology,Incorporating climatic extremes using the GEV distribution improves SDM range edge performance,"Ward,Josep Serra,Bart,Koenraad,Ward,Josep Serra,Bart,Koenraad,Ward,Josep Serra,Bart","Aim: The changing frequency and intensity of climatic extremes due to climate change can have sudden and adverse impacts on the distribution of species. While species distribution modelling is a vital tool in ecological applications, current approaches fail to fully capture the distribution of climatic extremes, particularly of rare events with the most disruptive potential. Especially at the edges of species' ranges, where conditions are already less favourable, predictions might be inaccurate when these extremes are not well represented.
Location: Europe.
Taxon: Tree species.
Methods: We present a novel approach to integrate extreme events into species distribution models based on the generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution. This distribution, following from the extreme value theory has been established as a valuable tool in analysing climatic extremes, both in an ecological context and beyond. The approach relying on the GEV distribution is broadly applicable, readily transferable across species and relies on widely available data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for 28 European tree species, illustrating its superior ability to fully capture the distribution of climatic extremes compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Results: We found that incorporating parameters on climatic extremes derived from the GEV distribution increased model performance (AICmodel) and characterized range edges more accurately (AUCedge) compared to competing approaches. However, general AUC values were only marginally increased across the species and study period analysed. Overall, the GEV model predicted a narrower niche for the species included in this study.
Main conclusions: Incorporating climatic extremes can impact spatial predictions of species distribution models, especially at range margins. We found that using the GEV distribution to characterise extreme variables in SDMs yields the best performance at these distribution edges. Given the importance of range edges for species conservation, a detailed inclusion of extremes in SDMs employed for those applications will help ensure robust conclusions."
Ecology,Competition for food affects the strength of reproductive interference and its consequences for species coexistence.,"Miguel A.,Oscar,Inês,Vitor C.,Sara,Flore,Miguel A.,Oscar,Inês,Vitor C.,Sara,Flore,Miguel A.,Oscar,Inês,Vitor C.,Sara","Competition for food and reproductive interference (negative interspecific sexual interactions) have been identified as major drivers of species exclusion. Still, how these biotic interactions jointly determine competitive dominance remains largely unknown. We tackle this by coupling population models and laboratory experiments with two spider mite sibling species. Using experiments specifically designed to measure the single and combined effects of food competition and reproductive interference, we first show that the strength and symmetry of reproductive interference between species changes in presence of food competition. Next, we show that population models incorporating each type of interaction alone or their effects when combined lead to markedly different predictions, from exclusion by one species or the other, to exclusion of the less abundant species. Moreover, accounting for the observed reduction in the strength of reproductive interference in the presence of food competition changes the threshold frequency determining the dominant competitor, favouring the superior competitor for food. Finally, model predictions for short-term population dynamics were corroborated with an independent population cage experiment. Altogether, our results suggest that trophic interactions can modulate sexual interactions, significantly impacting population dynamics and competitive outcomes. Hence, the joint consideration of food competition and reproductive interference is critical to accurately predict and understand species coexistence."
Ecology,The future abundance of key bird species for pathogen transmission in the Netherlands,"Martha,Henk,Peter M,Maarten JJ,Gertjan,Martha,Henk,Peter M,Maarten JJ,Gertjan,Martha,Henk,Peter M,Maarten JJ","Wild birds serve as reservoirs and vectors for many different pathogens and changes in their distribution and abundance due to environmental change will influence disease risk. We study three species which are highly abundant in north-western Europe and which can transmit a wide range of diseases including avian influenza and West Nile virus: blackbirds, mallards and house sparrows. Using the Netherlands as a case study, we created random forest models for predicting the distribution and abundance of these species, both now and in the future. Climate, land use and vegetative cover were all important predictors of bird abundance. The three species had different spatial distributions, largely related to their preferred habitat and food availability. In the future, mallard and house sparrow populations were predicted to increase, while there was little change for blackbirds. Quantifying the consequences of these abundance changes is complicated as there are many factors to consider, however increased pathogen reservoirs will likely increase disease risk and changes in distribution may affect local outbreak risk. The future abundance maps created in this study, and the methods used to create them, will be useful tools for disease modellers and policymakers to estimate future disease risk and to plan accordingly."
Ecology,Increase of tropical seabirds (Sula) in the California Current Ecosystem with warmer ocean conditions,"Tamara M,David M,James R,Maria,Jaima,Lisa T,Tamara M,David M,James R,Maria,Jaima,Lisa T,Tamara M,David M,James R,Maria,Jaima","Climate change is impacting marine ecosystems in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) through physical changes (e.g., an increase in the frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves) that manifest biologically at all trophic levels. We investigated range expansion into the CCE and correlations with environment for a group of tropical/sub-tropical seabirds. We assessed changes in the abundance (2002-2022) of five species from the genus, Sula (Cocos, Blue-footed, Red-footed, Masked, and Nazca Boobies), using a novel compilation of four data sources (at-sea surveys, n=82 observations, records from Southeast Farallon Island, n=600, the California Rare Birds Committee, n=593, and eBird -a citizen science mobile application, n= 20,529), and looked for relationships with the environment, including broad temporal and spatial scale dynamics (El Niño Southern Oscillation), local conditions where the bird was reported, and potential source conditions from Baja California Sur and the Gulf of California. All five species increased in abundance, and all, with the exception of Blue-footed, exhibited a northward range expansion by as much as 6.8 degrees latitude and increased range area of between 235-1013% within the CCE. There was increased abundance during warmer conditions (El Niño and warm SST) for Cocos, Red-footed, Masked, and Nazca Boobies, and all species increased by 692-3015% after the extreme marine heatwaves that began in late 2013. Our results document a tropical shift in seabirds of the CCE, which may present future challenges to resident species. As marine heatwaves are projected to increase in frequency and intensity, in addition to long-term warming, we hypothesize that these species will continue to expand their range northward in the CCE."
Ecology,General mechanisms for a top-down origin of the predator-prey power law,"Onofrio,Matthieu,Matteo,Onofrio,Matthieu,Matteo,Onofrio,Matthieu","The ratio of predator-to-prey biomass density is not constant along ecological gradients: denser ecosystems tend to have fewer predators per prey, following a scaling relation known as the ""predator-prey power law"". The origin of this surprisingly general pattern, particularly its connection with environmental factors and predator-prey dynamics, is unknown. Here, we explore some ways that a sublinear predator-prey scaling could emerge from density-dependent interactions among predators and between predators and prey (which we call a top-down origin), rather than among prey (bottom-up origin) as proposed in Hatton "
Ecology,Amazonian biocultural heritage under climate change,"Rodrigo,Patrick R.,Jordi,Rodrigo,Patrick R.,Jordi,Rodrigo,Patrick R.","Amazonia harbors one fourth of the world's plant diversity and over 300 Indigenous groups. So far, however, no study has assessed how climate change may simultaneously impact its biological and cultural heritage. To bridge this gap, we assembled a database on 5,833 utilized plant species and show that climate change will reduce more the ranges of utilized than of non-utilized species by 2070. Locally, Indigenous cultures may lose an average of 65% of their utilized plant species and 50% of their associated services from climate change. Regionally, the loss of threatened languages may result in a 41% reduction in the Amazonian knowledge pool. Overall, our results point to the strong climate vulnerability of Amazonian biocultural heritage."
Ecology,Ecological and socioeconomic factors associated with globally reported tick-borne viruses,"Samantha,Sadie J.,Samantha,Sadie J.,Samantha","Background: Public health resources are often allocated based on reported disease cases. However, for lesser-known infectious diseases, such as tick-borne viruses, disease risk reporting should account for more than just the biology of the disease and include mediating factors such as socioeconomics which can determine if an infection gets reported. Objectives: We aim to identify country-level ecological and socioeconomic factors important to reporting tick-borne viruses and examine whether countries with more economic resources have a higher likelihood of reporting resource intensive incidences. Our study goals are to determine potential country-level interventions that could enhance recognition of and reduce the health burden associated with tick-borne viruses. Methods: We apply machine learning to the most comprehensive tick-borne virus database, ZOVER, with a curated global trait matrix of 23 environmental and socioeconomic predictors. Results: We identified socioeconomic factors driving reported tick-borne viruses captured in the database at a country level. Countries that were more likely to report tick-borne viruses had a lower Gini Index (i.e., countries with less inequalities such as Nordic countries), increased dollars spent on pesticide imports, and had institutions (i.e., IVSA chapter) or individuals with agricultural, forestry, or veterinary knowledge (i.e., % of tertiary grads) present. Additional characteristics included countries with a lower percent of population exposed to conflict also had a higher probability of reporting a tick-borne virus. As expected, broad environmental factors such as the Koeppen-Geiger climate classification zone was important and identified Mediterranean climate or humid subtropical climate as environmentally suitable zones for reported tick-borne viruses. Discussion: For environmentally persistent pathogens, the role of ancillary factors mediating reporting must be considered for allocating resources to interventions. In addition, while direct interruption of transmission is important, socioeconomic interventions may be the greatest tool to reduce local disease burden."
Ecology,Investigating Honey Bee Pollen Foraging Patterns Across a Season Using DNA Metabarcoding,"Sydney N,Joshua G,Heather M,Sydney N,Joshua G,Heather M,Sydney N,Joshua G","The western honey bee, or Apis mellifera, is a vital pollinator, essential for both ecosystems and agriculture worldwide. As human influences on these bees become more pronounced, understanding their pollen foraging behavior is increasingly important. Pollen provides crucial nutrients for A. mellifera such as protein and lipids that are necessary for hive health and prosperity. Pollen DNA metabarcoding allows for the longitudinal analysis of the floral sources of corbicular (bee-collected) pollen. In this study we employ the use of metabarcoding and Oxford Nanopore Sequencing technology to analyze the floral composition of pollen samples collected on a weekly basis from two closely related hives. In total, we identified 74 distinct plant taxa (at the genus level) between the two hives. Although both hives had equivalent values of taxonomic richness and diversity, the majority of taxa identified were unique to the individual hives. This indicates a large degree of variation in pollen foraging despite the hives' relative proximity. In addition to this interhive analysis, we also analyzed changes in pollen origin of a single hive across the course of five months. We identified 59 distinct plant taxa within samples from this hive whose presence and relative abundance differ drastically on a weekly basis with no taxa being present in all samples across the observed time period. In addition, even though there was a median of 8 to 9 taxa detected in each sample, each sample was composed primarily of 1 to 2 taxa indicating a degree of foraging preference that changes on a regular basis. Further quantitative and qualitative comparisons completed in this study demonstrate the degree of variation in pollen foraging patterns both throughout the season and between hives."

Ecology,Avian predator-prey dynamics in a changing climate along the Western Antarctic Peninsula; a scoping review,"Tamara M,Victoria R,Tamara M,Victoria R,Tamara M","A unique characteristic of the food web along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), one of the fastest warming regions in the world, is that the avian tertiary predators seasonally rely on avian secondary predators for their subsistence. We conducted a scoping review to 1.) provide a summary of research on Antarctic avian predator-prey relationships, 2.) investigate potential avian predator-prey relationships and trends with the environment, and 3.) highlight research gaps and provide recommendations for future research. We searched Web of Science and Google Scholar for publications in English during any years. For our first aim, we searched using the terms ""predator-prey dynamics"" AND ""Antarctica."" We excluded results that did not include both avian predators and prey, which resulted in eight publications from around the Southern Ocean, and one along the WAP. For our second aim, we searched using the terms of each species' common and scientific names (gentoo penguin, Pygoscelis papua, Adelie penguin, P. adeliae, chinstrap penguin, P. antarcticus, southern giant petrel, Macronectes giganteus, south polar skua, Stercorarius maccormicki, brown skua, S. antarcticus) AND ""population"" AND ""Antarctic Peninsula."" We refined our results (N=59) to publications with data on at least one prey and one predator avian species of all papers found in Web of Science, and the first 100 records of Google Scholar. We selected five locations that had data spanning over 10 years and that spread across the northern WAP. We compared predator-prey species trends across time along with sea surface and air temperature. We found that predator-prey dynamics between avian secondary and tertiary predators have had limited investigations in Antarctica. Along the WAP, the relationship between different penguin species and avian tertiary predators are highly variable and many population trends are decoupled from local temperature change. We include recommendations for future data collection and research on these interactions."

Mark,Jonathan,Andrew,Paul,Margherita,Samantha  C.,Nyah,Karyn  L.,Salvador-Almagro","The Florida Mottled Duck (Anas fulvigula fulvigula) is a unique subspecies of waterfowl whose range is limited to peninsular Florida, USA. As an endemic species, Florida Mottled Ducks face numerous conservation stressors, such as habitat conversion and hybridization with non-native Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). In addition to these numerous stressors, Mottled Ducks are also contending with emerging and/or geographically expanding waterborne pathogens such as Vibrio spp., due to the effects of climate change. However, even given their conservation needs, little is known with respect to the health, physiology and the immunity of wild Mottled Ducks in Florida. Given this lack of data, we performed health assessments of Mottled Ducks in the Central Florida area. Specifically, we examined the humoral innate immune system, i.e., plasma, of Mottled Ducks in response to a common, but extraneous pathogen, Escherichia coli strain ATCC number 8739. We utilized a bactericidal assay (BKA) commonly used in eco-immunology, to provide insight into the bactericidal capacities of captured Florida Mottled Ducks. We statistically tested the BKA capacity of 23 Mottled Ducks in response to age and whole blood lead levels (Pb). We found that there was no statistically significant relationship between the covariates we measured and Mottled Duck BKA capacity against E. coli. However, the variability we observed in the BKA capacity of this subspecies warrants further research into additional physiological and ecological covariates coupled with potential immune stressors that Florida Mottled Ducks may be contending with."
Ecology,Biotic interactions and environmental filtering both determine earthworm alpha and beta diversity in tropical rainforests,"Arnaud,Mickael,Pierre,Emmanuel,Marie-Eugenie,Eric,Thibaud,Arnaud,Mickael,Pierre,Emmanuel,Marie-Eugenie,Eric,Thibaud,Arnaud,Mickael,Pierre,Emmanuel,Marie-Eugenie,Eric","Understanding the relative importance of biotic interactions, multiple environmental drivers, and neutral processes in shaping community diversity and composition is a central question for both theoretical and applied ecology. We analysed a dataset describing 125 earthworm communities sampled in 10 localities in French Guiana. DNA barcodes were used to delimit operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that we considered as species surrogates to avoid the taxonomic deficit and calculate community-scale species richness and pair-wise Sorensen beta-diversity. We used log-ratio and generalised linear models to highlight the effects of biotic interactions and environment as drivers of alpha diversity, and generalised dissimilarity models to figure out the relative contribution of space and environment to beta-diversity at different spatial extents. Community-scale alpha diversity was mainly explained by habitat filtering (soil texture) and interspecific competition that limit the number of locally co-existing species. Beta diversity between pairs of communities was mainly explained by distance when comparing communities in similar habitats, by topography and available soil phosphorus when comparing communities in different habitats, and by distance, elevation and climate when comparing all possible pairs of communities. While community composition is determined locally by neutral processes and environmental filtering, biogeographic processes linked to dispersal limitation and adaptation to local environment are the most influential on a regional scale. This highlights the complex interplay of dispersal limitation, biotic interactions and environmental filtering during the process of community assembly."
Ecology,One size does not fit all: a novel approach for determining the Realised Viewshed Size for remote camera traps,"Brendan M,Tal,Garrett M,Sean P,Eric,Brendan M,Tal,Garrett M,Sean P,Eric,Brendan M,Tal,Garrett M,Sean P","Camera traps (CTs) have become cemented as an important tool of wildlife research, yet, their utility is now extending beyond academics, as CTs can contribute to more inclusive place-based wildlife management. From advances in analytics and technology, CT-based density estimates of wildlife is an emerging field of research. Most CT-based density methods require an estimate of the size of the viewshed monitored by each CT, a parameter that may be highly variable and difficult to quantify. Here, we developed and tested a standardized field and analytical method allowing us to predict the probability of photographic capture as it varies within CT viewshed. We investigated how capture probability changes due to environmental influences, i.e., vegetation structure, ambient temperature, speed of subject, time of day, in addition to internal factors from CTs themselves, i.e., sensitivity settings, number of photos taken, and CT brand. We then summarize these spatial capture probability kernels into a Realised Viewshed Size (RVS)-the capture-probability corrected size of a CTs viewshed. We found that RVS values are heavily influenced by location-specific environmental factors, i.e., vegetation structure, technological delays associated with CTs themselves, i.e., refractory period, and internal CT settings, i.e., sensitivity, number of photographs taken. We also found that the RVS values computed using our methodology are substantially smaller than reported values in the literature. Imprecision surrounding CT viewshed areas can create propagating bias when implementing CT-based density estimators. Our method can change how practitioners consider photographs for use in CT density estimators thus increasing the reliability of CT-based density estimation, and contribute to more accessible wildlife management practices."
Developmental Biology,Evidence for strong cell-scale signalling during planar polarisation in the Drosophila wing,"Alexandre,David,Alexandre,David,Alexandre","In developing epithelia, cells become planar polarised with asymmetric localisation of the core planar polarity proteins to opposite cell membranes, where they form stable intercellular complexes. Current models differ regarding the signalling mechanisms required for core protein polarisation. Here, we investigate the existence of cell-intrinsic cell-scale signalling in vivo in the Drosophila pupal wing. We use conditional and restrictive expression tools to spatiotemporally manipulate core protein activity, combined with quantitative measurement of core protein distribution, polarity and stability. Our results provide evidence for a robust cell-scale signal, while arguing against mechanisms that depend on depletion of a limited pool of a core protein or polarised transport of core proteins on microtubules. Furthermore, we show that polarity propagation across a tissue is hard, highlighting the strong intrinsic capacity of individual cells to establish and maintain planar polarity."
Developmental Biology,Independent control of neurogenesis and dorsoventral patterning by NKX2-2,"Sumin,Elena,Julie,Hynek,Sumin,Elena,Julie,Hynek,Sumin,Elena,Julie","Human neurogenesis is disproportionately protracted, lasting >10 times longer than in mouse, allowing neural progenitors to undergo more rounds of self-renewing cell divisions and generate larger neuronal populations. In the human spinal cord, expansion of the motor neuron lineage is achieved through a newly evolved progenitor domain called vpMN (ventral motor neuron progenitor) that uniquely extends and expands motor neurogenesis. This behavior of vpMNs is controlled by transcription factor NKX2-2, which in vpMNs is co-expressed with classical motor neuron progenitor (pMN) marker OLIG2. In this study, we sought to determine the molecular basis of NKX2-2-mediated extension and expansion of motor neurogenesis. We found that NKX2-2 represses proneural gene "
Ecology,General purpose genotypes and evolution of higher plasticity in clonality underlie knotweed invasion,"Shengyu,Zhiyong,Peipei,Marc W.,Lei,Jingwen,Stacy B.,Yu-jie,Madalin,Wenyi,Hikaru,Jihua,Rui-ting,Oliver,Christina L.,Bo,Shengyu,Zhiyong,Peipei,Marc W.,Lei,Jingwen,Stacy B.,Yu-jie,Madalin,Wenyi,Hikaru,Jihua,Rui-ting,Oliver,Christina L.,Bo,Shengyu,Zhiyong,Peipei,Marc W.,Lei,Jingwen,Stacy B.,Yu-jie,Madalin,Wenyi,Hikaru,Jihua,Rui-ting,Oliver,Christina L.","Many widespread invasive plant species express high phenotypic variation across novel environments, providing a unique opportunity to examine ecological and evolutionary dynamics under global change. However, biogeographical studies often lack information about the origin of introduced populations, limiting our understanding of post-introduction evolution of introduced species in the new range. Here, we assessed the responses of Reynoutria japonica from 128 populations spanning three latitudinal transects in the native ranges of China and Japan, and the introduced ranges of North America and Europe. When grown in two common gardens in the native range, plants from introduced populations in North America and Europe differed in almost all traits from those from native Chinese populations, but were similar to plants from native Japanese populations. Compared to Chinese populations, North American, European and Japanese populations expressed lower trait values and plasticity in most traits. However, plants from both introduced ranges and from Japanese populations expressed higher clonality and plasticity in clonality than plants from Chinese populations. In addition, introduced populations expressed higher plasticity in clonality but lower plasticity in basal diameter compared to Japanese populations. Our study showed heritable differences in phenotypes between plants from the native ranges of Japan and China, and those from the introduced ranges were similar to the putative source of origin in Japan. However, we found that introduced populations may have evolved higher plasticity in clonal growth. Our findings emphasize the critical role of clonality and plasticity in invasion success, demonstrating the importance of discriminating between source and non-source native populations to identify ecological and evolutionary responses of invasive plants to novel environments."
Ecology,Invasive mammals disrupt native dung beetle community coexistence,"Ryo,Ryo,Shinji,Ryo,Ryo,Shinji,Ryo,Ryo","Biological invasions are among the major drivers of biodiversity and are increasing worldwide. Among the invasive species, mammals have a particularly profound impact on native ecosystems. As primary decomposers of mammalian feces, dung beetles are critical in ecosystem functioning, and their community structure is closely linked to their services. However, the introduction of invasive mammals threatens these beetles and potentially disrupts their ecosystem services. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the resulting changes in communities. We developed a novel population dynamics model focusing on the interactions among mammals, feces, and dung beetles. Our results indicate that such invasions increase the risk of extinction of specialist dung beetles that cannot utilize the feces of invasive mammals. The risk of extinction is particularly high when generalist dung beetles show a preference for native feces, leading to intensified interspecific competition for resources. Additionally,  the extinction risk of specialist dung beetles increases when invasive mammals display irruptive population dynamics. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that non-native mammalian invasions disrupt the coexistence of native dung beetle communities, potentially leading to losses in biodiversity and ecosystem function. These risks should be considered in future empirical studies to evaluate the impact of invasive mammals on dung beetle communities."
Developmental Biology,Single-cell and in situ spatial analyses reveal the diversity of newly born hematopoietic stem cells and of their niches,"Lea,Catherine,Sandrine,Yann,Anne,Lea,Catherine,Sandrine,Yann,Anne,Lea,Catherine,Sandrine,Yann","Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and more committed progenitors (collectively referred to as HSPCs) emerge from vessels during development, via Endothelial-to-Hematopoietic Transition (EHT). Recently, using the zebrafish embryo, we showed that two EHT cell types emerge from the aorta, raising the question of their subsequent fate. To address this issue, we established a complex pipeline based on single-cell photoconversion and transgenic lines to characterize the transcriptomic profiles of single EHT cell type progenies. We obtained, at unprecedented resolution in the early larva, a cartography of HSPCs and highly diversified differentiated populations, notably NK-like cell types, innate lymphoid cells and early eosinophils. We show that the two EHT cell types previously characterized indeed lead to differentially fated cells, with significant differences in thymus colonization and T-lymphoid lineage commitment. Using HSPC signatures retrieved from our datasets -  namely gata2b and cd34/podocalyxin -, and to address niches, we performed in situ gene expression analyses via RNAscope. Unexpectedly, we unveil a niche contacting the supra-intestinal artery. Finally, integration with previous datasets reveal that our populations contain potential developmental HSCs bearing signatures highly similar with adult HSCs."
Developmental Biology,The evolutionary modifications of a GoLoco motif in the AGS protein facilitate micromere formation in the sea urchin embryo,"Natsuko,Florence D.M.,Annaliese,Mamiko,Natsuko,Florence D.M.,Annaliese,Mamiko,Natsuko,Florence D.M.,Annaliese","The evolutionary introduction of asymmetric cell division (ACD) into the developmental program facilitates the formation of a new cell type, contributing to developmental diversity and, eventually, to species diversification. The micromere of the sea urchin embryo may serve as one of those examples: An ACD at the 16-cell stage forms micromeres unique to echinoids among echinoderms. We previously reported that a polarity factor, Activator of G-protein Signaling (AGS), plays a crucial role in micromere formation. However, AGS and its associated ACD factors are present in all echinoderms and across most metazoans, leaving a question of what evolutionary modification of AGS protein or its surrounding molecular environment contributed to the evolutionary acquisition of micromeres only in echinoids. In this study, we learned that the GoLoco motifs at the AGS C-terminus play critical roles in regulating micromere formation in sea urchin embryos. Further, other echinoderms AGS or chimeric AGS that contain the C-terminus of AGS orthologs from various organisms showed varied localization and function in micromere formation. In contrast, the sea star or the pencil urchin orthologs of other ACD factors were consistently localized at the vegetal cortex in the sea urchin embryo, suggesting that AGS may be a unique variable factor that facilitates ACD diversity among echinoderms. Consistently, sea urchin AGS appears to facilitate micromere-like cell formation and accelerate the enrichment timing of the germline factor Vasa during early embryogenesis of the pencil urchin, an ancestral type of sea urchin. Based on these observations, we propose that the molecular evolution of a single polarity factor facilitates ACD diversity while preserving the core ACD machinery among echinoderms and beyond during evolution."
Developmental Biology,The ,"Kara A,Kari F,Lauren,Stephen,Kara A,Kari F,Lauren,Stephen,Kara A,Kari F,Lauren","Niches are often found in specific positions in tissues relative to the stem cells they support. Consistency of niche position suggests that placement is important for niche function. However, the complexity of most niches has precluded a thorough understanding of how their proper placement is established. To address this, we investigated the formation of a genetically tractable niche, the Drosophila Posterior Signaling Center (PSC), the assembly of which had not been previously explored. This niche controls hematopoietic progenitors of the lymph gland (LG). PSC cells were previously shown to be specified laterally in the embryo, but ultimately reside dorsally, at the LG posterior. Here, using live-imaging, we show that PSC cells migrate as a tight collective and associate with multiple tissues during their trajectory to the LG posterior. We find that Slit emanating from two extrinsic sources, visceral mesoderm and cardioblasts, is required for the PSC to remain a collective, and for its attachment to cardioblasts during migration. Without proper Slit-Robo signaling, PSC cells disperse, form aberrant contacts, and ultimately fail to reach their stereotypical position near progenitors. Our work characterizes a novel example of niche formation and identifies an extrinsic signaling relay that controls precise niche positioning."
Ecology,Acute and chronic pesticide exposure trigger fundamentally different molecular responses in bumble bee brains,"Alicja,Federico,Andres,Richard J,Yannick,Alicja,Federico,Andres,Richard J,Yannick,Alicja,Federico,Andres,Richard J","Beneficial wild insects including pollinators encounter various pesticide exposure conditions, from brief high concentrations to continuous low-level exposure. To effectively assess the environmental risks of pesticides, it is critical to understand how different exposure patterns influence their effects. Unfortunately, this knowledge remains limited. To clarify whether different exposure schemes disrupt the physiology of pollinators in similar manners, we exposed bumble bees to acute and chronic treatments of three different pesticides: Acetamiprid, clothianidin, and sulfoxaflor. Gene expression profiling enabled us to compare the effects of these treatments on the brain in a high-resolution manner. There were two main surprises: First, acute and chronic exposure schemes affected largely non-overlapping sets of genes. Second, different pesticides under the same exposure scheme showed more comparable effects than the same pesticide under different exposure schemes. Acute exposure caused up-regulation of stress response mechanisms causing distinct regulatory changes, rather than amplifying the effects of prolonged low-dose exposure that affected predominantly immunity and energy metabolism.

Our results signal the need for safety testing practices to better consider mode-of-exposure dependent effects and suggest that transcriptomics can support such improvements."
Ecology,Suspended and sinking particle-associated microbiomes exhibit distinct lifestyles in the Elbe estuary,"Sven P.,Jason N.,Hans-Joachim,Shinichi,Vanessa,Wolfgang R.,Hans-Peter,Sven P.,Jason N.,Hans-Joachim,Shinichi,Vanessa,Wolfgang R.,Hans-Peter,Sven P.,Jason N.,Hans-Joachim,Shinichi,Vanessa,Wolfgang R.","Estuaries are important components of the global carbon cycle; exchanging carbon between aquatic, atmospheric, and terrestrial environments, representing important loci for blue carbon storage and greenhouse gas emissions. Estuarine particles are especially important due to their microbial transformation and vertical/horizontal transport. We used metagenomes and metatranscriptomes to assess changes in microbial community composition and functions across the Elbe estuary over one year, linking changes to dissolved and particulate organic matter. We will be the first to link microbial activity derived from molecular data to particulate and dissolved organic carbon characteristics. There were no microbial species responses to the measured physicochemical and dissolved/particulate organic matter parameters, however Weighted Correlation Network Analyses showed significant spatial microbiome differences linked to the estuarine salinity profile. Meanwhile, suspended and sinking particle fractions did not show any community wide differences, but individual gene analyses revealed clear microbial lifestyle differences. Sinking particle-associated transcripts highly expressed competition and stress-responses genes, while suspended particle-associated transcripts favoured energy acquisition and growth. Transcription patterns further indicate that suspended particles may represent a mitigating influence on methane release via methanotrophy, while both suspended and sinking particles produce methane through the same gene complex. This notion suggests that increased sinking particle abundance, such as under high turbidity conditions, leads to increased methane production. Our findings further imply that urban activities such as dredging may have a high impact on greenhouse gas emissions, and higher suspended-sinking particle ratios may alleviate aquatic-atmospheric methane exchanges. Future studies should explore in detail the underlying mechanisms and controlling variables, in particular when taking predicted global changes into account."

Detailed, high-quality observations of when plants undergo seasonal transitions such as leaf-out, flowering, and fruiting are critical for tracking causes and consequences of phenology shifts, but these data are often sparse and biased globally. These data gaps limit broader generalizations and forecasting improvements in the face of continuing disturbance. One solution to closing such gaps is to document phenology on field images taken by public participants. iNaturalist, in particular, provides global scale research-grade data and is expanding rapidly. Here we utilize over 53 million field images of plants and millions of human annotations from iNaturalist – data spanning all angiosperms and drawn from across the globe – to train a computer vision model (PhenoVision) to detect the presence of fruits and flowers. PhenoVision utilizes a vision transformer architecture pretrained with a masked autoencoder to improve classification success, and it achieves high accuracy for flower (98.5%) and fruit presence (95%). Key to producing research-ready phenology data is post-calibration tuning and validation focused on reducing noise inherent in field photographs, and maximizing the true positive rate. We also develop a standardized set of quality metrics and metadata so that results can be used effectively by the community. Finally, we showcase how this effort vastly increases phenology data coverage, including regions of the globe where data have been limited before. Our end products are tuned models, new data resources, and an application streamlining discovery and use of those data for the broader research and management community. We close by discussing next steps, including automating phenology annotations, adding new phenology targets, e.g., leaf phenology, and further integration with other resources to form a global central database integrating all in-situ plant phenology resources."

Ecology,Cascading consequences of shifting ice phenology in an exploited lake,"Daisuke,Erin S.,Joelle D.,Donald A.,Daisuke,Erin S.,Joelle D.,Donald A.,Daisuke,Erin S.,Joelle D.","Ice phenology (onset and breakup of ice cover) regulates the timings of seasonal life history events of many animal and plant species in high-latitude lakes in the Northern Hemisphere, promoting the coexistence of species that share resources like food and shelter. Increasingly warmer, more variable Earth’s climate is, however, shifting ice phenology, modifying habitat conditions, and in turn reshaping the population and interaction dynamics of many species, threatening their persistence. Applying multivariate autoregressive state-space time series modeling to extensive historical and contemporary monitoring records (spanning 36 to 113 years) of limnological and biological surveys and fishery catches, we explore how shifting ice phenology propagates through a food web over time by modulating thermal profiles and limnological properties in Lake Simcoe, a large, intensely exploited system in southern Ontario, Canada. Analysis shows that increasingly earlier ice breakups, later ice freeze-ups, earlier thermal stratification onset, and later turnover since the early 1980s, attenuated algal production. This in turn, combined with increasingly more abundant invasive species (dreissenids) that promoted greater water clarity over prolonged stratification periods, diminished zooplankton abundances. These limnological changes filtered through plankton communities further modified the population and community dynamics of higher trophic-level species like fish with differential thermal preferences, interactively with time-varying non-climate drivers. Although management interventions–reductions in nutrient loading and fishing effort in particular–in recent decades aided the recoveries of depleted cold-adapted fish populations (including lake trout, lake whitefish, and cisco), their interaction patterns and strengths with species adapted to warmer conditions were reshuffled by advanced timings of ice breakup and delayed timings of ice freeze-up. These findings reveal how complex food web dynamics can emerge from ecologically divergent responses that reshape species interactions within and among trophic levels under shifting ice phenology filtered through bottom-up processes, likely buffering destabilizing effects of a changing climate."

We used single-cell RNA-seq data from chick embryonic neural tube to characterize the molecular mechanisms that drive this transition. Here we show that Cdkn1c, a key cell cycle regulator which is classically associated with neuronal cell cycle exit, plays an earlier role during neurogenesis by favoring a shift towards neurogenic mode of division. Cdkn1c expression progressively increases in neural progenitors, and its knock down leads to a reduction of neuron production, following a shortening of cell cycle mainly attributed to a reduction in G1 duration. Clonal analysis of pairs of sister cells indicates that reducing Cdkn1c expression in progenitors delays neurogenesis by favoring a symmetric proliferative mode of division. Combined CyclinD1 and Cdkn1c knockdowns restores the cell cycle defects and a wild-type distribution of modes of division, indicating that Cdkn1c acts via the regulation of cell cycle parameters. We propose a sequential role for Cdkn1c in neuron production, with its progressive expression in progenitors first promoting neurogenic division patterns via cell-cycle lengthening, before mediating cell cycle exit in daughter cells."

While Notch signalling requires direct membrane contact for its activation, we have previously shown mathematically that contact needs to extend beyond neighbouring cells for the HES5 pattern to emerge. However, the presence of cellular structures that could enable such long-distance signalling was unclear. Here, we report that cellular protrusions are present all along the apicobasal axis of individual neural progenitor cells. Through live imaging, we show that these protrusions dynamically extend and retract reaching lengths of up to ∼20μm, enough to extend membrane contact beyond adjacent cells. The Notch ligand DLL1 was found to colocalise with protrusions, further supporting the idea that Notch signalling can be transduced at a distance. The effect of protrusions on the HES5 pattern was tested by reducing the density of protrusions using the CDC42 inhibitor ML141, leading to a tendency to decrease the distance between high HES5 cell clusters. However, this tendency was not significant and leaves an open question about their role in the fine-grained organisation of neurogenesis."

However, the gene regulatory network controlling this process remains poorly understood. Focusing on targets of NHR-23, a key transcription factor that drives molting, we confirmed the Kunitz family protease inhibitor gene mlt-11 as an NHR-23 target. Through reporter assays, we identified NHR-23-binding sites that are necessary and sufficient for epithelial expression. We generated a translational fusion and demonstrated that MLT-11 is localized to the cuticle and lined openings to the exterior (vulva, rectum, mouth). We created a set of strains expressing varied levels of MLT-11 by deleting endogenous cis-regulatory element sequences. Combined deletion of two cis-regulatory elements caused developmental delay, motility defects, and failure of the cuticle barrier. Inactivation of mlt-11 by RNAi produced even more pronounced defects. mlt-11 is necessary to pattern every layer of the adult cuticle, suggesting a broad patterning role prior to the formation of the mature cuticle. Together these studies provide an entry point into understanding how individual cis-regulatory elements function to coordinate expression of oscillating genes involved in molting and how MLT-11 ensures proper cuticle assembly."

However, little is known about the mechanistic basis and functional role of specific forms of EMT in cancer. Here we address this question in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells that enter a dormancy period in response to TGF-β upon disseminating to distant sites. LUAD cells with the capacity to enter dormancy are characterized by expression of SOX2 and NKX2-1 primitive progenitor markers. In these cells, TGF-β induces growth inhibition accompanied by a full EMT response that subsequently transitions into an atypical mesenchymal state of round morphology and lacking actin stress fibers. TGF-β induces this transition by driving the expression of the actin-depolymerizing factor gelsolin, which changes a migratory, stress fiber-rich mesenchymal phenotype into a cortical actin-rich, spheroidal state. This transition lowers the biomechanical stiffness of metastatic progenitors, protecting them from killing by mechanosensitive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. Inhibiting this actin depolymerization process clears tissues of dormant metastatic cells. Thus, LUAD primitive progenitors undergo an atypical EMT as part of a strategy to evade immune-mediated elimination during dormancy. Our results provide a mechanistic basis and functional role of this atypical EMT response of LUAD metastatic progenitors and further illuminate the role of TGF-β as a crucial driver of immune evasive metastatic dormancy."

Using in vivo genetic engineering to study disturbed GLE1 functions under physiological conditions we demonstrate that inactivation of Gle1 impedes cellular function and organization and causes pre-gastrulation lethality due to defects in adhesion and lineage specification. In contrast, the knock-in mice genocopying LCCS1-associated GLE1FinMajor variant (Gle1PFQ/PFQ) survive prenatal period but die suddenly at mid-adulthood. Gle1PFQ/PFQ mice present irregular count and distribution of spinal motor neurons and impaired development of neural crest-derived tissues as demonstrated by defects in their sympathetic innervation of heart ventricles, paravertebral sympathetic ganglia volume, and adrenal chromaffin cell counts. Unlike previously reported for yeast and HeLa cells, analysis of molecular consequences of GLE1FinMajor variant identified normal poly(A)+ RNA distribution in Gle1PFQ/PFQ cells, which however were impaired in RNA and protein synthesis and simultaneously showed typical signs of cellular senescence. Gle1PFQ/PFQ also induced disturbed stress responses with significant changes in G3BP1-positive stress granule count.

Advances in interface tissue engineering require stratified biomaterials able to both provide local instructive signals to support multiple tissue phenotypes while also reducing the risk of strain concentrations and failure at the transition between dissimilar materials. Here, we describe adaptation of a thiolated gelatin (Gel-SH) hydrogel via selective amination of carboxylic acid subunits on the gelatin backbone. The magnitude and kinetics of HRP-mediated primary crosslinking and carbodiimide-mediated secondary crosslinking reactions can be tuned through amination and thiolation of carboxylic acid subunits on the gelatin backbone. We also show that a stratified biomaterial comprised of mineralized (bone-mimetic) and non-mineralized (tendon-mimetic) collagen scaffold compartments linked by an aminated Gel-SH hydrogel demonstrate improved mechanical performance and reduced strain concentrations. Together, these results highlight significant mechanical advantages that can be derived from modifying the gelatin macromer via controlled amination and thiolation and suggest an avenue for tuning the mechanical performance of hydrogel interfaces within stratified biomaterials."

However, the mechanisms by which TECs modulate immune cell population remain unclear, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we investigated how NSCLC cells tweak normal endothelial cells (NECs) into TECs and the subsequent effects on immune regulation. NECs were cocultured with various NSCLC cell lines, using 2D and 3D coculture models to evaluate TEC-mediated effects on immune cells. We show that direct coculture led to significant transcriptomic, proteomic and kinomic alterations in TECs, especially in pro-inflammatory pathways. We identified a downregulation of the co-stimulatory molecule OX40L in TECs compared to NECs, suggesting impaired T-cell proliferation support. While TECs showed a limited effect on CD8+ T-cell activation, TECs supported CD4 T-cells polarization into Treg and Th22 subsets. Moreover, TECs also promoted M2-like macrophages polarization, thereby potentially contributing to the TME immunosuppression. State-of-the-art single-cell RNA sequencing of 3D multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) revealed distinct TEC subpopulations, including an inflammatory subset with UPR signature. The latter was absent in 2D-cultured NECs but present in freshly isolated and 2D-cultured TECs from NSCLC patients. Importantly, we also identified within MCTS a perivascular M2-like macrophage subset, predicted to interact with TECs with MIF and Midkine signaling. In conclusion, TECs in NSCLC tumors play a pivotal role in remodeling the TME immune landscape by promoting immune suppression. This study highlights the complex immunoregulatory functions of TECs within our different in vitro models that mimic aspects of the TME. Our data may provide new insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting TECs or regulatory signaling to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in NSCLC."

Methods: We developed the Adaptive best subset selection algorithm and Genetic algorithm Aided Ensemble learning (AGAE) score through multi-cohort transcriptomic analysis of ICI-treated patients. The AGAE score incorporated gene-pairing, Adaptive Best Subset Selection for feature optimization, and a Genetic Algorithm for optimal basic learner identification. We explored correlations between AGAE score and immune microenvironments using multi-omics data. Potential targets were screened using 17 CRISPR datasets and validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments.
Results: The AGAE score demonstrated robust predictive power for ICI therapy outcomes, with lower scores correlating with enhanced treatment response. The AGAE score outperformed published signatures and conventional biomarkers. Lower AGAE scores were associated with increased immune cell infiltration, higher immunogenicity, and enhanced antitumor immune activity. The CEP55 was identified as a potential key target driving immune evasion through AGAE scoring and CRISPR screening. Experimental validation showed CEP55 downregulation attenuated tumor cell malignancy and augmented ICI therapy efficacy by modulating T cell responses.
Conclusions: The AGAE score was a potent predictor of ICI therapy efficacy, facilitating refined patient stratification. CEP55's role in the tumor microenvironment's immune response highlights its potential as a therapeutic target. Targeted interventions against CEP55 may improve immunotherapy precision."
Bioengineering,Direct M2 macrophage co-culture overrides viscoelastic hydrogel mechanics to promote fibroblast activation,"Leilani R,Mackenzie L,Steven R,Leilani R,Mackenzie L,Steven R,Leilani R,Mackenzie L","Fibroblast activation drives fibrotic diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis. However, the complex interplay of how tissue mechanics and macrophage signals combine to influence fibroblast activation is not well understood. Here, we use hyaluronic acid hydrogels as a tunable cell culture system to mimic lung tissue stiffness and viscoelasticity. We applied this platform to investigate the influence of macrophage signaling on fibroblast activation. Fibroblasts cultured on stiff (50 kPa) hydrogels mimicking fibrotic tissue exhibit increased activation as measured by spreading as well as type I collagen and cadherin-11 expression compared to fibroblasts cultured on soft (1 kPa) viscoelastic hydrogels mimicking normal tissue. These trends were unchanged in fibroblasts cultured with macrophage-conditioned media. However, fibroblasts directly co-cultured with M2 macrophages show increased activation, even on soft viscoelastic hydrogels that normally suppress activation. Inhibition of interleukin 6 (IL6) signaling does not change activation in fibroblast-only cultures but ameliorates the pro-fibrotic effects of M2 macrophage co-culture. These results underscore the ability of direct M2 macrophage co-culture to override hydrogel viscoelasticity to promote fibroblast activation in an IL6-dependent manner. This work also highlights the utility of using hydrogels to deconstruct complex tissue microenvironments to better understand the interplay between microenvironmental mechanical and cellular cues."

Yet the concept of mutant p53 GOF has been challenged.  Here, using various strategies to alter the status of mutant versions of p53 in different cell lines, we demonstrate that mutant p53 stimulates cancer cell invasion in three-dimensional environments. Mechanistically, mutant p53 enhances RhoA/ROCK-dependent cell contractility and cell-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) re-organization via increasing mevalonate pathway-dependent RhoA localization to the membrane. In line with this, RhoA-dependent pro-invasive activity is also mediated by IDI-1, a mevalonate pathway product.  Further, the invasion-enhancing effect of mutant p53 is dictated by the biomechanical properties of the surrounding ECM, thereby adding a cell-independent layer of regulation to mutant p53 GOF activity that is mediated by dynamic reciprocal cell-ECM interactions. Together our findings link mutant p53 metabolic GOF activity with an invasive cellular phenotype in physiologically relevant and context-dependent settings."

In U/V systems, sex determination occurs in the haploid phase, with U chromosomes in females and V chromosomes in males. Here, we explore several male, female and partially sex-reversed male lines of giant kelp to decipher how U/V sex chromosomes and autosomes initiate male versus female development. We identify a key set of genes on the sex chromosomes involved in triggering sexual development, and characterise autosomal effector genes underlying sexual differentiation. We show that male, but not female, development involves large-scale transcriptome reorganisation with pervasive enrichment in regulatory genes, faster evolutionary rates, and high species specificity of male-biased genes. Our observations imply that a female-like phenotype is the ground state, which is complemented by the presence of a U-chromosome, but overridden by a dominant male developmental program in the presence of a V-chromosome."

The functional groups are introduced by a photocatalytic reaction which acts as the handle for protein loading on SWCNTs. In this sp3 defect reaction, the optical properties of SWCNTs can be maintained. With a convenient bioconjugation reaction, the GOx could be covalently linked with SWCNTs. Compared to the non-covalent immobilization conjugates, the covalent conjugate sensor exhibits a much stronger optical response toward glucose, and the stability of the biosensor also increases in harsh conditions. At the same time, we also report the changing ratio of the original E11 and defected E11* peak during the bioconjugation reaction, which is also inspiring for reaction monitoring on SWCNTs."
Bioengineering,Development and Validation of a Comprehensive Tumor Treating Fields System for Glioblastoma Therapy: From Prototype Design to Preclinical Evaluation,"Xindong,Han,Zhiyong,Xian,Xindong,Han,Zhiyong,Xian,Xindong,Han,Zhiyong","Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Tumor Treating Fields (TTF) therapy, which uses alternating electric fields to disrupt cancer cell division, has emerged as a promising non-invasive treatment. However, the development and optimization of TTF systems remain challenging, with limited studies detailing the design and practical application of such systems. In this study, we developed a novel TTF prototype, focusing on the design and fabrication of key components such as the electrical signal regulation, transmission and corresponding therapeutic effects. We evaluated the system's efficacy through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. In vitro, we demonstrated significant inhibition of GBM cell proliferation under varying electric field intensities, with stronger fields showing greater efficacy. In vivo studies using a rat glioblastoma model revealed reduced tumor growth, increased apoptosis, and enhanced immune infiltration in the TTF-treated group compared to controls. This comprehensive study provides a valuable reference for TTF system development, offering insights into both the technical design and biological application of TTF therapy, and highlighting its potential for improving GBM treatment outcomes."

Bioengineering,Stress-free Bioprinting of Human Primary and iPSC-derived Islets with Retained Functionality,"Miranda,Ravikumar,Connor,Ben,Ruiqi,Rodrigo M.,Zhenghao,Alejandro,Prashant N.,Ipsita,Miranda,Ravikumar,Connor,Ben,Ruiqi,Rodrigo M.,Zhenghao,Alejandro,Prashant N.,Ipsita,Miranda,Ravikumar,Connor,Ben,Ruiqi,Rodrigo M.,Zhenghao,Alejandro,Prashant N.","Currently, Type 1 diabetes (T1D) can be treated through implantation of allogenic islets, which replenish the beta cell population, however this method requires an extensive post-implantation immunosuppressant regimen. Personalized cellular therapy can address this through implantation of an autologous cell population, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Cellular therapy, however, requires an encapsulation device for implantation, and so to achieve this uniformly with cells in a clinical setting, bioprinting is required. Bioprinting is dependent on having a bioink that is printable, retains structural fidelity after printing, and is supportive of cell type and function. The objective of this study was to design and develop bioinks that were compatible with printing islets. Here, we detail the successful bioprinting of both primary human islets and iPSC-derived islets embedded in an alginate/methylcellulose bioink, with functionality sustained within the construct for both cell lineages. Sc-RNAseq analysis also revealed that printing did not adversely affect the genetic expression and metabolic functionality of the iPSC-derived islets. Importantly, the iPSC-derived islets displayed comparable functionality to the primary islets, indicating the potential to act as a cell source alternative for T1D implantation."

Atrial myopathy, including fibrosis, is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, but the mechanisms underlying this association are poorly understood. Fibrosis modifies myocardial structure, impairing electrical propagation and tissue biomechanics, and creating stagnant flow regions where clots could form. Fibrosis can be mapped non-invasively using late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI). However, fibrosis maps are not currently incorporated into stroke risk calculations or computational electro-mechano-fluidic models. We present multi-physics simulations of left atrial (LA) myocardial motion and hemodynamics using patient-specific anatomies and fibrotic maps from LGE-MRI. We modify tissue stiffness and active tension generation in fibrotic regions and investigate how these changes affect LA flow for different fibrotic burdens. We find that fibrotic regions and, to a lesser extent, non-fibrotic regions experience reduced myocardial strain, resulting in decreased LA emptying fraction consistent with clinical observations. Both fibrotic tissue stiffening and hypocontractility independently reduce LA function, but together, these two alterations cause more pronounced effects than either one alone. Fibrosis significantly alters flow patterns throughout the atrial chamber, and particularly, the filling and emptying jets of the left atrial appendage (LAA). The effects of fibrosis in LA flow are largely captured by the concomitant changes in LA emptying fraction except inside the LAA, where a multi-factorial behavior is observed. This work illustrates how high-fidelity, multi-physics models can be used to study thrombogenesis mechanisms in patient-specific anatomies, shedding light onto the links between atrial fibrosis and ischemic stroke."

Viral mimicry has been previously described to augment anti-tumor immune responses and sensitize solid tumors to immunotherapy including colorectal cancer, melanoma, and clear renal cell carcinoma. Here, we found that targeting a novel, master epigenetic regulator, Zinc Finger Protein 638 (ZNF638), induces viral mimicry in glioblastoma (GBM) preclinical models and potentiates immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). ZNF638 recruits the HUSH complex, which precipitates repressive H3K9me3 marks on endogenous REs. In GBM, ZNF638 is associated with marked locoregional immunosuppressive transcriptional signatures, reduced endogenous RE expression and poor immune cell infiltration (CD8+ T-cells, dendritic cells). ZNF638 knockdown decreased H3K9-trimethylation, increased cytosolic dsRNA and activated intracellular dsRNA-signaling cascades (RIG-I, MDA5 and IRF3). Furthermore, ZNF638 knockdown upregulated antiviral immune programs and significantly increased PD-L1 immune checkpoint expression in patient-derived GBM neurospheres and diverse murine models. Importantly, targeting ZNF638 sensitized mice to ICI in syngeneic murine orthotopic models through innate interferon signaling. This response was recapitulated in recurrent GBM (rGBM) samples with radiographic responses to checkpoint inhibition with widely increased expression of dsRNA, PD-L1 and perivascular CD8 cell infiltration, suggesting dsRNA-signaling may mediate response to immunotherapy. Finally, we showed that low ZNF638 expression was a biomarker of clinical response to ICI and improved survival in rGBM patients and melanoma patients. Our findings suggest that ZNF638 could serve as a target to potentiate immunotherapy in gliomas."
Cancer Biology,Optical imaging of treatment-naive human NSCLC reveals changes associated with metastatic recurrence,"Paola Monterroso,Jesse D,Stephanie D,Charles M,Konstantinos,Kyle P,Narasimhan,Paola Monterroso,Jesse D,Stephanie D,Charles M,Konstantinos,Kyle P,Narasimhan,Paola Monterroso,Jesse D,Stephanie D,Charles M,Konstantinos,Kyle P","Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths, comprising nearly 25% of all cancer deaths [1]. The five-year survival rate of patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) remains significantly low given that over half present with locally advanced or metastatic disease at time of diagnosis, and experience tumor recurrence following therapeutic intervention [2,3]. Current evaluation techniques to assess treatment response are lacking, given they are implemented several weeks after treatment completion and are solely based on anatomical changes in tumor size, forgoing other criteria such as functional or metabolic changes. There is a critical need to identify surrogate markers early on following diagnosis, that aid in distinguishing patients based on their long-term outcome. Two photon microscopy (TPM) techniques provide non-invasive high-resolution information on cell metabolism within tissue by utilizing an optical redox ratio (ORR) of FAD/[NADH+FAD] autofluorescence. The goal of this study is to use the ORR and NADH fluorescence lifetime decay to identify measurable differences in optical endpoints of human NSCLC that are indicative of their long-term outcome. Twenty-nine treatment-naive NSCLC specimens were classified into metastatic and non-metastatic groups according to subject-detail reports. The ORR and mean NADH lifetime were determined for each sample, revealing a significant increase in the ORR for the metastatic group. Given that KEAP1 expression has previously been associated with poor patient outcomes, we stained our samples for KEAP1 and found low KEAP1 expression regions to be associated with higher ORR. A deep learning network base on Inception-ResNet-v2 trained on imaging endpoints (AUC = 0.68) outperformed a model built with only clinicopathologic features (AUC = 0.45), when classifying tumors based on their metastatic status. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using optical imaging of autofluorescence of metabolic cofactors to identify differences indicative of long-term patient outcome."
Cancer Biology,Molecular and cell phenotype programs in oral epithelial cells directed by co-exposure to arsenic and smokeless tobacco,"Samrat,Shefali,Vincent,Francois,Liesel,Claire,Cyrille,Marie-Pierre,Stephane,Assunta,Cecila,Akram,Zdenko,Michael,Jiri,Samrat,Shefali,Vincent,Francois,Liesel,Claire,Cyrille,Marie-Pierre,Stephane,Assunta,Cecila,Akram,Zdenko,Michael,Jiri,Samrat,Shefali,Vincent,Francois,Liesel,Claire,Cyrille,Marie-Pierre,Stephane,Assunta,Cecila,Akram,Zdenko,Michael","Chronic arsenic exposure can lead to various health issues, including cancer. Concerns have been mounting about the enhancement of arsenic toxicity through co-exposure to various prevalent lifestyle habits. Smokeless tobacco products are commonly consumed in South Asian countries, where their use frequently co-occurs with exposure to arsenic from contaminated groundwater. To decipher the in vitro molecular and cellular responses to arsenic and/or smokeless tobacco, we performed temporal multi-omics analysis of the transcriptome and DNA methylome remodelling in exposed hTERT-immortalized human normal oral keratinocytes (NOK), as well as arsenic and/or smokeless tobacco genotoxicity and mutagenicity investigations in NOK cells and in human p53 knock-in murine embryonic fibroblasts (Hupki MEF). RNAseq results from acute exposures to arsenic alone and in combination with smokeless tobacco extract revealed upregulation of genes with roles in cell cycle changes, apoptosis and inflammation responses. This was in keeping with global DNA hypomethylation affecting genes involved in the same processes in response to chronic treatment in NOK cells. At the phenotypic level, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in NOK cell viability, induction of DNA damage, cell cycle changes and increased apoptosis, with the most pronounced effects observed under arsenic and SLT co-exposure conditions. Live-cell imaging experiments indicated that the DNA damage likely resulted from induction of apoptosis, an observation validated by a lack of exome-wide mutagenesis in response to chronic exposure to arsenic and/or smokeless tobacco. In sum, our integrative omics study provides novel insights into the acute and chronic responses to arsenic and smokeless tobacco (co-)exposure, with both types of responses converging on several key mechanisms associated with cancer hallmark processes. The generated rich catalogue of molecular programs in oral cells regulated by arsenic and smokeless tobacco (co-)exposure may provide bases for future development of biomarkers for use in molecular epidemiology studies of exposed populations at risk of developing oral cancer."

Although highly efficient, radiation cause severe damages to normal tissue and radio-induced toxicities vary from mild pneumonitis to pulmonary fibrosis. The mechanism leading to these toxicities remain unclear. To investigate the molecular responses of human lung to radiotherapy, we analyzed, by single cell RNAseq, lung tissue resected in the vicinity of the tumor (i.e. treated with radiation) and compared the transcriptional profiles of the distinct lung populations from the same patient removed at distance from the tumor (i.e. non-treated with radiation). Analysis of six lung samples from patients suffering from Pancoast tumor, a rare lung malignancy that requires neo-adjuvant radiotherapy before surgery, revealed a strong induction of VEGF signaling after radiotherapy. Expression of VEGFA, one of the canonical pro-angiogenic ligands, was found upregulated in multiple cell populations in lung exposed to high doses of radiation. Irradiated capillaries, particularly gCap cells, expressing KDR/VEGFR2, present transcriptional profile similar to tip cells, characterized by sprouting and motility capacities. In addition, we identified a sub-population of alveolar macrophages expressing FLT1/VEGFR1, a receptor for VEGFA, in lung tissues treated by radiotherapy. Cell-Cell communication analysis revealed that FLT1/VEGFR1 positive macrophages interact with tip cells after radiotherapy through IL1B-IL1R signaling. Lastly, analysis of mouse single cell dataset confirmed the increase in the proportion of gCap cells presenting a tip-like phenotype after radiation injury. Altogether, this study describes, at the single cell level, the pro-angiogenic responses of human lung after radiotherapy. These results will lead to a better understanding of the physiopathology of lung radiation injury and may pave the way to optimize treatments to improve patients quality of life."

Protein amplification assays like real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) are sensitive yet currently limited to semi-invasive sample types such as cerebrospinal fluid because more accessible samples, such as blood, contain inhibitors. Here, we show that Nanoparticle-enhanced Quaking-induced Conversion (Nano-QuIC) can double the speed of reactions spiked with misfolded α-synuclein while increasing sensitivity 100-fold in human plasma. Nano-QuIC detected spike concentrations down to 90 pg/ml in lysed whole blood, while reactions without nanoparticles (RT-QuIC) failed to have any detection due to the presence of strong inhibitors. Moreover, Nano-QuIC showed increased seeding activity in plasma samples from Parkinson disease patients (n=4) versus healthy controls (n=4). This sets the groundwork for the noninvasive diagnostic use of Nano-QuIC, potentially enabling early disease detection and management through blood-based testing."

The role of DDX41 in hematopoiesis and how its germline and somatic mutations contribute to MNs remain unclear. Here we show that DDX41 is essential for erythropoiesis but dispensable for the development of other hematopoietic lineages. Using stage-specific Cre models for erythropoiesis, we reveal that Ddx41 knockout in early erythropoiesis is embryonically lethal, while knockout in late-stage terminal erythropoiesis allows mice to survive with normal blood counts. DDX41 deficiency induces a significant upregulation of G-quadruplexes (G4), noncanonical DNA structures that tend to accumulate in the early stages of erythroid precursors. We show that DDX41 co-localizes with G4 on the erythroid genome. DDX41 directly binds to and dissolves G4, which is significantly compromised in MN-associated DDX41 mutants. Accumulation of G4 by DDX41 deficiency induces erythroid genome instability, defects in ribosomal biogenesis, and upregulation of p53. However, p53 deficiency does not rescue the embryonic death of Ddx41 hematopoietic-specific knockout mice. In parallel, genome instability also activates the cGas-Sting pathway, which is detrimental to survival since cGas-deficient and hematopoietic-specific Ddx41 knockout mice are viable without detectable hematologic phenotypes, although these mice continue to show erythroid ribosomal defects and upregulation of p53. These findings are further supported by data from a DDX41 mutated MN patient and human iPSC-derived bone marrow organoids. Our study establishes DDX41 as a G4 dissolver, essential for erythroid genome stability and suppressing the cGAS-STING pathway."
Bioengineering,Mimicking mechanics: A comparison of meat and meat analogs,"Skyler R.,Ellen,Skyler R.,Ellen,Skyler R.","The texture of meat is one of the most important features to mimic when developing meat analogs. Both protein source and processing method impact the texture of the final product. We can distinguish three types of mechanical tests to quantify the textural differences between meat and meat analogs: puncture-type, rheological torsion tests, and classical mechanical tests of tension, compression, and bending. Here we compile the shear force and stiffness values of whole and comminuted meats and meat analogs from the two most popular tests for meat, the Warner-Bratzler shear test and the double-compression texture profile analysis. Our results suggest that, with the right fine-tuning, today's meat analogs are well capable of mimicking the mechanics of real meat. While Warner-Bratzler shear tests and texture profile analysis provide valuable information about the tenderness and sensory perception of meat, both tests suffer from a lack of standardization, which limits cross-study comparisons. Here we provide guidelines to standardize meat testing and report the meat stiffness as the single most informative mechanical parameter. Collecting big standardized data and sharing them with the community at large could empower researchers to harness the power of generative artificial intelligence to inform the systematic development of meat analogs with desired mechanical properties and functions, taste and sensory perception."
Cancer Biology,"mTOR variants activation discovers PI3K-like cryptic pocket, expanding allosteric, mutant-selective inhibitor designs","Yonglan,Wengang,Hyunbum,Ruth,Yonglan,Wengang,Hyunbum,Ruth,Yonglan,Wengang,Hyunbum","mTOR plays a crucial role in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. We hypothesized that mTOR activation mechanisms driving oncogenesis can advise effective therapeutic designs. To test this, we combined cancer genomic analysis with extensive molecular dynamics simulations of mTOR oncogenic variants. We observed that conformational changes within mTOR kinase domain are associated with multiple mutational activation events. The mutations disturb the α-packing formed by the kαAL, kα3, kα9, kα9b, and kα10 helices in the kinase domain creating cryptic pocket. Its opening correlates with opening of the catalytic cleft, including active site residues realignment, favoring catalysis. The cryptic pocket created by disrupted α-packing coincides with the allosteric pocket in PI3Kα can be harmoniously fitted by the PI3Kα allosteric inhibitor RLY-2608, suggesting that analogous drugs designed based on RLY-2608 can restore the packed α-structure, resulting in mTOR inactive conformation. Our results exemplify that knowledge of detailed kinase activation mechanisms can inform innovative allosteric inhibitor development."

Aberrant chromatin 3D folding has been shown in many diseases, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and may contribute to tumorigenesis. The anthracycline topoisomerase II inhibitors can induce histone eviction and DNA damage. We performed genome-wide high-resolution mapping of the chemotherapeutic effects of various clinically used anthracycline drugs. ATAC-seq was used to profile the histone eviction effects of different anthracyclines. TOP2A ChIP-seq was used to profile the potential DNA damage regions. Integrated analyses show that different anthracyclines have distinct target selectivity on epigenomic regions, based on their respective ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq profiles. We identified the underlying molecular mechanism that unique anthracycline variants selectively target chromatin looping anchors via disrupting CTCF binding, suggesting an additional potential therapeutic effect on the 3D genome. We further performed Hi-C experiments, and data from K562 cells treated with the selective anthracycline drugs indicate that the 3D chromatin organization is disrupted. Furthermore, AML patients receiving anthracycline drugs showed altered chromatin structures around potential looping anchors, which linked to distinct clinical outcomes. Our data indicate that anthracyclines are potent and selective epigenomic targeting drugs and can target the 3D genome for anticancer therapy, which could be used for personalized medicine to treat tumors with aberrant 3D chromatin structures."

To understand adaptations to this space, we subjected leptomeningeal-metastatic (LeptoM) mouse breast and lung cancers isolated from either the leptomeninges or orthotopic primary sites to ATAC- and RNA-sequencing. When inhabiting the leptomeninges, the LeptoM cells demonstrated transcription downstream of retinoid-X-receptors (RXRs). We found evidence of local retinoic acid (RA) generation in both human leptomeningeal metastasis and mouse models in the form of elevated spinal fluid retinol and expression of RA-generating dehydrogenases within the leptomeningeal microenvironment. Stimulating LeptoM cells with RA induced expression of transcripts encoding de novo fatty acid synthesis pathway enzymes in vitro. In vivo, while deletion of Stra6 did not alter cancer cell leptomeningeal growth, knockout of Rxra/b/g interrupted cancer cell lipid biosynthesis and arrested cancer growth. These observations illustrate a mechanism whereby metastatic cancer cells awake locally-generated developmental cues for metabolically reprograming, suggesting novel therapeutic approaches."

Shelley,Jeffrey R.,Darryl","Although generally unknown, the age of a newly diagnosed tumor encodes valuable etiologic and prognostic information. Here, we estimate the age of breast cancers, defined as the time from the start of growth to detection, using a measure of epigenetic entropy derived from genome-wide methylation arrays. Based on an ensemble of neutrally fluctuating CpG (fCpG) sites, this stochastic epigenetic clock differs from conventional clocks that measure age-related increases in methylation. We show that younger tumors exhibit hallmarks of aggressiveness, such as increased proliferation and genomic instability, whereas older tumors are characterized by elevated immune infiltration, indicative of enhanced immune surveillance. These findings suggest that the clock captures a tumor’s effective growth rate resulting from the evolutionary-ecological competition between intrinsic growth potential and external systemic pressures. Because of the clock’s ability to delineate old and stable from young and aggressive tumors, it has potential applications in risk stratification of early-stage breast cancers and guiding early detection efforts."

How aggressive breast tumors recruit neutrophils remains undefined. Here, we investigated the roles of TGF-β1 and TNF-α in the regulation of neutrophil recruitment by breast cancer cells. TGF-β1 and TNF-α are pro-inflammatory factors upregulated in breast tumors and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT), a process linked to cancer cell aggressiveness. We report that, as expected, dual treatment with TGF-β1 and TNF-α induces EMT signatures in premalignant M2 cells, which are part of the MCF10A breast cancer progression model. Conditioned media (CM) harvested from M2 cells treated with TGF-β1/TNF-α gives rise to amplified neutrophil chemotaxis compared to CM from control M2 cells. This response correlates with higher levels of the neutrophil chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL8 and is significantly attenuated in the presence of a CXCL8-neutralizing antibody. Furthermore, we found that secretion of CXCL1 and CXCL8 from treated M2 cells depends on p38MAPK activity. By combining gene editing, immunological and biochemical approaches, we show that the regulation of neutrophil recruitment and EMT signatures are not mechanistically linked in treated M2 cells. Finally, analysis of publicly available cancer cell line transcriptomic databases revealed a significant correlation between CXCL8 and TGF-β1/TNF-α-regulated or effector genes in breast cancer. Together, our findings establish a novel role for the TGF-β1/TNF-α/p38 MAPK signaling axis in regulating neutrophil recruitment in breast cancer, independent of TGF-β1/TNF-α regulated EMT."

This underscores the urgent need for less toxic, more effective therapeutic alternatives. Recent advancements in cancer immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapy, have revolutionized cancer treatment.

To search for novel protein biomarkers for actionable tyrosine kinase drivers of PDAC, we used a combination of two orthogonal protein analysis methods, western blotting (WB) and mass spectrometry (MS). That is, we used 1D/2D phosphotyrosine (pTyr) WB in combination with nano liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (NanoLC-MS/MS) to analyze homogenates of 6 PDAC tumor samples and 5 normal adjacent tissue controls. Surprisingly, we found a novel, abundant 55 kDa pTyr-protein in 2/6 tumor samples and identified it as mutated pTyr-desmin. Further proteomics analysis of the purified protein cut from multiple Coomassie-stained 2D gels revealed that the mutant amino acid, tyrosine (D399Y), is phosphorylated (pTyr). A possible role for mutant pTyr-desmin in PDAC metastasis is discussed, along with peptide inhibitor drugs."

Bioengineering,Whole-Process 3D ECM-Encapsulated Organoid-Based Automated High-Throughput Screening Platform Accelerates Drug Discovery for Rare Diseases,"Zhaoting,Hui,Yuru,Emmanuel Enoch,Bing,Zhaoting,Hui,Yuru,Emmanuel Enoch,Bing,Zhaoting,Hui,Yuru,Emmanuel Enoch","The use of organoids, especially patient-derived organoids, for high-throughput screening (HTS) is widely accepted due to their ability to mimic the three-dimensional (3D) structure, function, and drug responses of in vivo tissues. However, the complexity of handling extracellular matrix (ECM) components with traditional HTS devices leads to the utilization of suspension cultures in matrix-free or matrix-low conditions during HTS, which can alter their transcriptomic landscape and drug responses. Here, we develop a whole-process 3D ECM-encapsulated organoid-based automated HTS (wp3D-OAHTS) platform, which enables the rapid and accurate generation of uniformly distributed 3D cell-matrix mixture domes at the center of each well in 96-well plates. This approach replicates the process of manual organoid culture but with superior stability and reproducibility. Utilizing this platform, we screened 2,802 compounds on neuroendocrine cervical cancer organoids, a rare malignancy with significant unmet clinical needs. We identified 7 top hits that display strong anti-tumor effects with remarkably low half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC"

Yet, we remain reluctant to switch to a plant-based diet, largely due to the sensory experience of plant-based meat. Food scientists characterize meat using a double compression test, which only probes one-dimensional behavior. Here we use tension, compression, and shear tests–combined with constitutive neural networks–to automatically discover the behavior of eight plant-based and animal meats across the entire three-dimensional spectrum. We find that plant-based sausage and hotdog, with stiffnesses of 95.9±14.1kPa and 38.7±3.0kPa, successfully mimic their animal counterparts, with 63.5±45.7kPa and 44.3±13.2 kPa, while tofurky is twice as stiff, and tofu is twice as soft.

Bioengineering,Time-dependent computational model of post-traumatic osteoarthritis to estimate how mechanoinflammatory mechanisms impact cartilage aggrecan content,"Atte S A,Joonas P,Moustafa,Amir,Cristina,Alan J,Petri,Rami K,Atte S A,Joonas P,Moustafa,Amir,Cristina,Alan J,Petri,Rami K,Atte S A,Joonas P,Moustafa,Amir,Cristina,Alan J,Petri","Degenerative musculoskeletal diseases like osteoarthritis can be initiated by joint injury. Injurious overloading-induced mechanical straining of articular cartilage and subsequent biological responses may trigger cartilage degradation. One early sign of degradation is loss of aggrecan content which is potentially accelerated near chondral lesions under physiological loading. Yet, the mechanoinflammatory mechanisms explaining time-dependent degradation in regions with disparate mechanical loading are unclear and challenging to assess with experiments alone. Here, we developed computational models unraveling potential mechanisms behind aggrecan content adaptation. Incorporating mechanical strain-driven cell damage and downstream proteolytic enzyme release, fluid flow-driven aggrecan depletion, and fluid pressure-stimulated regulation of aggrecan biosynthesis, the models agreed with experiments and exhibited 14%-points greater near-lesion aggrecan loss after 12 days of physiological loading compared to without loading. This significant advancement in mechanistic understanding incorporated into cartilage adaptation model can help in development and guidance of personalized therapies, such as rehabilitation protocols and tissue-engineered constructs."
Bioengineering,Colorimetric detection methods of pH-sensing wound dressing for point-of-care wound diagnostics,"Katia,Farnoush,Katerina,Aylin,Simon,Katia,Farnoush,Katerina,Aylin,Simon,Katia,Farnoush,Katerina,Aylin","Chronic lower extremity wounds like diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a major complication of diabetes and the leading cause of lower limb amputations worldwide. Currently, DFUs are diagnosed through macroscopic evaluation, and molecular diagnostics are lacking for the disease staging, treatment selection, and evaluation of treatment success. There is a need for new diagnostic technologies combined with detection methods for point-of-care use. Preclinical and clinical data support the importance of wound pH as a biomarker in chronic wound healing, with DFUs typically exhibiting more alkaline pH values when compared to normal healing wounds. In a previous study, we developed a pH-sensing fluorescent bandage based on pyranine-loaded microparticles that were physically immobilized in an alginate hydrogel. Here, we present a second-generation pH-sensing bandage for colorimetric wound diagnostics. Pyranine was adsorbed at high concentrations onto microparticles to enable colorimetric signal detection. This approach leverages pyranine's ability to change color in response to pH variations through proton exchange properties with the wound fluid. The colorimetric properties of our bandage enable signal detection by two methods suited for point-of-care use: a smartphone camera and a cost-effective homebuilt RGB detector. Analyzing the color intensity of the bandage with Red, Green and Blue absorbance values, it is possible to correlate the RGB absorbance to a pH value in the clinically-relevant range to 6.0 to 9.0 in vitro and ex vivo, as the B values decreased with the increase in pH levels, as associated with DFUs. These findings indicate the potential of colorimetric detection using smartphone cameras or home-built absorbance detectors for rapid wound diagnostics at the point-of-care."

Bioengineering,Texture profile analysis and rheology of plant-based and animal meat,"Reese A,Ethan C,Valerie E,Marc,Skyler R.,Ellen,Reese A,Ethan C,Valerie E,Marc,Skyler R.,Ellen,Reese A,Ethan C,Valerie E,Marc,Skyler R.","Plant-based meat can help combat climate change and health risks associated with high meat consumption. To create adequate mimics of animal meats, plant-based meats must match in mouthfeel, taste, and texture. The gold standard to characterize the texture of meat is the double compression test, but this test suffers from a lack of standardization and reporting inconsistencies. Here we characterize the texture of five plant-based and three animal meats using texture profile analysis and rheology, and report ten mechanical features associated with each product's elasticity, viscosity, and loss of integrity. Our findings suggest that, of all ten features, the stiffness, storage, and loss moduli are the most meaningful and consistent parameter to report, while other parameters suffer from a lack of interpretability and inconsistent definitions. We find that the sample stiffness varies by an order of magnitude, from 418.9±41.7kPa for plant-based turkey to 56.7±14.1kPa for tofu. Similarly, the storage and loss moduli vary from 50.4±4.1kPa and 25.3±3.0kPa for plant-based turkey to 5.7±0.5kPa and 1.3±0.1kPa for tofu. All three animal products, animal turkey, sausage, and hotdog, consistently rank in between these two extremes. Our results suggest that--with the right ingredients, additives, and formulae--modern food fabrication techniques can create plant-based meats that successfully replicate the full viscoelastic texture spectrum of processed animal meat."
Bioengineering,Heterologous expression and optimization of fermentation conditions for recombinant ikarugamycin production,"Julia K.,Anna,Monique,Sebastian,Manuel,Tobias A. M.,Julia K.,Anna,Monique,Sebastian,Manuel,Tobias A. M.,Julia K.,Anna,Monique,Sebastian,Manuel","Ikarugamycin is a member of the natural product family of the polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PoTeMs). The compound exhibits a diverse range of biological activities, including antimicrobial, antiprotozoal, anti-leukemic, and anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, it interferes with several crucial cellular functions, such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein uptake in macrophages, Nef-induced CD4 cell surface downregulation, and mechanisms of endocytosis. It is therefore used as a tool compound to study diverse biological processes. However, ikarugamycin commercial prices are very high, with up to 1300 € per 1 mg, thus limiting its application. We therefore set out to develop a high-yielding recombinant production platform of ikarugamycin by screening different expression vectors, recombinant host strains, and cultivation conditions. Overall, this has led to overproduction levels of more than 100 mg/L, which, together with a straightforward purification protocol, establishes biotechnological access to affordable ikarugamycin enabling its increased use in biomedical research in the future."

Beyond cost and delayed graft availability, the patient-specific performance of engineered tissues poses serious concerns on their clinical translation ability. A more exciting paradigm consists in exploiting cell-laid, engineered extracellular matrices (eECM), which can be used as off-the-shelf materials. Here, the regenerative capacity solely relies on the preservation of the eECM structure and embedded signals to instruct an endogenous repair. We recently described the possibility to exploit custom human stem cell lines for eECM manufacturing. In addition to the conferred standardization, the availability of such cell lines opened avenues for the design of tailored eECMs by applying dedicated genetic tools. In this study, we demonstrated the exploitation of CRISPR/Cas9 as a high precision system for editing the composition and function of eECMs. Human mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (hMSC) lines were modified to knockout VEGF and RUNX2 and assessed for their capacity to generate osteoinductive cartilage matrices. We report the successful editing of hMSCs, subsequently leading to targeted VEGF and RUNX2-knockout cartilage eECMs. Despite the absence of VEGF, eECMs retained full capacity to instruct ectopic endochondral ossification. Conversely, RUNX2-edited eECMs exhibited impaired hypertrophy, reduced ectopic ossification and superior cartilage repair in a rat osteochondral defect. In summary, our approach can be harnessed to identify the necessary eECM factors driving endogenous repair. Our work paves the road towards the compositional eECMs editing and their exploitation in broad regenerative contexts."

With cargos containing nucleic acids and other proteins, EVs play key roles in intercellular communication and other biological processes and are widely regarded as promising biomarkers for disease detection. EVs are abundantly found in virtually every biofluid, including blood, urine, and saliva. While there are numerous technologies to isolate EVs in blood and urine, isolating EVs from saliva remains a challenge, as it is highly complex and heterogeneous—cells, debris, and other proteins can all inhibit the isolation of EVs by traditional platforms. Here, we employ the CandyCollect, a lollipop-inspired sampling device with open microfluidic channels, as a non-invasive and patient-friendly alternative for the capture of salivary EVs. The CandyCollect simplifies sample preparation by effectively pre-concentrating EVs on the device surface before EVs are eluted off of the CandyCollect, labeled with cholesterol-tagged oligonucleotides, and subsequently detected by qPCR with primers specific for the tagged oligos to enumerate the relative number of EVs. We demonstrate that downstream EV cargo analysis can be performed using Simoa. Overall, the CandyCollect ushers a new method to capture, enumerate, and analyze salivary EVs."
Bioengineering,A Streamlined High-Throughput LC-MS Assay for Quantifying Peptide Degradation in Cell Culture,"Samuel J,Abolfazl S,E. Thomas,Samuel J,Abolfazl S,E. Thomas,Samuel J,Abolfazl S","Peptides are widely used in biomaterials due to their easy of synthesis, ability to signal cells, and modify the properties of biomaterials. A key benefit of using peptides is that they are natural substrates for cell-secreted enzymes, which creates the possibility of utilizing cell-secreted enzymes for tuning cell-material interactions. However, these enzymes can also induce unwanted degradation of bioactive peptides in biomaterials, or in peptide therapies. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a widely used, powerful methodology that can separate complex mixtures of molecules and quantify numerous analytes within a single run. There are several challenges in using LC-MS for the multiplexed quantification of cell-induced peptide degradation, including the need for non-degradable internal standards and the identification of optimal sample storage conditions. Another problem is that cell culture media and biological samples typically contain both proteins and lipids that can accumulate on chromatography columns and degrade their performance. However, removing these constituents can be expensive, time consuming, and increases sample variability. Here we show that directly injecting samples onto the LC-MS without any purification enables rapid and accurate quantification of peptide concentration, and that hundreds of LC-MS runs can be done on a single column without a significantly diminish the ability to quantify the degradation of peptide libraries. We also show that column failure is evident when hydrophilic peptides fail to be retained on the column, and this can be easily identified using standard peptide mixtures for column benchmarking. In total, this work introduces a simple and effective method for simultaneously quantifying the degradation of dozens of peptides in cell culture. By providing a streamlined and cost-effective method for the direct quantification of peptide degradation in complex biological samples, this work enables more efficient assessment of peptide stability and functionality, facilitating the development of advanced biomaterials and peptide-based therapies."

We tested the hypothesis that pathologic mechanical stress could alter transcription to induce smooth muscle phenotypic class switching. Methods: Primary human intestinal smooth muscle cells (HISMCs), seeded on electrospun aligned poly-ε-caprolactone nano-fibrous scaffolds, were subjected to pathologic, high frequency (1 Hz) uniaxial 3% cyclic stretch (loaded) or kept unloaded in culture for 6 hours. Total RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, and quantitative immunohistochemistry defined loading-induced changes in gene expression. NicheNet predicted how differentially expressed genes might impact HISMCs and other bowel cells. Results: Loading induced differential expression of 4537 genes in HISMCs. Loaded HISMCs had a less contractile phenotype, with increased expression of synthetic SMC genes, proinflammatory cytokines, and altered expression of axon guidance molecules, growth factors and morphogens. Many differentially expressed genes encode secreted ligands that could act cell-autonomously on smooth muscle and on other cells in the bowel wall. Discussion: HISMCs demonstrate remarkably rapid phenotypic plasticity in response to mechanical stress that may convert contractile HISMCs into proliferative, fibroblast-like cells or proinflammatory cells. These mechanical stress-induced changes in HISMC gene expression may be relevant for human bowel disease."
Bioengineering,Humans Exploit the Trade-Off Between Lateral Stability and Manoeuvrability During Walking,"Rucha N.,Francis M.,Anna,Xenia,Keith E.,Rucha N.,Francis M.,Anna,Xenia,Keith E.,Rucha N.,Francis M.,Anna,Xenia","People use the mechanical interplay between stability and manoeuvrability to successfully walk. During single limb support, body states (position and velocity) that increase lateral stability will inherently resist lateral manoeuvres, decrease medial stability, and facilitate medial manoeuvres. Although not well understood, people can make behavioural decisions exploiting this relationship in anticipation of perturbations or direction changes. To characterize the behavioural component of the stability-manoeuvrability relationship, twenty-four participants performed many repetitions of a discrete stepping task involving mid-trial reactive manoeuvres (medial or lateral direction) in a Baseline (no external perturbations) and Perturbed (random mediolateral perturbations applied to their pelvis) environment. We hypothesized people would make systematic changes in lateral stability dependent on both environment (increasing lateral stability in the Perturbed environment) and anticipated manoeuvre direction (reducing lateral stability to facilitate lateral manoeuvres). Participants increased lateral stability in the Perturbed environment, coinciding with an increase in manoeuvre reaction time for laterally but not medially directed manoeuvres. Moreover, we observed lower lateral stability in both environments when people anticipated making a lateral manoeuvre when compared to medial manoeuvres. These results support the hypothesis that people behaviourally exploit the mechanical relationship between lateral stability and manoeuvrability depending on walk task goals and external environment."
Bioengineering,Antibiotic-Mediated Plasmonic Resonance on a Novel Nanopillar Metasurface Array,"Jacob,Jaewoo,Theodore,Sui,Ke,Jacob,Jaewoo,Theodore,Sui,Ke,Jacob,Jaewoo,Theodore,Sui","This study demonstrates a silicon nanopillar metasurface coupled with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) mediated by the presence of cephalexin antibiotics in solution for biosensing applications. A facile fabrication process was developed to create the metasurface on silicon wafers with a unique resonance signature. The resulting metasurface consists of periodic nanopillars approximately 180 nm in diameter, 210 nm deep, and with a controlled edge-to-edge separation of 200 nm. These dimensions were chosen based on a finite element method simulation that was used to investigate the ideal parameters to produce the desired resonance effect in the metasurface reflection spectra. Optimization of the nanopillar surface properties and the sidewall angle allowed for replication of the simulations. This metasurface was coupled with BSA-coated gold nanospheres (BSANS) to mediate the redshift of peak resonance wavelength values, occurring only in the presence of the antibiotic linker. The device fabricated herein exhibits a significant 22 nm wavelength shift resulting from changes to the local refractive index in the presence of the BSANS-antibiotic coupling. Further enhancement of the binding events is promoted by the LSPR hot spots formed between the nanoparticles and the metasurface allowing for sensitive and real-time detection."
Bioengineering,Odor sensory tests vs. In-silico prediction for the high-definition quantification of olfaction dynamics,"Islam  Mohamed Sayed,Kazuki,Kazuko,Megumi,Takahiro,Kazuhide,Islam  Mohamed Sayed,Kazuki,Kazuko,Megumi,Takahiro,Kazuhide,Islam  Mohamed Sayed,Kazuki,Kazuko,Megumi,Takahiro","The intricate dynamics of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the human respiratory system remain poorly understood. In the present study, we integrate odor sensory tests (OSTs) coupled with computational fluid dynamics and a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (CFD-PBPK) model to elucidate various aspects of the olfaction process. Safe yogurt-derived substances were incorporated in OSTs to prevent harmful exposure. Acetaldehyde was identified as a key active component in determining odor intensity, prompting further analysis of acetone and other four constituents of yogurt. Logarithmic correlations were established between the perceived odor intensity from the OSTs and both time-averaged absorption flux and equilibrium concentration within the olfactory mucus layer. These parameters were numerically captured, enabling the logarithmic approximation of odor intensity for different breathing profiles and the development of reliable prediction models for odor sensation based on quantifiable physiological parameters. The CFD-PBPK model captured detailed spatial and temporal variations of these parameters, which offers potential for future integrated/in-silico applications. Minor peaks of odor concentration were observed in the posterior olfactory regions during exhalation, revealing a retro-nasal phenomenon. Location-specific analysis revealed the nostrils and olfactory regions as the most accurate indicators of perceived odor intensity, proving the limitations of rough sensory assessments in the indoor/breathing zone scales. Acetone exhibited distinct absorption and desorption trends during the transitional phase between inhalation and exhalation, owing to the physical properties (diffusion and partition coefficients) that strongly characterize the olfaction dynamics."

Despite advancements in computational methods, accurately capturing these complex structural changes remains a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a method for predicting diverse functional states of membrane protein conformations using a diffusion model. Our approach integrates forward and backward diffusion processes, incorporating state classifiers and additional conditioners to control the generation gradient of conformational states. We specifically target the P-type ATPases, a key membrane transporter, for which we curated and expanded a structural dataset. By employing a graph neural network with a custom membrane constraint, our model generates precise structures for P-type ATPases across different functional states. This approach represents a significant step forward in computational structural biology and holds great potential for studying the dynamics of other membrane proteins."

This mutation is thought to promote cancer due to hyperactivation of STAT5B caused by increased stability of the active, parallel dimer state. However, the molecular mechanism leading to this stabilization is not well understood as there is currently no structure of the parallel dimer. To investigate the mutation's mechanism of action, we conducted extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of multiple oligomeric forms of both STAT5B and STAT5B(N642H), including a model for the parallel dimer. The N642H mutation directly affects the hydrogen bonding network within the phosphotyrosine (pY)-binding pocket of the parallel dimer, enhancing the pY-binding interaction. The simulations indicate that apo STAT5B is highly flexible, exploring a diverse conformational space. In contrast, apo STAT5B(N642H) accesses two distinct conformational states, one of which resembles the conformation of the parallel dimer.  The simulation predictions of the effects of the mutation on structure and dynamics are supported by the results of hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry measurements carried out on STAT5B and STAT5B(N642H) in which a phosphopeptide was used to mimic the effects of parallel dimerization on the SH2 domain. The molecular-level information uncovered in this work contributes to our understanding of STAT5B hyperactivation by the N642H mutation and could help pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting this mutation."
Biophysics,Minimal vertex model explains how the amnioserosa avoids fluidization during Drosophila dorsal closure,"Indrajit,Daniel,Janice M.,Daniel P.,Christoph F.,Andrea J.,Indrajit,Daniel,Janice M.,Daniel P.,Christoph F.,Andrea J.,Indrajit,Daniel,Janice M.,Daniel P.,Christoph F.","Dorsal closure is a process that occurs during embryogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster. During dorsal closure, the amnioserosa (AS), a one-cell thick epithelial tissue that fills the dorsal opening, shrinks as the lateral epidermis sheets converge and eventually merge. During this process, both shape index and aspect ratio of amnioserosa cells increase markedly. The standard 2-dimensional vertex model, which successfully describes tissue sheet mechanics in multiple contexts, would in this case predict that the tissue should fluidize via cell neighbor changes. Surprisingly, however, the amnioserosa remains an elastic solid with no such events. We here present a minimal extension to the vertex model that explains how the amnioserosa can achieve this unexpected behavior. We show that continuous shrinkage of the preferred cell perimeter and cell perimeter polydispersity lead to the retention of the solid state of the amnioserosa. Our model accurately captures measured cell shape and orientation changes and predicts non-monotonic junction tension that we confirm with laser ablation experiments."

To overcome this challenge, we engineered a replicating retrovirus (RRV) to deliver a superagonist interleukin-15 receptor-linker fusion protein (RLI) directly to tumor cells, engineering them into local immunotherapy biofactories. This strategy leverages the tumor-selective replication of RRV to achieve localized and sustained RLI expression within the tumor microenvironment. In two orthotopic poorly immunogenic GBM mouse models, intratumoral administration of RRV RLI significantly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival compared to controls, with some mice achieving long-term remission and demonstrating immunological memory upon rechallenge. Transcriptomic and flow cytometric analyses revealed that RRV RLI treatment enhanced infiltration and activation of CD8⁺ T cells and NK cells, and upregulated antigen presentation pathways within the tumor microenvironment. Depletion studies indicated that the therapeutic efficacy of RRV RLI is dependent on both CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells. Notably, combining RRV RLI with the GBM standard of care chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide synergistically improved survival outcomes. Subsequent single-cell RNA and T-cell receptor sequencing identified enhanced effector cell activation, antigen presentation, and clonal T-cell expansion in the combination therapy group. Our findings suggest that RRV-mediated delivery of RLI effectively transforms GBM tumors into immunostimulatory hubs, eliciting potent anti-tumor immune responses. This novel viral immunotherapy holds significant promise for clinical translation in the treatment of GBM and other difficult-to-treat solid tumors."

The rectangular-prism-shaped magnetoelectric nanoparticle is a smart nanoparticle that produces a local electric field in response to an externally applied magnetic field. When externally activated, MENPs are preferentially attracted to the highly conductive cancer cell membranes, which occurs in cancer cells because of dysregulated ion flux across their membranes. In a pancreatic adenocarcinoma murine model, MENPs activated by external magnetic fields during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) resulted in a mean three-fold tumor volume reduction (62.3% vs 188.7%; P < .001) from a single treatment. In a longitudinal confirmatory study, 35% of mice treated with activated MENPs achieved a durable complete response for 14 weeks after one treatment. The degree of tumor volume reduction correlated with a decrease in MRI T2* relaxation time (r = .351; P = .039) which suggests that MENPs have a potential to serve as a predictive nanotheranostic agent at time of treatment.

Biophysics,Bringing Attomolar Detection to the Point-of-Care with Nanopatterned DNA Origami Nanoantennas,"Renukka,Kateryna,Mihir,Vivien,Benedikt,Jan,Cindy,Michael,Giovanni,Leoni,Sophia,Viktorija,Tim,Philip,Renukka,Kateryna,Mihir,Vivien,Benedikt,Jan,Cindy,Michael,Giovanni,Leoni,Sophia,Viktorija,Tim,Philip,Renukka,Kateryna,Mihir,Vivien,Benedikt,Jan,Cindy,Michael,Giovanni,Leoni,Sophia,Viktorija,Tim","Creating increasingly sensitive and cost-effective nucleic acid detection methods is critical for enhancing point-of-care (POC) applications. This involves capturing all desired biomarkers in a sample with high specificity and transducing the capture events to a detector. However, the signal from biomarkers present at extremely low amounts often falls below the detection limit of typical fluorescence-based methods, making molecular amplification a necessary step. Here, we present a nucleic acid detection assay of a 151-nucleotide sequence specific to antibiotics-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, based on single-molecule fluorescence detection of non-amplified DNA down to the attomolar level, using Trident NanoAntennas with Cleared HOtSpots (NACHOS). Our NACHOS-diagnostics assay leverages a compact microscope with a large field-of-view and cost-efficient components, including microfluidic flow to enhance capturing efficiency. Fluorescence enhancement is provided by DNA origami NanoAntennas, arranged in a dense array using a combination of nanosphere lithography and site-specific DNA origami placement. Our method can detect 200 ± 50 out of 600 molecules in a 100 μL sample volume within an hour. This represents typical number of pathogens in clinical samples commonly detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction but without the need for molecular amplification. We achieve similar sensitivity in untreated human blood plasma, enhancing the practical applicability of the system. Our platform can be adapted to detect shorter nucleic acid fragments that are not compatible with traditional amplification-based technologies. This broadens its potential for diverse diagnostic and healthcare applications, providing a robust and scalable solution for sensitive nucleic acid detection in various clinical settings."

Recent studies suggest that the aberrant transition of monomeric aS into solid-like aggregates may occur through an intermediate liquid-like state, where the protein partitions between dense and dilute phases. Although aS is not typically recognized as an RNA-binding protein, it can bind RNA under aggregation conditions, but its impact on aS liquid-like phases remains unexplored. Employing a combination of fluorescence spectroscopy techniques, we investigated aS dynamics in both phases in the presence of RNA. Our analysis revealed the formation of nanoclusters involved in initiating phase separation and uncovered heterogeneity within the dense phase, discovering that aS molecules exist in two distinct mobility states. Additionally, we demonstrated that RNA induces morphological changes and promotes the liquid-to-solid transition of aS dense phase. These findings underscore the active role of RNA in modulating aS phase transitions."
Biophysics,Reliable reconstruction of cricket song from biophysical models and preserved specimens,"Ryan J,Sarah C,Gabriella VS,Nathan W,Natasha,Ryan J,Sarah C,Gabriella VS,Nathan W,Natasha,Ryan J,Sarah C,Gabriella VS,Nathan W","Predicting the function of a biological structure solely from its morphology can be a very powerful tool in several fields of biology, but especially in evolutionary reconstruction. In the field of invertebrate acoustic communication, reconstructing the acoustic properties of sound-producing forewings in crickets has been based on two very divergent methods, finite element modelling (FEM) and vibrometric measurements from preserved specimens. Both methods, however, make strong simplifying assumptions which have not been tested and the reliability of inferences made from either method remains in question. Here we rigorously test and refine both reconstruction methods using the well-known Teleogryllus oceanicus model system and determine the appropriate conditions required to reconstruct the vibroacoustic behaviour of male forewings. We find that when using FEM it is not necessary to assume simplified boundary conditions if the appropriate parameters are found. When using preserved specimens, we find that the sample needs to be rehydrated for reliable reconstruction, however, it may be possible to accomplish rehydration in silico using FEM. Our findings provide a refined methodology for the reliable reconstruction of cricket songs, whether from fossils or preserved specimens from museums or field collections."

There is growing evidence that, in addition to BAK and BAX, lipids play an important role in pore formation. Towards a better understanding of the lipidic drivers of  apoptotic pore formation in isolated mitochondria, two complementary approaches were taken. Firstly, the lipids released during BAK-mediated pore formation were measured with targeted lipidomics, revealing enrichment of long chain polyunsaturated lysophospholipids (LPLs) in the released fraction. In contrast, the BAK protein was not released suggesting that BAK and LPLs locate to distinct microdomains. Secondly, added cholesterol not only prevented pore formation but prevented the clustering of BAK homodimers. Our data lead us to a model in which BAK clustering triggers formation of a separate microdomain rich in LPLs that can progress to lipid shedding and the opening of a lipid-lined pore. Pore stabilisation and growth may be due to BAK dimers then moving to the pore edge. Our BAK-lipid microdomain model supports the heterogeneity of BAK assemblies, and the observed lipid-release signature gives new insight into the genesis of the apoptotic pore."
Cell Biology,Intra-manchette transport employs both microtubule and actin tracks,"Jo,Laura,Tereza,Albert J.R.,Tzviya,Jo,Laura,Tereza,Albert J.R.,Tzviya,Jo,Laura,Tereza,Albert J.R.","The manchette is a transient microtubule based structure that plays a vital role in nuclear shaping during spermiogenesis. It comprises thousands of microtubules (MTs) that build a scaffold around the distal half of the nucleus. The manchette distributes proteins and vesicles during spermiogenesis in a process called intra-manchette transport (IMT). The current hypothesis is that IMT shares many similarities with intra-flagellar transport (IFT) and utilizes both MTs and filamentous actin (F-actin). However, IMT is still poorly understood as direct visualization of IMT complexes is missing, and the presence of F-actin has not been experimentally shown. Here, we use proteomics and cryogenic-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to identify and visualize IMT components. We find that F-actin is an integral part of the manchette with two different spatial organizations, namely bundles and single filaments, providing tracks for transport as well as having structural and mechanical roles. We further uncover that IMT on MTs is mediated by two distinct transport machineries: dynein mediated transport of soluble cargo and dynein independent transport for vesicles. Our results provide new insights into the manchette's function as a transport scaffold, highlighting its significance for the polarization of spermatids during spermiogenesis."

However, information in more complex samples, such as tissues, is lacking. Importantly, these observations need to be set in context of populations; imaging on the molecular scale to-date is limited to few observations in-situ that struggle to be generalised. This is due to limitations in throughput and versatility employed by current instrumentation. Here, we utilise plasma focused ion beam milling to examine the molecular landscape of mouse hippocampus by cryoET in targeted regions across multiple individuals revealing the complex organisation of macromolecules from the CA1 strata pyramidale (sp) to radiatum (sr).

Biochemistry,Recognition and Cleavage of Human tRNA Methyltransferase TRMT1 by the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease,"Angel,Xuhang,Saba,Sophie,Evan P,Lucie,Yingkai,Jeffrey S,Angel,Xuhang,Saba,Sophie,Evan P,Lucie,Yingkai,Jeffrey S,Angel,Xuhang,Saba,Sophie,Evan P,Lucie,Yingkai","The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro, or Nsp5) is critical for the production of functional viral proteins during infection and, like many viral proteases, can also target host proteins to subvert their cellular functions. Here, we show that the human tRNA methyltransferase TRMT1 can be recognized and cleaved by SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. TRMT1 installs the N2,N2-dimethylguanosine (m2,2G) modification on mammalian tRNAs, which promotes global protein synthesis and cellular redox homeostasis. We find that Mpro can cleave endogenous TRMT1 in human cell lysate, resulting in removal of the TRMT1 zinc finger domain. TRMT1 proteolysis results in elimination of TRMT1 tRNA methyltransferase activity and reduced tRNA binding affinity. Evolutionary analysis shows that the TRMT1 cleavage site is highly conserved in mammals, except in Muroidea, where TRMT1 is likely resistant to cleavage. In primates, regions outside the cleavage site with rapid evolution could indicate adaptation to ancient viral pathogens.  Furthermore, we determined the structure of a TRMT1 peptide in complex with Mpro, revealing a substrate binding conformation distinct from the majority of available Mpro-peptide complexes. Kinetic parameters for peptide cleavage show that the TRMT1(526-536) sequence is cleaved with comparable efficiency to the Mpro-targeted nsp8/9 viral cleavage site. Mutagenesis studies and molecular dynamics simulations together indicate that kinetic discrimination occurs during a later step of Mpro-mediated proteolysis that follows substrate binding. Our results provide new information about the structural basis for Mpro substrate recognition and cleavage, the functional roles of the TRMT1 zinc finger domain in tRNA binding and modification, and the regulation of TRMT1 activity by SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. These studies could inform future therapeutic design targeting Mpro and raise the possibility that proteolysis of human TRMT1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection suppresses protein translation and oxidative stress response to impact viral pathogenesis."

Cell Biology,Comprehensive identification of plasma membrane repair proteins revealed spatiotemporal cellular responses to plasma membrane damage,"Yuta,Keiko,Yuta,Keiko,Yuta","Damage to the plasma membrane (PM) is common in all types of cells. PM repair processes, including exocytosis and endocytosis, are not mutually exclusive; rather, they collaborate to repair the wound. However, the temporal coordination between the repair processes remains poorly understood. Here, by comprehensively identifying PM repair proteins, we resolved the temporal PM repair processes at the damage site in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Of the 80 repair proteins identified, 72 proteins were previously unreported repair protein candidates. We showed that polarity establishment, polarized exocytosis, and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) occur in a specific temporal order at the damage site. Furthermore, we showed that polarized exocytosis and CME are coupled at the damage site, delivering PM repair proteins with transmembrane domains between the growing bud site and the damage site. This study provides insights into the temporal dynamics of coordinated cellular response to PM damage."

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the SSRI citalopram combined with part-time patching of the fellow fixing eye would improve amblyopic eye visual acuity in adult humans. Following a cross-over, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled design (pre-registration: ACTRN12611000669998), participants completed two 2-week blocks of fellow fixing eye patching. One block combined patching with citalopram (20 mg/day) and the other with a placebo tablet. The blocks were separated by a 2-week washout period. The primary outcome was change in amblyopic eye visual acuity. Secondary outcomes included stereoacuity and electrophysiological measures of retinal and cortical function. Seven participants were randomized, fewer than our pre-specified sample size of 20. There were no statistically significant differences in amblyopic eye visual acuity change between the active (mean ± SD change = 0.08±0.16 logMAR) and the placebo (mean change = −0.01±0.03 logMAR) blocks. No treatment effects were observed for any secondary outcomes. However, 3 of 7 participants experienced a 0.1 logMAR or greater improvement in amblyopic eye visual acuity in the active but not the placebo block. These results from a small sample suggest that larger-scale trials of SSRI treatment for adult amblyopia may be warranted. Considerations for future trials include drug dose, treatment duration and recruitment challenges."

To overcome these limitations, we developed ATENA (Approach to Target Exact Nucleic Acid alternative structures). ATENA relies on the chemical modification of established G4-ligands to enable their conjugation onto a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein (dCas9) using HaloTag, allowing for the targeting of individual G4s in living cells.

Bioinformatics,BIMSA: Accelerating Long Sequence Alignment Using Processing-In-Memory,"Alejandro,Ivan,Quim,Juan,Santiago,Onur,Miquel,Alejandro,Ivan,Quim,Juan,Santiago,Onur,Miquel,Alejandro,Ivan,Quim,Juan,Santiago,Onur","Motivation: Recent advances in sequencing technologies have stressed the critical role of sequence analysis algorithms and tools in genomics and healthcare research. In particular, sequence alignment is a fundamental building block in many sequence analysis pipelines and is frequently a performance-critical bottleneck both in time and memory. Classical sequence alignment algorithms are based on dynamic programming and often require quadratic time and memory with respect to the sequence length. As a result, classic sequence alignment algorithms fail to scale with increasing sequence lengths and quickly become memory-bound due to data-movement penalties. Results: Processing-In-Memory (PIM) is an emerging architectural paradigm that seeks to accelerate memory-bound algorithms by bringing computation closer to the data to mitigate data-movement penalties. This work presents BIMSA (Bidirectional In-Memory Sequence Alignment), a PIM-optimized implementation of the state-of-the-art sequence alignment algorithm BiWFA (Bidirectional Wavefront Alignment), incorporating hardware-aware optimizations for a production-ready PIM architecture (UPMEM). BIMSA achieves speedups up to 22.24x (11.95x on average) compared to state-of-the-art PIM-enabled implementations of sequence alignment algorithms, and supports aligning sequences of thousands of bases, exceeding the limitations of current PIM-accelerated implementations. BIMSA also achieves speedups up to 5.84x (2.83x on average) compared to the most efficient multicore CPU implementation of BiWFA. Most notably, BIMSA exhibits linear scalability with the number of compute units, enabling further performance improvements with upcoming PIM architectures equipped with more compute units and achieving speedups up to 9.56x (4.7x on average)."

Jeroen,Leonard,Johnathan,Jan","Explaining missing heritability in rare disorders requires effective methods to interpret genetic variants. Sequence-to-function models such as SpliceAI support discovery of splice altering variants but filtering their output to identify pathogenic mutations remains challenging. We developed SpliPath to address 2 unmet needs in this process. First, SpliPath links the output of SpliceAI with reference transcriptomics data. This allows users to identify genetic variants that induce unannotated splice isoforms selectively expressed in disease models or patient tissue. Second, SpliPath aggregates variants with similar functional consequences into collapsed splicing quantitative trait loci (csQTLs) for more powerful genetic association analyses. We first used SpliPath to annotate whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 9,467 ALS patients and controls using RNAseq data from an iPSC model of TDP-43 dysfunction. Through this, SpliPath identified 53 variants predicted to enhance cryptic exon (CE) retention events associated with a core ALS pathomechanism. We then applied SpliPath to 294 ALS patients where both WGS and RNAseq were available and discovered missing genetic risk in the known ALS gene KIF5A. This revealed a first of kind intronic mutation hotspot that was validated using minigene reporter assays. Finally, using the same RNAseq data we then predicted 754 candidate csQTL for an independent WGS cohort of 6,625 ALS patients and 2,472 controls. Unbiased genomewide csQTL association testing successfully recovered KIF5A and nominated EPG5 as a potential pathogenic gene. These effects were undetectable using simplistic SpliceAI gene burden tests. Collectively, our study demonstrates the utility of SpliPath for uncovering missing heritability in rare disorders."

Many materials reside in public Git repositories that are hosted on platforms such as GitHub and GitLab. Glittr.org is a manually curated database of Git repositories, which enables users to find educational materials that would otherwise be hard to identify. With the application, users can search and compare educational materials based on topic and author, but also on engagement metrics such as stargazers (bookmarks) and recency (days since last commit). Glittr.org currently contains 664 entries, which are assigned to six different categories within the domain of computational life sciences. By analysing the database, we reveal insights in the availability of materials per topic, collaboration patterns of developers, and licensing practices. This knowledge helps to understand in which areas open educational materials are scant, the importance of Git for collaboration on educational materials and how licensing can be improved to enhance sharing and reuse. Taken together, we show that Glittr.org contains a wealth of connected and openly available metadata. Therefore, it enhances adherence to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, which benefits learners, teachers and trainers in the entire life sciences community and beyond."
Bioinformatics,A uniﬁed framework for drug-target interaction prediction by semantic-guided meta-path method,"Haoyuan,Jianxin,Haochen,Kai,Qichang,Haoyuan,Jianxin,Haochen,Kai,Qichang,Haoyuan,Jianxin,Haochen,Kai","Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction plays a crucial role in drug development, impacting areas such as virtual screening, drug repurposing, and the identification of potential drug side effects. Despite significant efforts dedicated to improving DTI prediction, existing methods still struggle with the challenges posed by the high sparsity of DTI datasets and the complexity of capturing heterogeneous information in biological networks.
To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework for DTI prediction based on a semantics-guided meta-path walk. Specifically, we first pre-train drug and protein embeddings to capture their semantic information. This semantic information is then leveraged to guide a meta-path-based random walk on the biological heterogeneous network, generating sequences of interactions. These sequences are used to compute embedding features via a heterogeneous skip-gram model, which are subsequently fed into downstream tasks to predict DTIs.
SGMDTI achieves substantial performance improvement over other state-of-the-art methods for drug-target interaction prediction. Moreover, it excels in the cold-start scenario, which is often a challenging case in DTI prediction. These results indicate the effectiveness of our approach in predicting drug-target interactions.Experimental datasets and experimental codes can be found in https://github.com/HYLPRC/SGMDTI."

However, selecting the right protein fragments as immunogens for antibody production remains challenging. Leveraging the Human Protein Atlas, this study systematically evaluates immunogen properties aiming to identify key factors that influence their suitability. Antibodies were classified as successful or unsuccessful based on standardized validation experiments, and the structural and functional properties of their immunogens were analysed. Results indicated that longer immunogens often resulted in more successful but less specific antibodies. Shorter immunogens (50 residues or fewer) with disordered or unfolded regions at the N- or C-terminus and long coil stretches were more likely to generate successful antibodies. Conversely, immunogens with high beta sheet content, multiple secondary structure elements, transmembrane regions, or disulfide bridges were associated with poorer antibody performance. Post-translational modification sites within immunogens appeared to mark beneficial regions for antibody generation. To support antibody selection, a novel R package, immunogenViewer, was developed, enabling researchers to easily apply these insights when immunogen sequences are disclosed. By providing a deeper understanding of immunogen suitability, this study promotes the development of more effective antibodies, ultimately addressing issues of reproducibility and reliability in antibody-based research. The findings are highly relevant to the research community, as end-users often lack control over the immunogen selection process in antibody production."

Sulfation is near-isobaric to phosphorylation, making it particularly challenging to investigate using mass spectrometry. The degree to which tyrosine sulfation (sY) is misidentified as phosphorylation (pY) is thus an unresolved concern. This study explores the extent of sY misidentification within the human phosphoproteome by distinguishing between sulfation and phosphorylation based on their mass difference. Using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), we screened ~45M peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) from the PeptideAtlas Human Phosphoproteome build for peptidoforms with mass error shifts indicative of sulfation. This analysis pinpointed 104 candidate sulfated peptidoforms, backed-up by Gene Ontology (GO) terms and custom terms linked to sulfation. False positive filtering by manual annotation resulted in 31 convincing peptidoforms spanning 7 known and 7 novel sY sites. Y47 in Calumenin was particularly intriguing since mass error shifts, acidic motif conservation, and MS2 neutral loss patterns characteristic of sulfation, but not phosphorylation, provided strong evidence that this site can only be sulfated. Overall, although misidentification of sulfation in phosphoproteomics datasets derived from cell and tissue intracellular extracts can occur, it appears relatively rare and should not be considered a confounding factor for high-quality phosphoproteomics studies."

As DNA polymerases progress, negative supercoils accumulate in the wake of the replication fork, thereby impeding fork progression unless the supercoils are resolved topologically. Using super-resolution microscopy combined with spatial distribution analysis, here we describe that SMC5/6-mediated confinement of negative supercoils lies at the basis of releasing them by topoisomerase Top2A. Along with DNA replication, SMC5/6 progressively associates with chromatin and locally increases the density of supercoil clusters behind the fork, allowing Top2A to efficiently target and release the accumulated supercoils. These processes are essential to complete DNA replication prior to mitosis and therefore to ensure genome stability. Remarkably, we found that HeLa cells over-accumulate poorly confined negative supercoils beyond the processing capacity of cellular SMC5/6, which may exemplify the condition associated with genome instability of cancer cells."

Ceftazidime combined with the β-lactamase inhibitor avibactam (CAZ-AVI) has been effective for treating infections by KPC-producing bacteria, but emergent KPC variants confer resistance to the combination. Taniborbactam and ledaborbactam are bicyclic boronate β-lactamase inhibitors under development with cefepime and ceftibuten, respectively, to treat carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections.

Biochemistry,Phosphoproteomics highlights complex resource management upon inflammatory stimulation of fibroblasts,"Patricia,Ana,Gerhard,Lukas,Jesper V.,Christopher,Patricia,Ana,Gerhard,Lukas,Jesper V.,Christopher,Patricia,Ana,Gerhard,Lukas,Jesper V.","The stimulation of cells by inflammatory mediators gives rise to intricate signaling cascades, inducing specific biological functions. The role of kinase activation for the establishment of specific inflammatory functions has only scarcely been established. A time-course analysis of human fetal fibroblasts stimulated with Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and/or Dexamethasone (Dex) was conducted using mass spectrometry-based proteomics and phosphoproteomics in conjunction with lysolipid and oxylipin profiling. The IL-1β induced proteome alterations indicated metabolic, transcriptional, and translational activation, including inflammatory marker proteins such as NOS1, THBS1, and STING1. The induction of mitochondrial proteins and the formation of numerous lysolipids indicated an increase in beta-oxidation. In addition to the NF-κB and STAT signaling pathways, which are characteristic of inflammatory activation, the MAP and AKT kinase signaling pathways were found to be strongly induced. Six hours after treatment, the observed signaling events exhibited a notable decline, nearly returning to their initial states after 24 hours. It is noteworthy that nearly all of these signaling activities were also observed in cells treated with Dex alone. Additionally, the proteome exhibited transient alterations, which included proteins otherwise characteristic of an inflammatory response, such as MMP3 and NFKB2. Activation of the kinase PIKFYVE was apparently specific for dexamethasone but constituted a minority of the total phosphorylation events. Only after 24 hours was the induction of proteins characteristic of glucocorticoids, such as TSC22D3 and MAOA, observed. The analysis of the effects of dexamethasone on the background of established inflammatory signaling verified the known inhibitory functions and resulted in the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins and oxylipins, but hardly affected the signaling events involving MAP and AKT kinases. In conclusion, this data demonstrates that a majority of inflammation-associated signaling events in fibroblasts needs to be attributed to resource and stress management rather than the establishment of specific inflammatory effector functions."

Bioinformatics,NeKo: a tool for automatic network construction from prior knowledge,"Marco,Eirini,Andrea,Denes,Emmanuel,Julio,Loredana,Åsmund,Laurence,Marco,Eirini,Andrea,Denes,Emmanuel,Julio,Loredana,Åsmund,Laurence,Marco,Eirini,Andrea,Denes,Emmanuel,Julio,Loredana,Åsmund","Biological networks provide a structured framework for analyzing the dynamic interplay and interactions between molecular entities, facilitating deeper insights into cellular functions and biological processes. Network construction often requires extensive manual curation based on scientific literature and public databases, a time-consuming and laborious task. To address this challenge, we introduce NeKo, a Python package to automate the construction of biological networks by integrating and prioritizing molecular interactions from various databases. NeKo allows users to provide their molecules of interest (e.g., genes, proteins or phosphosites), select interaction resources and apply flexible strategies to build networks based on prior knowledge. Users can filter interactions by various criteria, such as direct or indirect links and signed or unsigned interactions, to tailor the network to their needs and downstream analysis. We demonstrate some of NeKo's capabilities in two use cases: first we construct a network based on transcriptomics from medulloblastoma; in the second, we model drug synergies. NeKo streamlines the network-building process, making it more accessible and efficient for researchers. The tool is available at https://sysbio-curie.github.io/Neko/."

In this investigation, we aimed to identify diagnostic markers and analyzed the therapeutic potential of essential genes.  Next generation sequencing (NGS) dataset GSE180313 was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HCM. DEGs were screened using the DESeq2 Rbioconductor tool. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) and REACTOME pathway enrichment analyses were performed. Moreover, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs was constructed, and module analysis was performed. Next, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network were constructed and analyzed. Finally, diagnostic values of hub genes were assessed by  by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. By performing DEGs analysis, total 958 DEGs ( 479 up regulated genes and 479 down regulated genes) were successfully identified from GSE180313, respectively. GO and REACTOME pathway enrichment analyses revealed that GO functions  and signaling pathways were significantly enriched including response to stimulus, multicellular organismal process, metabolism and extracellular matrix organization. The hub genes of FN1, SOX2, TUBA4A, RPS2, TUBA1C, ESR1, SNCA, LCK, PAK1 and APLNR might be associated with HCM.  The hub gens of FN1 and TPM3, together with corresponding predicted miRNAs (e.g., hsa-mir-374a-5p and hsa-miR-8052), and SH3KBP1 and ESR1 together with corresponding predicted TFs (e.g PRRX2 and STAT3) were found to be significantly correlated with HCM. This investigation could serve as a basis for further understanding the molecular pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets of HCM."
Bioinformatics,MSFragger-DDA+ Enhances Peptide Identification Sensitivity with Full Isolation Window Search,"Fengchao,Yamei,Alexey,Fengchao,Yamei,Alexey,Fengchao,Yamei","Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based proteomics, particularly in the bottom-up approach, relies on the digestion of proteins into peptides for subsequent separation and analysis. The most prevalent method for identifying peptides from data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry data is database search. Traditional tools typically focus on identifying a single peptide per tandem mass spectrum (MS2), often neglecting the frequent occurrence of peptide co-fragmentations leading to chimeric spectra. Here, we introduce MSFragger-DDA+, a novel database search algorithm that enhances peptide identification by detecting co-fragmented peptides with high sensitivity and speed. Utilizing MSFragger's fragment ion indexing algorithm, MSFragger-DDA+ performs a comprehensive search within the full isolation window for each MS2, followed by robust feature detection, filtering, and rescoring procedures to refine search results. Evaluation against established tools across diverse datasets demonstrated that, integrated within the FragPipe computational platform, MSFragger-DDA+ significantly increases identification sensitivity while maintaining stringent false discovery rate (FDR) control. It is also uniquely suited for wide-window acquisition (WWA) data. MSFragger-DDA+ provides an efficient and accurate solution for peptide identification, enhancing the detection of low-abundance co-fragmented peptides. Coupled with the FragPipe platform, MSFragger-DDA+ enables more comprehensive and accurate analysis of proteomics data."
Biochemistry,Assessment of a high-throughput mass spectrometry method to accelerate biomarker discovery in clinical cancer cohorts using volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) devices,"N.,C.,D.,R.,B.,E.,N.,C.,D.,R.,B.,E.,N.,C.,D.,R.,B.","Identification of biomarkers of early-stage disease typically requires analysis of very large cohorts which can only be reasonably achieved using high-throughput methods. We have developed and optimised novel methods for whole blood analysis using volumetric absorptive microsampling devices to produce over 3000 protein identifications by LCMS on a Q Exactive HF-X Orbitrap. These methods were tested using a set of whole blood samples from lung cancer patients and matching healthy controls finding 455 differentially expressed proteins, using a mid-throughput method enabling analysis of 18 samples per day. To increase throughput for larger clinical cohorts, a 60-sample per day method was tested on a Sciex ZenoTOF 7600. The high-throughput method produced 1.5-fold fewer protein identifications and a higher overall % CV compared to the mid-throughput method. Despite the lower numbers, it produced a set of 36 disease-relevant and discriminatory differentially expressed proteins that, using a machine learning model, could differentiate between the disease and control samples with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 88.9% using random forest algorithms. These data support the use of high-throughput mass spectrometry methods to screen large cohorts for diagnostic biomarkers that can then be followed up with more targeted analyses."
Bioinformatics,Single-cell dynamics reveal a stress-induced decision between cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis,"Bryan,Lavie,Jeffrey J,Bryan,Lavie,Jeffrey J,Bryan,Lavie","Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis underlie cardiomyopathies and heart failure. While previous studies have described hypertrophy or apoptosis at the level of cell populations, how individual cells commit to these distinct yet co-regulated fates is unclear. We developed a high-content microscopy approach to track single-cell hypertrophy and apoptosis dynamics, revealing new features and unique subpopulation responses. The catecholamine isoproterenol induced both analog hypertrophy and digital apoptosis. While high-dose isoproterenol induced mixed hypertrophy and apoptosis at the population level, we found that individual cells that hypertrophy are more likely to survive. Likewise, phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy was associated with survival at the single-cell level.  Inhibiting caspase-3 reduced apoptosis and increased a cell likelihood of hypertrophy. Multinomial log-linear models demonstrate that a cell initial size and DNA content predict its susceptibility to hypertrophy or apoptosis. These data support a grow-or-die conceptual model for cardiomyocyte decisions. This work develops a single-cell profiling method to reveal that while hypertrophy and apoptosis often coincide at the population level, single cells that hypertrophy are protected from death."
Bioinformatics,Limitations of Current Machine-Learning Models in Predicting Enzymatic Functions for Uncharacterized Proteins,"Valerie,Raquel,Iddo,Yifeng,Manal,Valerie,Raquel,Iddo,Yifeng,Manal,Valerie,Raquel,Iddo,Yifeng","Thirty to seventy percent of proteins in any given genome have no assigned function and have been labeled as the protein unknownme. This large knowledge gap prevents the biological community from fully leveraging the plethora of genomic data that is now available. Machine-learning approaches are showing some promise in propagating functional knowledge from experimentally characterized proteins to the correct set of isofunctional orthologs. However, they largely fail to predict enzymatic functions unseen in the training set, as shown by dissecting the predictions made for 450 enzymes of unknown function from the model bacteria Escherichia coli using the DeepECTransformer platform. Lessons from these failures can help the community develop machine-learning methods that assist domain experts in making testable functional predictions for more members of the uncharacterized proteome."

However, in practical analysis of complex biological system, the majority of compounds often remain unidentified. Here, we developed a novel deep learning-based compound annotation approach via semantic similarity analysis of mass spectral language. This approach enables the prediction of structurally related compounds for unknowns. By considering the chemical space, these structurally related compounds provide valuable information about the potential location of the unknown compounds and assist in ranking candidates obtained from molecular structure databases. Validated with two independent benchmark datasets obtained by chemical standards, our method has consistently demonstrated superior performance compared to existing compound annotation methods. A case study of the tomato ripening process indicates that DeepMASS has significant potential for metabolic biomarker identification in real biological systems. Overall, the presented method shows considerable promise in annotating metabolites, particularly in revealing the ""dark matter"" in untargeted analysis."
Bioinformatics,Improved gene regulatory network inference from single cell data with dropout augmentation,"Hao,Donna,Hao,Donna,Hao","A major challenge in working with single-cell RNA sequencing data is the prevalence of ""dropout"", when some transcripts' expression values are erroneously not captured. Addressing this issue, which produces zero-inflated count data, is crucial for many downstream data analyses including the inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). In this paper, we introduce two novel contributions. First, we propose Dropout Augmentation (DA), a simple but effective model regularization method to address the zero inflation problem in single-cell data by augmenting the data with synthetic dropout events. DA offers a new perspective to solve the ""dropout"" problem beyond imputation. Second, we present DAZZLE, a stabilized and robust version of the autoencoder-based structure equation model for GRN inference using the DA concept. Benchmark experiments illustrate the improved performance and increased stability of the proposed DAZZLE model over existing approaches. The practical application of the DAZZLE model on a longitudinal mouse microglia dataset containing over 15,000 genes illustrates its ability to handle real-world single cell data with minimal gene filtration. The improved robustness and stability of DAZZLE make it a practical and valuable addition to the toolkit for GRN inference from single-cell data. Finally, we propose that Dropout Augmentation may have wider applications beyond the GRN-inference problem.  Project website: https://bcb.cs.tufts.edu/DAZZLE."
Bioinformatics,Telomere-to-Telomere Phased Genome Assembly Using HERRO-Corrected Simplex Nanopore Reads,"Dominik,Dehui,Sergey,Paola,Mile,Dominik,Dehui,Sergey,Paola,Mile,Dominik,Dehui,Sergey,Paola","Telomere-to-telomere phased assemblies have become the norm in genomics. To achieve these for diploid and even polyploid genomes, the contemporary approach involves a combination of two long-read sequencing technologies: high-accuracy long reads, e.g. Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi or Oxford Nanopore (ONT) 'Duplex' reads, and ultra-long ONT 'Simplex' reads. Using two different technologies increases the cost and the required amount of genomic DNA. Here, we show that comparable results are possible using error correction of ultra-long ONT Simplex reads and then assembling them using state-of-the-art de novo assembly methods. To achieve this, we have developed the deep learning-based HERRO framework, which corrects ONT Simplex reads while carefully preserving differences in related genomic sequences. Taking into account informative positions that differentiate the haplotypes or genomic repeat copies, HERRO achieves an increase of read accuracy of up to 100-fold for diploid human genomes. By combining HERRO with Verkko assembler, we achieve high contiguity on several human genomes by reconstructing many chromosomes telomere-to-telomere, including chromosomes X and Y. HERRO supports both R9.4.1 and R10.4.1 ONT Simplex reads and generalizes well to other species. These results provide an opportunity to reduce the cost of genome sequencing and use corrected ONT reads to analyze more complex genomes with different levels of ploidy or even aneuploidy."

Their usefulness, however, is dependent on their applicability to diverse ethnoracial groups. With this in mind, we developed age- and sex-specific normative models for cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical volumes using brain scans from 37,407 healthy individuals from a diverse international sample. Here we demonstrate the validity of these models in diverse and distinct populations. Specifically, we tested these pre-trained models on independent samples of healthy individuals that either self-identified as Black, South Asian, East Asian Chinese, East Asian Japanese, or we categorized as African, Admixed American, East Asian, and European based on their genetic ancestry. Regardless of ethnoracial definition, the performance of the pretrained models in these samples was exceptionally high; the relative mean absolute error for each regional brain morphometry measure was less than 10% across all the distinct ethnoracial groups. These findings affirm the broad applicability of our models, ensuring that brain morphometry assessments using these models are accurate and reliable for individuals regardless of background. This broad applicability has significant implications for advancing personalized medicine and improving health outcomes in diverse populations."

However, creating an efficient gene-editing system requires a deep understanding of CRISPR technology, and the complex experimental systems under investigation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, they often lack specific knowledge and struggle to accurately solve biological design problems. In this work, we introduce CRISPR-GPT, an LLM agent augmented with domain knowledge and external tools to automate and enhance the design process of CRISPR-based gene-editing experiments. CRISPR-GPT leverages the reasoning ability of LLMs to facilitate the process of selecting CRISPR systems, designing guide RNAs, recommending cellular delivery methods, drafting protocols, and designing validation experiments to confirm editing outcomes. We showcase the potential of CRISPR-GPT for assisting non-expert researchers with gene-editing experiments from scratch and validate the agent's effectiveness in a real-world use case. Furthermore, we explore the ethical and regulatory considerations associated with automated gene-editing design, highlighting the need for responsible and transparent use of these tools. Our work aims to bridge the gap between biological researchers across various fields with CRISPR genome engineering technology and demonstrate the potential of LLM agents in facilitating complex biological discovery tasks."

We design protein building blocks with regular coordination geometries and bonding interactions that enable the assembly of a wide variety of closed and opened nanomaterials using simple geometrical principles. Experimental characterization confirms successful formation of more than twenty multi-component polyhedral protein cages, 2D arrays, and 3D protein lattices, with a high (10-50 %) success rate and electron microscopy data closely matching the corresponding design models. Because of the modularity, individual building blocks can assemble with different partners to generate distinct regular assemblies, resulting in an economy of parts and enabling the construction of reconfigurable systems."

Here we show that RFdiffusion can be conditioned to efficiently generate protein scaffolds that form geometrically matched extended beta-sheets with target protein edge beta-strands in which polar groups on the target are nearly perfectly complemented with hydrogen bonding groups on the design. We use this approach to design binders against a set of therapeutically relevant polar targets (KIT, PDGFRɑ, ALK-2, ALK-3, FCRL5, and NRP1) and find that beta-strand-targeted design yields higher affinities and success rates than unconditioned RFdiffusion. All by all binding experiments show that the designs have affinities ranging from 76 pM to mid nM for their targets and essentially no off target binding despite the sharing of beta-strand interactions, likely reflecting the precise customization of interacting beta-strand geometry and additional designed binder-target interactions. A co-crystal structure of one such design in complex with the KIT receptor is nearly identical to the computational design model confirming the accuracy of the design approach. The ability to robustly generate binders displaying high affinity and specificity to polar interaction surfaces with exposed beta-strands considerably increases the range and capabilities of computational binder design."

RNA polymerase ribozymes could constitute such a system, but their large size and structural complexity hinder their self-replication and make their spontaneous emergence improbable. Here we describe QT45: a 45-nucleotide ribozyme, discovered from a random sequence pool, that catalyzes general RNA-templated RNA synthesis using trinucleotide triphosphate substrates. QT45 can synthesize both its complementary strand from a mix of all 64 trinucleotides and a copy of itself using 13 defined trinucleotides and one hexamer as substrates. The discovery of this complex activity in a small ribozyme suggests that polymerase ribozymes may be more abundant in RNA sequence space than anticipated, thereby facilitating the emergence of self-replication."

EED is a condition that drives childhood stunting via intestinal dysbiosis and impaired nutrient metabolism. This study investigated effects of rice bran supplementation on growth, EED biomarkers, gut microbiome and metabolome in weaning infants from 6 to 12 months old in Nicaragua and Mali. Healthy infants were randomized to a control group or rice bran group that received daily supplementation at increasing doses each month. Stool microbiomes were characterized using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Stool metabolomes were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry. Statistical comparisons were completed at 6, 8, and 12 months of age. Daily consumption of rice bran was safe and feasible for infant growth, decreasing alpha-1 antitrypsin levels, and modulating gut microbiome and metabolome when compared to control. Rice bran merits investigation as a practical intervention strategy that could decrease EED prevalence and risk for children from low- and middle-income countries where rice is grown as a staple food, and bran is used as animal feed or wasted."

Training that targets recognition of low intensity emotional expressions may therefore be effective as an intervention to improve social-emotional skills. This paper reports the results of two randomised controlled experiments looking at the effect of a training methodology designed to increase the recognition of happy emotion in low intensity happy facial expressions. The first study implements this training with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD, N = 14) and the second study implements this training with adults with ASD (N = 27). The training paradigm used images from a morph sequence that mixed a happy expression with a mixed-emotion ‘norm’ expression to create a sequence of varying intensity happy expressions. Participants were asked to say whether or not individual faces from the sequence were happy, to measure their happiness detection threshold. Participants that received active training were given biased feedback to shift their detection threshold, while participants that received control training were given feedback consistent with their baseline threshold. There was some statistical evidence that thresholds in the active training group shifted more than in the control group. This suggests training was successful in increasing the number of expressions that individuals identified as happy. However, there was no evidence that training increased facial expression recognition accuracy, as measured by the Reading the Mind in the Eyes task completed after training (Study 2)."

Distinctively, kinesin-2s canonically function as heterotrimers of two different motor subunits (e.g. Kif3A and Kif3B) and Kap3, but the role of heterotrimerization has yet to fully emerge. Here, we combine structural, cell biological, and single-molecule approaches to dissect kinesin-2 regulation as a heterodimer, heterotrimer, and quaternary complex with a cargo adaptor (APC). We identify a conserved motif in the tail of kinesin-2s (the beta-hairpin motif) that controls kinesin-2 motility by sequestering the motor domains away from their microtubule track, using striking molecular mimicry. Our data reveal how Kap3 binds via a multipartite interface with Kif3A and Kif3B, and – rather than activating motility directly – provides a platform on which cargo adaptors can engage and occlude the beta-hairpin motif. Together, these data articulate a structural framework for kinesin-2 activation, coordination with dynein, and adaptation for different biological functions."

Summary answer: Inhibition of CFTR dehydrates and thickens in vitro endocervical secretions. 
What is known already: Cervical mucus changes throughout the menstrual cycle in response to hormonal fluctuations, helping to regulate fertility and access of pathogens to the reproductive tract. CFTR is an anion channel that plays a critical role in mediating epithelial mucus secretions. 
Study design, size, duration:  In vitro experiments conducted with control and experimental arms.
Participants/materials, setting, methods: Primary endocervical cells obtained from rhesus macaques Macaca mulatta were treated with vehicle controls or CFTR inhibitor Inh-172. Hydration and viscosity of secreted mucus was measured through air surface liquid and particle tracking microrheology. 
Main results and the role of chance: Endocervical cells treated with CFTR inhibitor Inh-172 demonstrated dehydrated, thicker mucus secretions compared to control (p<.01).  
Limitations, reasons for caution: In vitro models do not fully recapitulate cellular mucus secretions. 
Wider implications of the findings: Cervical mucus plays an important role in fertility regulation. Our studies suggest that CFTR may be an important mediator of those changes and provide experimental evidence for the infertility phenotype seen in women with cystic fibrosis. Additionally, assays used in these studies are useful endpoints for studying cervical mucus regulation in vitro."

To tackle this problem, we use epigenomic and transcriptomic data from 13 ENCODE cell types to train machine learning models to predict gene expression from histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), achieving transcriptome-wide correlations of ~0.70-0.79 for most cell types. Our models recapitulate known associations between histone PTMs and expression patterns, including predicting that acetylation of histone subunit H3 lysine residue 27 (H3K27ac) near the transcription start site (TSS) significantly increases expression levels. To validate this prediction experimentally and investigate how natural vs. engineered deposition of H3K27ac might differentially affect expression, we apply the synthetic dCas9-p300 histone acetyltransferase system to 8 genes in the HEK293T cell line and to 5 genes in the K562 cell line. Further, to facilitate model building, we perform MNase-seq to map genome-wide nucleosome occupancy levels in HEK293T. We observe that our models perform well in accurately ranking relative fold-changes among genes in response to the dCas9-p300 system; however, their ability to rank fold-changes within individual genes is noticeably diminished compared to predicting expression across cell types from their native epigenetic signatures. Our findings highlight the need for more comprehensive genome-scale epigenome editing datasets, better understanding of the actual modifications made by epigenome editing tools, and improved causal models that transfer better from endogenous cellular measurements to perturbation experiments. Together these improvements would facilitate the ability to understand and predictably control the dynamic human epigenome with consequences for human health."
Cell Biology,Multiplexed single-cell imaging reveals diverging subpopulations with distinct senescence phenotypes during long-term senescence induction.,"Garrett A,Madeline V,Brian O'Callaghan,Jeremy E,Garrett A,Madeline V,Brian O'Callaghan,Jeremy E,Garrett A,Madeline V,Brian O'Callaghan","Cellular senescence is a phenotypic state that contributes to the progression of age-related disease through secretion of pro-inflammatory factors known as the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Understanding the process by which healthy cells become senescent and develop SASP factors is critical for improving the identification of senescent cells and, ultimately, understanding tissue dysfunction. Here, we reveal how the duration of cellular stress modulates the SASP in distinct subpopulations of senescent cells. We used multiplex, single-cell imaging to build a proteomic map of senescence induction in human epithelial cells induced to senescence over the course of 31 days. We map how the expression of SASP proteins increases alongside other known senescence markers such as p53, p21, and p16INK4a. The aggregated population of cells responded to etoposide with an accumulation of stress response factors over the first 11 days, followed by a plateau in most proteins. At the single-cell level, however, we identified two distinct senescence cell populations, one defined primarily by larger nuclear area and the second by higher protein concentrations. Trajectory inference suggested that cells took one of two discrete molecular paths from unperturbed healthy cells, through a common transitional subpopulation, and ending at the discrete terminal senescence phenotypes. Our results underscore the importance of using single-cell proteomics to identify the mechanistic pathways governing the transition from senescence induction to a mature state of senescence characterized by the SASP."
Clinical Trials,Human extinction learning is accelerated by an angiotensin antagonist via ventromedial prefrontal cortex and its connections with basolateral amygdala,"Feng,Yayuan,Fei,Jialin,Pan,Congcong,Weihua,Tingyong,Adam J.,Richard P.,Keith M.,Benjamin,Feng,Yayuan,Fei,Jialin,Pan,Congcong,Weihua,Tingyong,Adam J.,Richard P.,Keith M.,Benjamin,Feng,Yayuan,Fei,Jialin,Pan,Congcong,Weihua,Tingyong,Adam J.,Richard P.,Keith M.","Extinction is considered a core mechanism underlying exposure-based therapy in anxiety-related disorders. However, marked impairments in threat extinction learning coupled with impaired neuroplasticity in patients strongly impede the efficacy of exposure-based interventions. Recent translational research suggests a role of the renin-angiotensin (RA) system in both these processes. However, the efficacy of pharmacological modulation of the RA system to enhance threat extinction in humans and the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. The present pre-registered, randomized placebo-controlled pharmacological neuroimaging trial demonstrates that pre-extinction administration of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan accelerated attenuation of the psychophysiological threat response during extinction. On the neural level the acceleration of extinction was accompanied by threat-signal specific enhanced ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation and its coupling with the basolateral amygdala. Multivoxel pattern analysis and voxel-wise mediation analysis further revealed that that losartan reduced the neural threat expression, particularly in the vmPFC, and confirmed that acceleration of extinction critically involved treatment-induced modulation of vmPFC activation. Overall the results provide the first evidence for a pivotal role of the RA system in extinction learning in humans and suggest that adjunct losartan administration can be leveraged to facilitate the efficacy of extinction-based therapies."
Biochemistry,Improving Split-HaloTag through Computational Protein Engineering,"Jonas,Lennart,Yin-Hsi,Julien,Kai,Jonas,Lennart,Yin-Hsi,Julien,Kai,Jonas,Lennart,Yin-Hsi,Julien","Split-HaloTag can be used to transform transient molecular interactions into permanent marks through chemical labeling, thereby enabling the recording of transient physiological events in individual cells. However, applications of split-HaloTag-based recorders can be limited by slow labeling rates. To address this issue, we have engineered an improved version of cpHaloΔ, the larger fragment of the split-HaloTag system. Using computational techniques, we identified stabilizing point mutations and designed a structured linker connecting the original N and C termini of the circular permutated protein, thereby significantly improving thermostability and activity of cpHaloΔ. These modifications decrease the time and substrate concentrations required for split-HaloTag-based assays and can expand their dynamic range and sensitivity."

Biochemistry,Impact of an Oxidative RNA Lesion on in vitro Replication Catalyzed by SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase,"Masataka,Kaoru,Kiyoe,Akira,Masataka,Kaoru,Kiyoe,Akira,Masataka,Kaoru,Kiyoe","The production of reactive oxygen species in response to RNA virus infection results in the oxidation of viral genomic RNA within infected cells. These oxidative RNA lesions undergo replication catalyzed by the viral replisome. G to U transversion mutations are frequently observed in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and may be linked to the replication process catalyzed by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) past the oxidative RNA lesion 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-riboguanosine (8-oxo-rG). To better understand the mechanism of viral RNA mutagenesis, it is crucial to elucidate the role of RdRp in replicating across oxidative lesions. In this study, we investigated the RNA synthesis catalyzed by the reconstituted SARS-CoV-2 RdRp past a single 8-oxo-rG. The RdRp-mediated primer extension was significantly inhibited by 8-oxo-rG on the template RNA. During the blockage of the extension reaction, the rate of product release by RdRp was extremely slow, indicating that the RdRp machinery remained bound to the replicating primer/template RNA. Once RdRp was able to bypass 8-oxo-rG, it preferentially incorporated rCMP, with a lesser amount of rAMP opposite 8-oxo-rG. In contrast, RdRp demonstrated greater activity in extending from the mutagenic rA:8-oxo-rG terminus compared to the lower efficiency of extension from the rC:8-oxo-rG pair. Based on steady-state kinetic analyses for the incorporation of rNMPs opposite 8-oxo-rG and chain extension from rC:8-oxo-rG or rA:8-oxo-rG, the relative bypass frequency for rA:8-oxo-rG was found to be seven-fold higher than that for rC:8-oxo-rG. Therefore, the properties of RdRp indicated in this study may contribute to the mechanism of mutagenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome."

Biochemistry,Role of ribosomal protein bS1 in orthogonal mRNA start codon selection,"Kristina V,Rebecca A,Minji,Jamie H D,Kristina V,Rebecca A,Minji,Jamie H D,Kristina V,Rebecca A,Minji","In many bacteria, the location of the mRNA start codon is determined by a short ribosome binding site sequence that base pairs with the 3′-end of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the 30S subunit. Many groups have changed these short sequences, termed the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence in the mRNA and the anti-Shine-Dalgarno (ASD) sequence in 16S rRNA, to create ""orthogonal"" ribosomes to enable the synthesis of orthogonal polymers in the presence of the endogenous translation machinery. However, orthogonal ribosomes are prone to SD-independent translation. Ribosomal protein bS1, which binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, is thought to promote translation initiation by shuttling mRNA to the ribosome. Thus, a better understanding of how the SD and bS1 contribute to start codon selection could help efforts to improve the orthogonality of ribosomes. Here we engineered the "

In cardiomyocytes, metabolic flexibility is crucial for the fulfillment of high energy requirements. The PDK1 isoform is abundant in cardiomyocytes, but its specific contribution to cardiomyocyte metabolism is unclear.

Although often grouped together, Presenilin-1 (PS1) and Presenilin-2 (PS2) are distinct proteins that contribute differently to γ-secretase activity. This study examines the differential expression of PS1 and PS2 in various neuroblastoma and microglial cell lines, along with compensatory responses following the ablation of one presenilin homologue. Using quantitative immunoblotting, we show that PS1 and PS2 expression levels vary significantly across cell types. Notably, the ablation of PS2 results in increased PS1 expression, particularly in microglial cells, highlighting the importance of PS2. Additionally, neuronal differentiation of two neuroblastoma lines, caused changes in protein expression levels resulting in similar expression profiles of PS1 and PS2, with PS2 levels being higher than PS1. Understanding PS expression profiles is crucial for distinguishing between PS1- and PS2-mediated γ-secretase activity and for developing γ-secretase-targeted therapeutics with improved selectivity."
Cell Biology,DIO-SPOTlight Transgenic Mouse to Functionally Monitor Protein Synthesis Regulated by the Integrated Stress Response,"Matthew L,Zachary F,Callie B.,Timothy D,Nicole,Matthew L,Zachary F,Callie B.,Timothy D,Nicole,Matthew L,Zachary F,Callie B.,Timothy D","The integrated stress response (ISR) is a core pathway for maintaining cellular proteostasis and a key regulator of translation in processes beyond the cellular response to stress. For example, the ISR regulates developmental axonogenesis, learning and memory, and synaptic plasticity in the brain. One barrier to uncovering ISR roles in health and disease is the challenge of monitoring its activity. The transient nature of regulatory phosphorylation events and lack of transgenic ISR reporter mouse lines make visually capturing the molecular hallmarks of ISR activation in specific cell types especially difficult. We recently developed the SPOTlight (Selective Phospho-eIF2alpha Open reading frame Tracking light) reporter, which uniquely provides a readout of the functional state of protein synthesis initiation dynamics that are regulated by the ISR. Here, we report the generation of a transgenic mouse line with Cre-dependent expression of SPOTlight. This resource enables selective visualization of ISR-regulated functional activity across genetically defined cell populations body-wide. Using a pan-neuronal Cre line (Nestin-Cre), we demonstrate the reporter's performance and applications for cell-specific discovery, live tissue assessments and quantitative comparisons across broad physical space. We also specifically investigated the extent to which the property of steady-state basal ISR activation, recently described in dorsal striatal cholinergic interneurons, extends to other classes of cholinergic neurons and provide a CNS-wide atlas of SPOTlight activity in these cells. The DIO-SPOTlight mouse enables a wide range of studies in all organ systems and functional monitoring opportunities not previously accessible."
Biochemistry,Assessing substrate scope of the cyclodehydratase LynD by mRNA display-enabled machine learning models,"Emma G,Henry,Jarrett M,Brian,Albert,Emma G,Henry,Jarrett M,Brian,Albert,Emma G,Henry,Jarrett M,Brian","Many of the biosynthetic pathways for ribosomal synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) natural products make use of multi-domain enzymes with separate recruitment and catalysis domains that separately bind and modify peptide substrates.  This division of labor allows RiPP enzymes to use relatively open and promiscuous active sites to perform chemistry at multiple residues within a peptide substrate seemingly regardless of the surrounding context.  Defining, measuring, and predicting the seemingly broad substrate promiscuity of RiPPs necessitates high throughput assays, capable of assessing activity against very large libraries of peptides.  Using mRNA display, a high throughput peptide display technology, we examine the substrate promiscuity of the RiPP cyclodehydratase, LynD.  The vast substrate profiling that can be done with mRNA display enables the construction of deep learning models for accurate prediction of substrate processing by LynD.  These models further inform on epistatic interactions involved in enzymatic processing.  This work will facilitate the further elucidation of other RiPP enzymes and enable their use in the modification of mRNA display libraries for selection of modified peptide-based inhibitors and therapeutics"

Caudal-type homeobox-2 (CDX2) is a conserved factor that regulates trophectoderm formation and placentation during early embryonic development but has not previously been implicated in developmentally conserved regenerative mechanisms. We earlier reported that murine Cdx2 cells restored cardiac function after intravenous delivery in male mice with experimental myocardial infarction (MI). Here we demonstrate that CDX2 cells found in human chorion are poised for cardiovascular differentiation. We isolated CDX2 cells from term placentas of 150 healthy patients and showed that they spontaneously differentiate into cardiomyocytes, functional vascular cells, and retain homing ability in vitro with a transcriptome that supports enhanced cardiogenesis, vasculogenesis, immune modulation, and chemotaxis gene signatures.  They restore cardiac function when administered to NOD/SCID mice subjected to MI. CDX2 cells can be clonally propagated in culture with retention of cardiovascular differentiation. Our data compels further use of this ethically feasible cell source in the design of therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular disease."
Cell Biology,EMC regulates cell membrane fluidity to facilitate biogenesis of membrane proteins,"Modesto,Victor,Juan,Modesto,Victor,Juan,Modesto,Victor","The EMC complex is a highly conserved transmembrane chaperone located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This complex has been associated in humans with sterol homeostasis and a myriad of different cellular activities, making the mechanism of EMC functionality enigmatic. Using fission yeast, we demonstrate that EMC assists biogenesis of the sterol transfer protein Lam6/Ltc1 at the ER-Plasma membrane and ER-Mitochondria contact sites. Cells losing EMC function sequester unfolded Lam6/Ltc1 and other proteins at the mitochondrial matrix, driving to surplus ergosterol, cold-sensitive growth and mitochondrial disfunctions. Remarkably, inhibition of the ergosterol biosynthesis, but also fluidization of cell membranes to counteract its rigidizing effects, reduce the ER-unfolded protein response and rescue growth and mitochondrial defects in EMC-deficient cells. These results indicate that EMC-assisted biogenesis of Lam6/Ltc1 provides, through ergosterol homeostasis, optimal membrane fluidity to facilitate biogenesis of other ER-membrane proteins."

Disease management strategies that stabilize intercellular adhesion, in addition to the existing immunosuppression therapies, may result in improved clinical outcomes. Previous findings showed that the serine protease inhibitor SERPINB5 promotes intercellular adhesion by binding to and regulating the localization of the desmosomal adapter molecule desmoplakin (DSP) at the plasma membrane. We here show that SERPINB5 overexpression prevents PV-IgG-mediated loss of cell-cell adhesion and the loss of DSP from the cell membrane. We mechanistically demonstrate that SERPINB5 loss deregulates TGF-β signalling, a pathway known to destabilize DSP in keratinocytes. TGF-β signalling was also activated in skin biopsies of PV patients and keratinocytes treated with PV autoantibodies, suggesting a contribution to disease. Inhibition of TGF-β activation ameliorated PV-IgG-mediated loss of cell-cell adhesion, increased DSP membrane expression, and prevented PV-IgG-induced blister formation in a human ex-vivo skin model. Together, SERPINB5 modulates DSP and intercellular adhesion through the regulation of TGF-β signalling. Further, TGF-β signalling was identified as a potential target for pemphigus treatment."

DAG subspecies with different fatty-acyl chains are proposed to be involved in the activation of distinct PKC isoforms, resulting in diverse physiological outcomes. However, the molecular players and the regulatory origin for fine-tuning the PKC pathway are unknown. Here, we show that Dip2, a conserved DAG regulator across Fungi and Animalia, has emerged as a modulator of PKC signalling in yeast. Dip2 maintains the level of a specific DAG subpopulation, required for the activation of PKC-mediated cell wall integrity pathway. Interestingly, the canonical DAG-metabolism pathways, being promiscuous, are decoupled from PKC signalling. We demonstrate that these DAG subspecies are sourced from a phosphatidylinositol pool generated by the acyl-chain remodelling pathway. Furthermore, we provide insights into the intimate coevolutionary relationship between the regulator (Dip2) and the effector (PKC) of DAG-based signalling. Hence, our study underscores the establishment of Dip2-PKC axis about 1.2 billion years ago in Opisthokonta, which marks the rooting of the first specific DAG-based signalling module of eukaryotes."

However, their direct effects on insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells remain largely unexplored. This study investigates the impact of β-blockers on insulin secretion utilizing MIN6-K8 clonal β-cells and mouse islets in vitro. Various non-selective and β1-selective β-blockers were found to amplify glucose- and glimepiride-induced insulin secretion 1.5-2 fold. Surprisingly, some of the β-blockers (propranolol and bisoprolol) were found to increase cAMP production 5-10 fold via adenylyl cyclase, the effects being dependent on α2-adrenoceptors, which suggests cross-reactivity of these β-blockers and their receptors. Propranolol-stimulated insulin secretion involves a novel signaling pathway mediated by protein kinase A (PKA), ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 5 (TRPM5).

Cell Biology,Membrane potential modulates ERK activity and cell proliferation,"Mari,Masanobu,Takuya,Fumihito,Mari,Masanobu,Takuya,Fumihito,Mari,Masanobu,Takuya","The plasma membrane potential has been linked to cell proliferation for more than 40 years. Here we experimentally showed that membrane depolarization upregulates cell mitosis, and that this process is dependent on voltage-dependent activation of ERK.  ERK activity exhibits a membrane potential-dependency that is independent from the growth factor. This membrane potential dependence was observed even close to the resting membrane potential, indicating that small changes in resting membrane potential can alter cell proliferative activity. The voltage-dependent ERK activity is derived from changed dynamics of phosphatidylserine which is present in the plasma membrane and not by extracellular calcium entry. The data suggests that crucial biological processes such as cell proliferation are regulated by the physicochemical properties of the lipid.　This study suggests that membrane potential may have diverse physiological functions beyond the action potential, which is well-established in the neural system."

We demonstrate the utility of iPASnFR for detecting polyamine import into mammalian cells, to the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and the nucleus. We demonstrate that these sensors are useful to probe the activity of polyamine transporters and to uncover biochemical pathways underlying the distribution of polyamines amongst organelles. The sensors powered a high-throughput small molecule compound library screen, revealing multiple compounds in different chemical classes that strongly modulate cellular polyamine levels. These sensors will be powerful tools to investigate the complex interplay between polyamine uptake and metabolic pathways, address open questions about their role in health and disease, and enable screening for therapeutic polyamine modulators."

Golgi Reassembly Stacking Proteins, GRASP55 and GRASP65, are vital for maintaining Golgi structure and function. GRASP55 depletion results in the missorting and secretion of the lysosomal enzyme Cathepsin D (Xiang et al., 2013), though the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we conducted secretomic analyses of GRASP55 knockout (KO) cells and found a significant increase in lysosome-associated proteins in the extracellular medium. Using the lysosomal beta-hexosaminidase subunit alpha (HEXA) as a model, we found that GRASP55 depletion disrupted normal trafficking and processing of HEXA, resulting in increased secretion of the immature (pro-form) HEXA into the extracellular milieu, along with decreased levels of the mature form and enzymatic activity within the cell. GRASP55 depletion significantly reduced the complex formation between HEXA and mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptors (MPR), despite no overall change in MPR expression. And finally, we found there was a notable reduction in the expression of GNPTAB, leading to a reduction in M6P modification of HEXA, hindering its efficient targeting to lysosomes. These findings reveal the role of GRASP55 in regulating lysosomal enzyme dynamics, emphasizing its role in the sorting and trafficking of lysosomal proteins."

Biochemistry,Mechanistic Insights into Alcohol-Induced DNA Crosslink Repair by the Fanconi Anemia Nuclease Slx4-Xpf-Ercc1,"Jana,Milan,Andrea,Anthony,Evzen,Radim,Jan,Jana,Milan,Andrea,Anthony,Evzen,Radim,Jan,Jana,Milan,Andrea,Anthony,Evzen,Radim","During cell division, DNA replication stalls upon alcohol-derived interstrand crosslink, employing DNA repair pathways. Acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of alcohol, can induce DNA crosslinks between complementary DNA strands, causing significant genomic instability. The repair of acetaldehyde DNA crosslinks (AA-ICLs) is vital for maintaining genome integrity and preventing mutagenic events. The Fanconi anemia (FA) repair pathway's involvement in fixing the AA-ICLs is crucial, ensuring cellular homeostasis and safeguarding genomic stability. Dysregulation of the FA pathway has been linked to Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, including acetaldehyde. However, the precise mechanism of the repair and incision of AA-ICLs is unknown. Here, we demonstrate the role of the FA pathway nuclease SLX4-XPF-ERCC1 (SXE) in the repair of AA-ICL. We have generated site-specific AA-ICL within the replication fork, and we found SXE to excise the crosslink from the replication fork, bringing evidence of its role in the repair of alcohol-induced DNA lesions. This nuclease complex performs two precise incisions around the lesion. We also demonstrate that the SXE nuclease excises an abasic site interstrand crosslink in a similar manner. Given the evidence in conjunction with previous repair studies that have been conducted, our work suggests that SXE is a versatile nuclease complex."

Compound lipid metabolic flux analysis (CL-MFA) enables the concurrent quantitation of fatty acid synthesis, elongation, headgroup assembly, and salvage reactions within virtually any biological system. Here, we resolve liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-mediated regulation of sphingolipid recycling in NSCLC cells and precision-cut lung slice cultures. We also demonstrate that widely used tissue culture conditions drive cells to upregulate fatty acid synthase flux to supraphysiological levels. Finally, we identify previously uncharacterized isozyme specificity of ceramide synthase inhibitors, highlighting the molecular detail revealed by CL-MFA."
Biochemistry,"Zymoseptoria tritici proteins structurally related to UmV-KP4 and UmV-KP6 are toxic to fungi, and define novel structural families of fungal effectors","Karine,Lea,Jerome,Andre,Philippe,Francois,Mounia,Justine,Yohann,Thomas,Marc-Henri,Karine,Lea,Jerome,Andre,Philippe,Francois,Mounia,Justine,Yohann,Thomas,Marc-Henri,Karine,Lea,Jerome,Andre,Philippe,Francois,Mounia,Justine,Yohann,Thomas","Fungal effectors play crucial roles in plant infection. Despite low sequence identity, their classification into families is feasible using structural homology. In this study, we have elucidated the structures of the two effectors Mycgr3-91409 and Zt-NIP1 from the wheat fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici using X-ray crystallography and NMR. These proteins shared structural homology with, respectively, KP6alpha and KP4 killer toxins, encoded by UmV dsRNA viruses infecting the corn fungal pathogen Ustilago maydis. Consequently, Zt-Mycgr3-91409 and Zt-NIP1 were renamed Zt-KP6-1 and Zt-KP4-1. Orthologs and paralogs of Zt-KP6-1 and Zt-KP4-1 were identified in Zymoseptoria species, but not in other fungi, with the exception of ECP2 effectors related to Zt-KP4-1. A novel pipeline relying on Foldseek and cysteine-pattern constrained HMM searches identified a large number of proteins structurally related to Zt-KP6-1 and Zt-KP4-1 in fungi, and to Zt-KP4-1 in plants. These proteins were classified into distinct structural super families (4 KP4 and 3 KP6) including effectors not known as structurally related to KP4 (ECP2) or KP6 (BAS4). The biological activities of Zt-KP6-1 and Zt-KP4-1 were assessed on plants and fungi. They did not induce symptoms on wheat leaves. However, they inhibited the growth of Botrytis cinerea and Z. tritici, demonstrating their toxicity to fungi. These results highlight the importance of structure determination of effectors for their classification and the prediction of their function."
Biochemistry,"Calcium-modulated cis and trans E-cadherin EC1-2 interactions play a key role in formation, dynamics and plasticity of cadherin junctions","Patrick,Patrick","Classical cadherins are ubiquitous calcium-dependent adhesive glycoproteins required in junction formation in metazoans. Calcium ions are essential for cadherin biological activity, but how they act in synergy is still a matter of controversy. We investigated by cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, a biomimetic system consisting of liposomes decorated with the two first E-cadherin extracellular modules, previously reported as functionally essential in junction formation. We showed that E-cadherin extracellular modules 1 and 2 are sufficient to form junctions in presence of calcium. Together with the first adhesive contacts, we observed the formation of cadherin patches and quasi-crystalline structures on the free surface of proteoliposomes suggesting that calcium complexation induces the self-interaction of the E-cadherin extracellular modules 1 and 2 through cis interactions. We propose that these calcium-dependent cadherin nanoplatforms, by facilitating the formation frequency of trans interactions, most probably favor the formation of junctions. We also observed a cooperative effect between trans and cis interactions leading to the protein depletion of liposome surfaces. Additionally, Cryo-electron tomography experiments performed on extracellular E-cadherin modules 1 and 2-mediated junctions revealed the coexistence of different molecular arrangements previously described from crystallography studies. Thus, this study provides a new insight into biophysical mechanisms underlying how calcium binding modulates cadherin adhesive function, in showing that E-cadherin 1 and 2 modules play a key role through their intrinsic ability to form multiple calcium-dependent cis and trans interactions, in the formation of cadherin junctions contributing to the dynamics and plasticity of cadherin-mediated cell junctions."
Cell Biology,"Novel antibodies detect nucleocytoplasmic O-fucose in protist pathogens, cellular slime molds, and plants","Megna,Elisabet,Manish,Marla,Kenjiroo,Marianne,Ralph,Robert S,Neil E,Ron,John,Christopher M,Megna,Elisabet,Manish,Marla,Kenjiroo,Marianne,Ralph,Robert S,Neil E,Ron,John,Christopher M,Megna,Elisabet,Manish,Marla,Kenjiroo,Marianne,Ralph,Robert S,Neil E,Ron,John","Cellular adaptations to change often involve post-translational modifications of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. An example found in protists and plants is the modification of serine and threonine residues of dozens to hundreds of nucleocytoplasmic proteins with a single fucose (O-Fuc). A nucleocytoplasmic O-fucosyltransferase (OFT) occurs in the pathogen Toxoplasma gondii, the social amoeba Dictyostelium, and higher plants, where it is called Spy because mutants have a spindly appearance. O-fucosylation, which is required for optimal proliferation of Toxoplasma and Dictyostelium, is paralogous to the O-GlcNAcylation of nucleocytoplasmic proteins of plants and animals that is involved in stress and nutritional responses. O-Fuc was first discovered in Toxoplasma using Aleuria aurantia lectin, but its broad specificity for terminal fucose residues on N- and O-linked glycans in the secretory pathway limits its use. Here we present affinity purified rabbit antisera that are selective for the detection and enrichment of proteins bearing fucose-O-Ser or fucose-O-Thr. These antibodies detect numerous nucleocytoplasmic proteins in Toxoplasma, Dictyostelium, and Arabidopsis, as well as O-Fuc occurring on secretory proteins of mammalian and Dictyostelium cells, although the latter are sometimes capped by further glycosylation. The antibodies label Toxoplasma, Acanthamoeba, and Dictyostelium  in a pattern reminiscent of O-GlcNAc in animal cells including nuclear pores. The O-fucome of Dictyostelium is partially conserved with that of Toxoplasma and is highly induced during starvation-induced development. These antisera demonstrate the unique antigenicity of O-Fuc, document conservation of the O-fucome among unrelated protists, and will enable the study of the O-fucomes of other organisms possessing OFT-like genes."

Cell Biology,The Integrated Stress Response Suppresses PINK1-dependent Mitophagy by Preserving Mitochondrial Import Efficiency,"Mingchong,Zengshuo,Kelly,Wen,Xiaoyan,Mingchong,Zengshuo,Kelly,Wen,Xiaoyan,Mingchong,Zengshuo,Kelly,Wen","Mitophagy is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial health, but how its levels adjust to different stress conditions remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of the DELE1-HRI axis of integrated stress response (ISR) in regulating mitophagy, a key mitochondrial stress pathway. Our findings show that the ISR suppresses mitophagy under non-depolarizing mitochondrial stress by positively regulating mitochondrial protein import, independent of ATF4 activation. Mitochondrial protein import is regulated by the rate of protein synthesis under both depolarizing and non-depolarizing stress. Without ISR, increased protein synthesis overwhelms the mitochondrial import machinery, reducing its efficiency. Under depolarizing stress, mitochondrial import is heavily impaired even with active ISR, leading to significant PINK1 accumulation. In contrast, non-depolarizing stress allows more efficient protein import in the presence of ISR, resulting in lower mitophagy. Without ISR, mitochondrial protein import becomes severely compromised, causing PINK1 accumulation to reach the threshold necessary to trigger mitophagy. These findings reveal a novel link between ISR-regulated protein synthesis, mitochondrial import, and mitophagy, offering potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction."

Localized Marker Detector (LMD) is a novel tool to identify ""localized genes"" - genes exclusively expressed in groups of highly similar cells - thereby characterizing cellular diversity in a multi-resolution and fine-grained manner. LMD constructs a cell-cell affinity graph, diffuses the gene expression value across the cell graph, and assigns a score to each gene based on its diffusion dynamics. LMD's candidate markers can be grouped into functional gene modules, which accurately reflect cell types, subtypes, and other sources of variation such as cell cycle status. We apply LMD to mouse bone marrow and hair follicle dermal condensate datasets, where LMD facilitates cross-sample comparisons, identifying shared and sample-specific gene signatures and novel cell populations without requiring batch effect correction or integration methods. Furthermore, we assessed the performance of LMD across nine single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, compared it with six other methods aimed at achieving similar objectives, and found that LMD outperforms the other methods evaluated."

Gilberto,Gisele Sampaio,Julian,Saloomeh,Ona,Aneesh B.,R. Gilberto,Gisele Sampaio,Julian,Saloomeh,Ona","Selected patients with large vessel occlusions (LVO) can benefit from thrombectomy up to 24 hours after onset. Identifying patients who might benefit from late intervention after transfer from community hospitals to thrombectomy-capable centers would be valuable. We searched for presentation biomarkers to identify such patients. Frequent MR imaging over 2 days of 38 untreated LVO patients revealed logarithmic growth of the ischemic infarct core. In 24 patients with terminal internal carotid artery or the proximal middle cerebral artery occlusions we found that an infarct core growth rate (IGR) <4.1 ml/hr and initial infarct core volumes (ICV) <19.9 ml had accuracies >89% for identifying patients who would still have a core of <50ml 24 hours after stroke onset, a core size that should predict favorable outcomes with thrombectomy. Published reports indicate that up to half of all LVO stroke patients have an IGR<4.1 ml/hr. Other potentially useful biomarkers include the NIHSS and the perfusion measurements MTT and Tmax. We conclude that many LVO patients have a stroke physiology that is favorable for late intervention, and that there are biomarkers that can accurately identify them at early time points as suitable for transfer for intervention."
Bioinformatics,Protein Sequence Domain Annotation using Language Models,"Arpan,Kumaresh,Sean R,Arpan,Kumaresh,Sean R,Arpan,Kumaresh","Protein function inference relies on annotating protein domains via sequence similarity, often modeled through profile Hidden Markov Models (profile HMMs), which capture evolutionary diversity within related domains. However, profile HMMs make strong simplifying independence assumptions when modeling residues in a sequence. Here, we introduce PSALM (Protein Sequence Annotation using Language Models), a hierarchical approach that relaxes these assumptions and uses representations of protein sequences learned by protein language models to enable high-sensitivity, high-specificity residue-level protein sequence annotation. We also develop the Multi-Domain Protein Homology Benchmark (MDPH-Bench), a benchmark for protein sequence domain annotation, where training and test sequences have been rigorously split to share no similarity between any of their domains at a given threshold of sequence identity. Prior benchmarks, which split one domain family at a time, do not support methods for annotating multi-domain proteins, where training and test sequences need to have multiple domains from different families. We validate PSALM's performance on MDPH-Bench and highlight PSALM as a promising alternative to HMMER, a state-of-the-art profile HMM-based method, for protein sequence annotation."

Previously, we reported the discovery of ASOs that target a novel, putative intronic RNA structure to rescue splicing of multiple pathogenic variants of F8 exon 16 that cause hemophilia A. However, the conventional approach to discovering splice-modulating ASOs is both laborious and expensive. Here, we describe an alternative paradigm that integrates data-driven RNA structure prediction and community science to discover splice-modulating ASOs. Using a splicing-deficient pathogenic variant of F8 exon 16 as a model, we show that 25% of the top-scoring molecules designed in the Eterna OpenASO challenge have a statistically significant impact on enhancing exon 16 splicing. Additionally, we show that a distinct combination of ASOs designed by Eterna players can additively enhance the inclusion of the splicing-deficient exon 16 variant. Together, our data suggests that crowdsourcing designs from a community of citizen scientists may accelerate the discovery of splice-modulating ASOs with potential to treat human disease."

Here, we present parallel in cellulo, in vitro, and in silico structure-function analyses of the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and RING domain structural characteristics of whole TRIM protein family. In-depth follow-up studies of this comprehensive dataset reveals a number of pseudoligases, whose RING domains have structurally diverged at either the homodimerisation or E2~ubiquitin interfaces, thereby disrupting their ability to catalyse ubiquitin transfer.

Sakil,Md. Sohel","Background: The metabolic syndrome (Met-S) is a cluster of some interrelated common clinical disorders, including central obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and glucose intolerance. Central obesity, accompanied by insulin resistance, is a key factor for the development of metabolic syndrome. Adiponectin is an adipose-specific plasma protein, secreted from adipocyte with anti-atherogenic and insulin-sensitizing activities.
Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the relationship of plasma adiponectin levels with metabolic syndrome, related disorders and it's drug repurposing through in silico approach.
Materials and Methods: For this study, 269 individuals were recruited with written consent. The participants were selected based on their full medical history, clinical examination, and laboratory reports. Anthropometric measurements as well as blood pressure was measured before sample collection. Fasting blood samples were collected for the estimation of lipid profile, blood glucose, and serum adiponectin levels.
Results: Our results show that the adiponectin levels in the subjects with Met-S were significantly lower than those of without Met-S (p <0.0001). Among the metabolic syndrome risk factors, adiponectin levels were associated with hypertriglyceridemia and reduced HDL-cholesterol (p<0.0001). Three drugs (Saquinavir, Candesartan and Glimepiride) were suggested to control the plasma adiponectin level in the subjects with Met-S.
Conclusions: Since the plasma adiponectin levels are significantly lower in patients with Met-S, it might be used as diagnostic & prognostic marker for Met-S disorder and adiponectin targeted drugs might be minimize the Met-S of the subjects."
Cell Biology,Mitotic spindle orientation and dynamics are fine-tuned by anisotropic tissue stretch via NuMA localisation,"Nawseen,Dionn,Dessislava,Georgina K,Oliver E.,Sarah,Nawseen,Dionn,Dessislava,Georgina K,Oliver E.,Sarah,Nawseen,Dionn,Dessislava,Georgina K,Oliver E.","Cell division orientation, which is key to cell fate and shaping tissues, is influenced by mechanical forces. For example, in uniaxially stretched tissue most divisions orient along the stretch axis. This mechanosensitive division orientation can be achieved by distinct mechanisms involving a direct response to force or an indirect response to force via cell shape changes. Cells also generally align divisions along their long axis of interphase shape. Since stretching a tissue elongates cells, uncoupling whether divisions orient in response to force or to cell shape remains challenging. Here, we utilised the Xenopus laevis embryonic animal cap tissue, to which a reproducible external stretch can be applied, to understand mechanosensitive division orientation. We focused on nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA), which is key to spindle orientation. We show that NuMA is dynamically localised to the cell cortex earlier during mitosis in uniaxially stretched tissues. This temporal cortical recruitment of NuMA coincides with the onset and subsequent stretch-induced amplification of spindle oscillations. Additionally, we show that knockdown of NuMA reduces spindle oscillations and disrupts division orientation according to stretch and cell shape. We also show that divisions dynamically align with cell shape under tissue stretch and that this involves a direct response to force via NuMA localisation, rather than an indirect response to force via cell shape changes. Overall, using live tissue imaging, mathematical modelling, and tissue mechanics our results indicate that NuMA fine tunes spindle dynamics and ensures the accurate alignment of divisions with cell shape and anisotropic tension."

Although many PAK substrates identified are implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a coherent picture of the total effect of PAK activation on the state of the actin cytoskeleton is unclear. We therefore set out to observe and quantify the effect of PAK inhibition on the actin cytoskeleton in greater detail. In Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts, inhibition of PAK kinase activity, either by treatment with small molecule inhibitors or overexpression of mutant PAK constructs leads to the constitutive production of patches of the phosphoinositide PIP3 on the ventral surface of the cell. The formation of these patches remodels the actin cytoskeleton and polarises the cell. From the overexpression of truncated and mutant PAK constructs as well as an in vitro model of PAK recruitment to small GTPases we propose that this is due to a hyper recruitment of PAK and PAK binding partners in the absence of PAK kinase activity. This aberrant production of PIP3 suggests that the kinase activity of class I PAKs acts to downregulate PI3K activity further highlighting class I PAKs as regulators of PI3K activity and therefore the excitability of the actin cytoskeleton."

D.,Anita,Joachim E,Marius,Sherif,Harald,Adrian C. D.,Anita,Joachim E,Marius,Sherif,Harald,Adrian C. D.,Anita","The biosynthesis of cAMP by mammalian membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases (mACs) is predominantly regulated by G-protein-coupled-receptors (GPCRs). Up to now the two hexahelical transmembrane domains of mACs were considered to fix the enzyme to membranes. Here we show that the transmembrane domains serve in addition as signal receptors and transmitters of lipid signals that control Gsalpha-stimulated mAC activities. We identify aliphatic fatty acids and anandamide as receptor ligands of mAC isoforms 1 to 7 and 9. The ligands enhance (mAC isoforms 2, 3, 7, and 9) or attenuate (isoforms 1, 4, 5, and 6) Gsalpha-stimulated mAC activities in vitro and in vivo. Substitution of the stimulatory membrane receptor of mAC3 by the inhibitory receptor of mAC5 results in a ligand inhibited mAC5-mAC3 chimera. Thus, we discovered a new class of membrane receptors in which two signaling modalities are at a crossing, direct tonic lipid and indirect phasic GPCR-Gsalpha signaling regulating the biosynthesis of cAMP."

Building on our prior research establishing nuclear speckles as a pivotal membrane-less organelle responsible for global proteostasis transcriptional control, we aim to alleviate proteinopathies through nuclear speckle rejuvenation. We identified pyrvinium pamoate as a small-molecule nuclear speckle rejuvenator that enhances protein quality control while suppressing YAP1 signaling via decreasing the surface/interfacial tension of nuclear speckle condensates through interaction with the intrinsically disordered region of nuclear speckle scaffold protein SON. In pre-clinical models, nanomolar pyrvinium pamoate alleviated retina degeneration and reduced tauopathy by promoting autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome system in a SON-dependent manner without causing cellular stress. Aberrant nuclear speckle morphology, reduced protein quality control and increased YAP1 activity were also observed in human tauopathies. Our study uncovers novel therapeutic targets for tackling protein misfolding disorders within an expanded proteostasis framework encompassing nuclear speckles and YAP1."

Currently, a variety of miRNA target prediction tools are available, that analyze sequence complementarity, thermodynamic stability, and evolutionary conservation to predict miRNA-target interactions (MTIs) within the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). We propose a concept for further screening of human sequence-based predicted MTIs by considering the disease similarity between miRNAs and genes to establish a prediction database of disease-specific MTIs. We fine-tuned the Sentence-BERT model to calculate the semantic similarity of disease. The method achieved an F1 score of 0.88 in accurately distinguishing human protein-level experimentally (Western Blot, Reporter Assay, etc.) validated MTIs and predicted MTIs. Moreover, this method exhibits exceptional generalizability across different databases. The proposed method was utilized to calculate the similarity of disease in 1,220,904 human MTIs from miRTarbase, miRDB, and miRWalk, involving 6,085 genes and 1,261 pre-miRNAs. The study holds the potential to offer valuable insights into comprehending miRNA-gene regulatory networks and advancing progress in disease diagnosis, treatment, and drug development."
Bioinformatics,"Critical issues found in ""Dissecting cell identity via network inference and in silico gene perturbation""","Jalil,Antoine,Sven,Jalil,Antoine,Sven,Jalil,Antoine","In the 2023 Nature publication ""Dissecting cell identity via network inference and in silico gene perturbation"" [1], the authors introduced CellOracle (CO), a novel method leveraging mRNA-seq and ATAC-seq data to construct gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which are subsequently used for gene perturbation. They designed CO to account for the role of distal cis-regulatory elements, e.g. enhancers, as well as proximal promoters in the gene regulation system. For this purpose, they employed Cicero to determine the co-accessibility scores between peaks, provided by ATAC-seq data. These scores are then used to identify the interaction of distal regions with the target gene. Using CO, they have conducted multiple perturbation studies on different organisms and identified novel phenotypes resulting from transcriptional factor (TF) perturbation. In addition, they benchmarked CO's performance using ChIP-seq data as ground truth against other state-of-the-art GRN methods across multiple mouse tissue samples. However, our evaluation reveals critical limitations in the implementation of their methodology, both in terms of ATAC-seq data integration as well as benchmarking. In this report, we first explain the limitations in their approach of integrating ATAC-seq data. We show that the proposed algorithm fails to account for distal regulatory interactions. After, we present the issues associated with their benchmarking algorithm and the data used for benchmarking. We show that their findings regarding the comparative performance of CO against other GRN inference methods is invalid and requires further evaluation. In conclusion, we detect multiple inaccuracies in this paper which undermine the validity of their published protocol and the results.

Biochemistry,How the microbiome liberates iron from heme,"Arnab Kumar,Ronivaldo Rodrigues,Emmanuel,Victoria,Mensur,C. Martin,Jennifer,Arnab Kumar,Ronivaldo Rodrigues,Emmanuel,Victoria,Mensur,C. Martin,Jennifer,Arnab Kumar,Ronivaldo Rodrigues,Emmanuel,Victoria,Mensur,C. Martin","The microbiome is a hidden organ system with diverse metabolic roles. Using Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B theta) as a model, we asked how microbiome species process iron, the quintessential biometal supporting respiration and life as we know it, when iron is provided in complex with protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) as heme. Canonical pathways for reclaiming heme-iron from host cells or the diet require O2, which is unavailable in the GI tract and many pathological microenvironments. HmuS, a homolog of cobalamine- (vitamin B12) and chlorophyll-building chelatases, is widespread in anaerobic microbial ecosystems. In this work, we provide direct physiological, biochemical, and structural evidence for the anaerobic removal of iron from heme by HmuS, a de-chelatase that deconstructs heme to PPIX and Fe(II). We show that heme can be used as a sole iron source by B theta, yielding PPIX, and that hmuS inactivation under these conditions is lethal. Iron removal from heme depends on the B theta membrane fraction, NADH, and O2 exclusion. Absorbance spectra indicate that heterologously expressed HmuS is isolated with a non-substrate heme bound and can accommodate multiple heme equivalents under saturating conditions. Solution of the cryoEM structure reveals heme and two cations at sites that are conserved across the HmuS family and the chelatase superfamily, respectively. The proposed structure-based mechanism for iron removal further links biosynthetic and biodegradative pathways for heme, chlorophyll, and vitamin B12, 3 ancient and biologically crucial metallocofactors."

We modeled the non-linear dynamics of macrophage polarization states (M0/M1/M2), tumor cell killing by macrophages, and evasion of macrophage mediated killing by tumor originated extracellular vesicle decoys. Solving these coupled differential equations using numerical approaches, showed that the rate of macrophage polarization into the M1 state is the critical determinant of anti-tumor activity mediated by M1 polarized macrophages. To determine what metabolomic factors correlate with the polarization of naive macrophage into anti-tumor M1 or pro-tumor M2 phenotypes, we performed LC/MS-based untargeted metabolomic analysis. Statistical analysis using Python-Scikit-learn was performed on the metabo-lomic data from naive, M1 or M2 polarized murine macrophages followed by multiple feature selection methods. Application of ensemble machine learning methods to both secreted and cell associated metabolites revealed novel molecules of fatty acid metabolism to be the main mediators of polarization. Integration of ensemble machine learning feature-ranking tools into our analysis of metabolomic data identified new potential targets in macrophage metabolism for enhancing anti-tumor activities."
Animal Behavior and Cognition,Fine Social Discrimination of Siblings in Mice: Implications for Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease,"Lola MP,Sébastien,Camille,Claire,Laure,Lola MP,Sébastien,Camille,Claire,Laure,Lola MP,Sébastien,Camille,Claire","The ability to distinguish between individuals is crucial for social species and supports behaviors like reproduction, hierarchy formation, and cooperation. In rodents, social discrimination relies on memory and recognition of individual-specific cues, known as individual signatures. While olfactory signals are central, other sensory cues - such as auditory, visual, and tactile inputs - also play a role. However, little research has explored the fine discrimination of individuals with overlapping cues, such as siblings or cohabitating mice. This study investigates whether mice can discriminate between two closely related individuals: siblings from the same litter and cage. We tested the hypothesis that it would be more challenging for mice to distinguish between siblings than between unrelated mice due to shared cues. Moreover, social cognitive impairments are common in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), where difficulties in recognizing faces and voices progressively disrupt social interactions in patients. Using a mouse model of AD (Tg2576), known for the progressive onset of cognitive deficits, we assessed whether the ability to discriminate between siblings is preserved in pre-symptomatic animals. Thus, we first demonstrated that male and female C57BL6/J mice can discriminate siblings, regardless of sex. Then, we revealed that pre-symptomatic 3-month-old Tg2576 mice exhibit impairments in subtle social memory, while their general social memory remains unaffected. Hence, we demonstrate that the inability to perform fine social discrimination is an early cognitive impairment that arises before other well-documented memory abnormalities in this AD mouse model."
Animal Behavior and Cognition,Reasoning by exclusion in food-caching Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius),"Isobelle,Michael,Susan,Nicola  S.,Isobelle,Michael,Susan,Nicola  S.,Isobelle,Michael,Susan","Two related methods have been widely used to test animals' capacity to reason by exclusion: Call's (2004) 2-cups task, where subjects choose between two cups in which one reward was hidden and the empty cup is revealed; and Premack & Premack's task (1994) where one reward goes in each of the two cups and one reward is removed. In both cases, success is identifying the cup with the reward. It has been suggested that among corvids, the demands associated with caching may foster exclusion abilities by reinforcing the experience of relevant contraries (e.g., empty vs. full), or by supporting domain general capacities that support caching and exclusion inferences. However, Shaw et al. (2013) found that Eurasian jays, proficient cachers, failed a version of Call's 2-cups task. To further test the caching hypothesis, we amended the procedure using invisible displacement to hide rewards, removing aspects of Shaw et al.'s procedure that may have masked competence of Eurasian jays. We tested seven Eurasian jays, who showed spontaneous success on both Call's 1-reward/show-empty (80% correct) and Premack and Premack's 2-reward/remove-1 (85% correct). These results align with the hypothesis that corvids' exclusion reasoning is related to caching behaviour."
Animal Behavior and Cognition,What matters to a mouse? Effects of internal and external context on male vocal response to female squeaks,"Lauren  Riley,Laura  M,Lauren  Riley,Laura  M,Lauren  Riley","Individuals plastically adjust their signaling behavior depending on the social context of an interaction, but which aspects of context elicit the strongest responses from individuals is often difficult to determine. To explore how internal and external contextual factors influence the communication of house mice, we employed a split-cage playback assay to assess how dominant and subordinate male mice differed in their ultrasonic vocalization (USV) production in response to playback of broadband vocalizations (BBVs, or squeaks). We assessed how individuals altered their behavior depending on the odors present during the assay: either just female odors (Fem condition) or female odors in addition to the odors of potential competitors, other males (Fem+Male condition). Using this repeated-measures design, we evaluated two distinct cohorts of individuals: males exposed to the odor of familiar competitors in the Fem+Male condition (Familiar odor cohort), and males exposed to the odor of unfamiliar competitors in the Fem+Male condition (Unfamiliar odor cohort). While dominants and subordinates did not differ in their baseline vocal production or response to squeaks, all groups reduced their vocal production in response to BBV playback, and the addition of unfamiliar male odor prompted mice to decrease their baseline levels of calling and decrease the complexity of their vocal repertoire. Importantly, this effect of additional male odor was not present when individuals were presented with male odor familiar to them. These findings suggest that mice alter their vocal behavior during courtship interactions in response to cues that indicate the presence of potential competitors, and this response is modulated by the familiarity of these competitor cues."
Animal Behavior and Cognition,Better and faster collective decisions by larger fish shoals in the wild,"Korbinian,David,Yunus,Carla,Alejandro,Jesus Emmanuel,Stefan,Max,Pawel,Lenin,Jens,Korbinian,David,Yunus,Carla,Alejandro,Jesus Emmanuel,Stefan,Max,Pawel,Lenin,Jens,Korbinian,David,Yunus,Carla,Alejandro,Jesus Emmanuel,Stefan,Max,Pawel,Lenin","Studies on collective cognition have provided many examples of decision-making benefits in terms of animals sharing information about predators, prey or resources in their environment. It has been shown how the efficient spread of adaptive information within groups can pro-vide benefits which increase with group size. Little is known, however, to which extent groups also amplify maladaptive information such as false alarms and whether such costs reduce or even nullify the above benefits. Here, we investigated fish shoals in the wild that responded collectively with escape dives when attacked by birds. We analysed the response of shoals in reaction to hard-to-detect bird attacks and similar but harmless flybys as a func-tion of shoal size. With increasing shoal size fish increasingly detected predator attacks (true positives) while their false alarms remained constant. Therefore, larger shoals became better at correctly classifying potentially dangerous stimuli rather than becoming more sensitive to all stimuli potentially related to attacks. In addition, decision time decreased with increasing shoal size. Larger shoals were thus able to mitigate two major trade-offs inherent in solitary decision making: the trade-off between true and false positives and the trade-off between speed and accuracy. We report performance increases at shoal sizes of tens of thousands of fish and pose challenges for the modelling of the underlying mechanisms."
Animal Behavior and Cognition,Visual-spatial dynamics drive adaptive social learning in immersive environments,"Charley M.,Dominik,Benjamin,Bjorn,Mark H,Ralf HJM,Charley M.,Dominik,Benjamin,Bjorn,Mark H,Ralf HJM,Charley M.,Dominik,Benjamin,Bjorn,Mark H","Human cognition is distinguished by our ability to adapt to different environments and circumstances. Yet the mechanisms driving adaptive behavior have predominantly been studied in separate asocial and social contexts, with an integrated framework remaining elusive. Here, we use a collective foraging task in a virtual Minecraft environment to integrate these two fields, by leveraging automated transcriptions of visual field data combined with high-resolution spatial trajectories. Our behavioral analyses capture both the structure and temporal dynamics of social interactions, which are then directly tested using computational models sequentially predicting each foraging decision. These results reveal that adaptation mechanisms of both asocial foraging and selective social learning are driven by individual foraging success (rather than social factors). Furthermore, it is the degree of adaptivity---of both asocial and social learning---that best predicts individual performance. These findings not only integrate theories across asocial and social domains, but also provide key insights into the adaptability of human decision-making in complex and dynamic social landscapes."
Animal Behavior and Cognition,Analysis of coordinated group behavior based on role-sharing: Practical application from an experimental task to a 3-on-3 basketball game as a pilot study,"Jun,Masatoshi,Keisuke,Jun,Masatoshi,Keisuke,Jun,Masatoshi","A human group shares a common goal and distributes roles to implement activities that are difficult to accomplish alone and higher performance than an individual. In such coordination, nonverbal behavior among three or more members makes it difficult to explain the mechanism because of complex and dynamic interactions. In cognitive science, a crucial role is indicated, which intervenes moderately with others and adjusts the whole balance without interrupting their main smooth interactions, using an experimental task. It suggests that the third role and related playing supports to coordination. This is similar to off-ball movements in team sports, which are not involved directly with the ball and are focused on mainly in sports science because common statistical data do not reflect. A new perspective for discussing coordination has arisen because existing theories, such as synchronization, cannot explain the mentioned role; however, there is room for its usefulness. Therefore, this study applied the experimental findings to the sports field. We designed a 3-on-3 basketball game in which the relevant offensive role is key and introduced it to the practice of the university team as a pilot study. Participants repeatedly engaged in the mini-game, and the playing on the offensive team was compared before and after receiving tips on this role. Consequently, in the bins of the relatively large distance between the participant required in this role and each defensive player, the frequencies after the tips were significantly higher, and the winning rate on the offensive team improved temporarily. It suggests that the spacing skill, which indicates a reasonable distance for intervening with the other offensive players, emerged. This study may provide findings that satisfy usefulness and ecological validity, and make an educational contribution about giving the tips of off-ball movements."
Animal Behavior and Cognition,Bumblebees increase their learning flight altitude in dense environments,"Annkathrin,Mathieu,Olivier J. N.,Martin,Annkathrin,Mathieu,Olivier J. N.,Martin,Annkathrin,Mathieu,Olivier J. N.","Bumblebees rely on visual memories acquired during the first outbound flights to relocate their nest. While these learning flights have been extensively studied in sparse environments with few objects, little is known about how bees adapt their flight in more dense, cluttered, settings that better mimic their natural habitats. Here we investigated how environmental complexity influences the first outbound flights of bumblebees. In a large arena we tracked the bees' 3D positions to examine the flight patterns, body orientations, and nest fixations across environmental conditions characterised by different  object constellations around the nest entrance.
In cluttered environments, bees prioritised altitude gain over horizontal distance, suggesting a strategy to overcome obstacles and visual clutter. Body orientation patterns became more diverse in dense environments, indicating a balance between nest-oriented learning and obstacle avoidance. Notably, bees consistently preferred to fixate the location of the nest entrance from elevated positions above the dense environment across all conditions. Our results reveal significant changes in 3D flight structure, body orientations, and nest fixation behaviours as object density increases. This highlights the importance of considering three-dimensional space and environmental complexity in understanding insect navigation."
Animal Behavior and Cognition,Whistle variability and social acoustic interactions in bottlenose dolphins,"Faadil,Chiara,Dean,Emiliano,Zohria-Lys,Agathe,ines,Elisabeth,Nadav,Gonzalo G.,German,Faadil,Chiara,Dean,Emiliano,Zohria-Lys,Agathe,ines,Elisabeth,Nadav,Gonzalo G.,German,Faadil,Chiara,Dean,Emiliano,Zohria-Lys,Agathe,ines,Elisabeth,Nadav,Gonzalo G.","Bottlenose dolphins exhibit a sophisticated social structure, known as a fission-fusion society. To sustain this complex system, dolphins rely on a rich vocal repertoire: clicks exclusively used for echolocation, burst-pulse sounds associated with emotions during social interactions, and whistles, including signature whistles that serve as individual-specific identifiers (names). 
How dolphins maintain their complex social structure based only on a limited repertoire of sounds remains elusive. Previous studies suggest that contextual information can be transferred by the modulation of the whistles.
Here, we investigated the whistle variability using a comprehensive computational approach, and studied the structure of the interactions between the whistle variants. Using a unique large dataset, acquired in a natural environment, we observed that signature whistles exhibit variations in their frequency contours. Unsupervised clustering revealed that signature whistles could be classified into sub-categories (signature whistle variants). The existence of these categories, and their independence on the emitter dolphin, indicate that these variations are not random. Analysis of pairwise interactions between sub-categories revealed a clustered structure similar to that of their social hierarchy. Network analysis of this structure showed that whistle sub-categories had different functional roles: some acted as hubs, others as bridges, and certain were used for turn-taking between the main whistle categories. We also found that the dolphins emit signature whistles of their deceased mothers, a phenomenon only observed in human language."

Here we report the structure and function of a bacterial WTAs rhamnosyltransferase, RmlT, strictly required for , WTAs rhamnosylation. In particular, we demonstrated that RmlT transfers rhamnose from dTDP-L-rhamnose to naked WTAs, and that specificity towards TDP-rhamnose is not determined by its binding affinity. Structures of RmlT with and without its substrates showed that this enzyme is a dimer, revealed the residues responsible for interaction with the substrates and that the catalytic residue pre-orients the acceptor substrate towards the nucleophilic attack to the sugar. Additionally, the structures provided indications for two potential interaction pathways for the long WTAs on the surface of RmlT. Finally, we confirmed that WTAs glycosyltransferases are promising targets for next-generation strategies against Gram-positive pathogens by showing that inactivation of the RmlT catalytic activity results in a decreased infection "

Biochemistry,Role of ribosomal protein bS1 in orthogonal mRNA start codon selection,"Kristina V.,Rebecca A.,Minji,Jamie H. D.,Kristina V.,Rebecca A.,Minji,Jamie H. D.,Kristina V.,Rebecca A.,Minji","In many bacteria, the location of the mRNA start codon is determined by a short ribosome binding site sequence that base pairs with the 3′-end of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the 30S subunit. Many groups have changed these short sequences, termed the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence in the mRNA and the anti-Shine-Dalgarno (ASD) sequence in 16S rRNA, to create “orthogonal” ribosomes to enable the synthesis of orthogonal polymers in the presence of the endogenous translation machinery. However, orthogonal ribosomes are prone to SD-independent translation. Ribosomal protein bS1, which binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, is thought to promote translation initiation by shuttling mRNA to the ribosome. Thus, a better understanding of how the SD and bS1 contribute to start codon selection could help efforts to improve the orthogonality of ribosomes. Here we engineered the , ribosome to prevent binding of bS1 to the 30S subunit, to separate the activity of bS1 binding to the ribosome from the role of the mRNA SD sequence in start codon selection. We find that ribosomes lacking bS1 are slightly less active than wild-type ribosomes "

In vivo labeling approaches using radiotracers primarily show CD8, T cell distributions, while ex vivo labeled CD8, T cells can show CD8, T cell migration patterns, homing, and tumor infiltration. Currently, a comprehensive head-to-head comparison of in vivo and ex- vivo cell labeling with respect to their tumor and normal tissue targeting properties and correlation to the presence of CD8, T cells is lacking, yet essential for correct interpretation of clinical CD8, imaging applications. Therefore, we performed a head-to-head comparison of three different CD8, T cell imaging approaches: 1) ,Zr-labeled DFO-conjugated Fc-silent anti-CD8 antibody ([,Zr]Zr-anti-CD8-IgG2a,), 2) ex vivo ,Zr-oxine labeled ovalbumin-specific CD8, T cells ([,Zr]Zr-OT-I cells), and 3) ,F-labeled IL2 ([,F]AlF-RESCA-IL2).
Methods
B16F10/OVA tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice (n=10/group) received intravenously one of the three radiopharmaceuticals. PET/CT images were acquired starting 72 h ([,Zr]Zr-anti-CD8-IgG2a,), 24 and 48 h ([,Zr]Zr-OT-I cells), and 10 min ([,F]AlF-RESCA-IL2) post injection. Subsequently, ex vivo biodistribution analysis of the radiopharmaceuticals was performed followed by flow cytometric analysis to evaluate the number of intratumoral CD8, T cells. Additionally, the intratumoral radiolabel distributions was assessed by autoradiography and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tumor slices.
Results
[,Zr]Zr-anti-CD8-IgG2a,, [,Zr]Zr-OT-I cells, and [,F]AlF-RESCA-IL2 showed uptake in CD8-rich tissues, with preferential targeting to the spleen. Biodistribution analysis showed tumor uptake above blood level for all radiopharmaceuticals, except [,F]AlF-RESCA-IL2. For all three approaches, the uptake in the tumor-draining lymph node was significantly higher compared with the contralateral axial lymph node, suggesting that all approaches allow evaluation of immune responses involving CD8, T cells. Tumor uptake of [,Zr]Zr-anti-CD8-IgG2a, (R,=0.65, p<0.01) and [,Zr]Zr-OT-I cells (R,=0.74, p<0.01) correlated to the number of intratumoral CD8, T cells (flow cytometry). The intratumoral distribution pattern of the radiosignal was different for ex vivo and in vivo radiolabeling techniques. The short half-life of ,F precluded autoradiography assessment of [,F]AlF-RESCA-IL2.
Conclusion
We show that [,Zr]Zr-anti-CD8-IgG2a, and [,Zr]Zr-OT-I cells PET/CT imaging can be used to evaluate intratumoral CD8, T cells, even though their normal tissues and intratumoral distribution patterns are significantly different. Based on their characteristics, [,Zr]Zr-anti-CD8-IgG2a, might be most useful to immunophenotyping the TME, while the ex vivo cell labeling approach visualizes CD8, T cell migrations patterns and the permissiveness of tumors for invasion, whereas [,F]AlF-RESCA-IL2 allows for rapid recurrent imaging and might prove useful for tracking rapid changes in CD8, T cell distributions.

In the melanic marginal band, Dsx is required in each sex to enforce the presence of lanceolate scales in males, and their absence in females. Single-nucleus RNAseq reveals that UV-iridescent and lanceolate scale cell precursors each show distinctive gene expression profiles at 40% of pupal development, with marker genes that include regulators of transcription, cell signaling, cytoskeletal patterning, and chitin secretion.

Here, we explore some ways that a sublinear predator-prey scaling could emerge from density-dependent interactions among predators and between predators and prey (which we call a top-down origin), rather than among prey (bottom-up origin) as proposed in Hatton "

Over time, declines in infectious disease continue but chronic and degenerative causes persist,, so we might expect under-5 deaths to be concentrated in the first month of life. However, little is known about the age-pattern of this transition in early mortality or its potential limits. Here we first describe the limit using detailed data on Denmark, Japan, France, and the USA— developed countries with low under-5 mortality. The limiting pattern of under-5 deaths concentrates in the first month, but is surprisingly dispersed over later ages: we call this the early rectangularization of mortality. Then we examine the progress towards this limit of 31 developing countries from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)—the region with the highest under-5 mortality"

Here, we focus on AvrStb6, a major effector of the global wheat pathogen ,, evolving in response to the cognate receptor Stb6, a resistance widely deployed in wheat. We comprehensively captured effector gene evolution by analyzing a global thousand-genome panel using reference-free sequence analyses. We found that AvrStb6 has diversified into 59 protein isoforms with a strong association to the pathogen spreading to new continents. Across Europe, we found the strongest differentiation of the effector consistent with high rates of Stb6 deployment.

However, most of these studies have been limited by their focus on mammalian systems. Here, we aimed to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms that are active during lung growth and tissue repair in amphibians, specifically Xenopus tropicalis (,). First, we analyzed the stem cell composition and signaling pathways that are active in epithelial and mesenchymal cells during lung growth. Then, we established a protocol for lung injury to assess the types of stem cells underlying tissue repair. In mammals, Sftpc+ (AT2) cells are alveolar stem cells that can differentiate to Krt8+ cells during lung homeostasis and post-injury repair. In this study, we identified Sftpc+ cells and Krt8+ cells, along with the activity of key developmental signaling pathways, Hippo and Wnt, during lung maturation at post-metamorphosis stages. We then established a protocol for lung injury using chemically induced injury with bleomycin, which damages the lung through oxidative stress. The results show an elevation in collagen post-injury, indicating bleomycin’s effect in causing lung fibrosis. , froglets survived 42 days post-injury, with a continuous decrease in fibrosis. To explore this effect, we analyzed the distribution of lung stem cells; Sox9 protein levels and Sftp gene expression were downregulated at the alveoli 42 days post-injury. The decrease in stem cell marker expression 42 days post-injury suggests they are differentiating as part of the healing process. Nevertheless, we could still detect them after a few weeks of healing. These results suggest that , has a regenerative capacity for lung tissue repair and that the same signaling pathways and stem cells are active in both amphibians and mammalian lungs during lung growth, regeneration, and healing. These findings show for the first time the physiological similarities between the anuran and the mammalian lung during growth and tissue repair processes, suggesting "

It is therefore important to study WNT/β-catenin signalling directly in models of early human development. Since TCF/LEF factors mediate the regulation of target genes downstream of WNT/β-catenin signalling, we studied the expression and protein localisation of the four TCF/LEF genes by analysing , “snapshots” of human development, leveraging naïve and primed pluripotent cells as well as extraembryonic and early embryonic cell lineages. Strikingly, we comprehensively confirm clear differences between mouse and human pluripotent stem cells, suggesting species-specific requirements for WNT signalling that may reflect differences in states of pluripotency. Human naïve ES cells express very low TCF7L1, unlike their mouse counterparts. TCF7L2 is robustly expressed in human naïve ES-derived trophectoderm cells. In human primed pluripotent stem cells, activation of WNT/β-Catenin signalling is required to induce expression of both , and "

We investigated the conformational equilibria of the human A, adenosine receptor (A,AR) in phospholipid vesicles using ,F solid-state magic angle spinning NMR (SSNMR).  By applying an optimized sample preparation workflow and experimental conditions, we were able to obtain ,F-SSNMR spectra for both antagonist- and agonist-bound complexes with sensitivity and line widths closely comparable to those achieved using solution NMR.

Coral bleaching is a well–known ramification of marine heatwaves, but rapid coral mortality is an emerging paradigm that visually manifests as the ′sloughing′ of tissue from the coral skeleton. Unlike coral bleaching, coral tissue sloughing precludes any prospect of holobiont recovery beyond the initial onset,, indicating a life–or–death tipping point. Here, we experimentally confirm this phenomenon occurs when temperatures increase within temporal windows of hours to days, consistent with field observations,. Through microscale measurements of dissolved oxygen in the diffusive boundary layers of two abundant, keystone reef–building corals, we demonstrate that rapid temperature increases coincide with intrinsic oxygen deprivation, occurring before gross tissue disintegration or coral tissue sloughing. We propose that this distinct phenomenon arises from rapid heating, rendering the coral holobiont incapable of engaging in reactive processes to counteract the combined effects of heightened aerobic demands and impaired photosynthetic function. The passive diffusion of O, from the surrounding bulk water is likely insufficient to meet the holobiont's requirements, as explained by the Einstein–Smoluchowski kinetic theory of gases and Brownian motion"

In organisms capable of whole body regeneration, considerable progress has been made identifying wound signals initiating this process, but the mechanisms that control the differentiation of progenitors into mature organs are not fully understood. Using the planarian as a model system, we identify a novel function for , a MAP3K family member possessing both kinase and ubiquitin ligase domains, to negatively regulate terminal differentiation of stem cells during eye regeneration. Inhibition of , caused the formation of multiple ectopic eyes within the head, but without controlling overall head, brain, or body patterning. By contrast, other known regulators of planarian eye patterning like , and , also regulate head regionalization, suggesting , acts distinctly. Eye resection and regeneration experiments suggest that unlike Wnt signaling perturbation, , inhibition did not shift the target destination of eye formation in the animal. Instead, , ectopic eyes emerge in the regions normally occupied by migratory eye progenitors, and the onset of ectopic eyes after , inhibition coincides with a reduction to eye progenitor numbers. Furthermore, RNAi dosing experiments indicate that progenitors closer to their normal target are relatively more sensitive to the effects of , implicating this factors in controlling the site of terminal differentiation.

While previous studies have provided structural insights into AE1 and its substrate binding, the conformational transitions and role of lipid interactions have remained elusive. In this study, we utilized cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to resolve three high resolution structure of distinct conformational states of AE1: two inward-facing (IF1 and IF2) and one outward-facing (OF). Furthermore, uptake assay revealed the modulatory effect of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP,) lipids on AE1. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted on these structures to capture anion binding and determine the anion binding sites in AE1. We then used a combination of advanced enhanced sampling techniques together with system-specific collective variables to study the OF⇐⇒IF transition in AE1 and provide refined pathways for the process in three different systems: apo, HCO,-bound, and an AE1 system in which cryo-EM determined interfacial PIP, lipids had been removed. These pathways were then used to calculate the free energy of the OF⇐⇒IF transition in AE1 under different conditions. The energies show how substrate binding reduces the energy barrier, and therefore facilitates the transport. Furthermore, they clearly capture the inhibitory effect of PIP, lipids at the dimer interface and provide a molecular mechanism for it. These results provide molecular-level understanding of the mechanistic basis for ion transport in AE1 and the regulatory role of PIP"
Developmental Biology,The ,"Colby K.,Victoria C.,Kenneth H.,Colby K.,Victoria C.,Kenneth H.,Colby K.,Victoria C.","Rapidly dividing cells can eliminate slow growing neighbors through the apoptotic process of cell competition. This process ensures that only high fitness cells populate embryonic tissues and is proposed to underlie the ability of oncogene-transformed cells to progressively replace normal cells within a tissue. Patches of cells in the , wing disc overexpressing the oncogenic Taiman (Tai) transcriptional coactivator kill normal neighbors by secreting Spz ligands that trigger pro-apoptotic Toll signaling in receiving cells. However, extracellular signaling mechanisms responsible for elimination of slow growing cells by normal neighbors remain poorly defined. Here we show that slow growing cells with reduced Tai (Tai,) are killed by normal neighbors through a mechanism involving competition for the Wingless (Wg/Wnt) ligand. Elevated Wg signaling significantly rescues elimination of Tai, cells in multiple organs, suggesting that Tai may normally promote Wg activity. Examining distribution of Wg components reveals that Tai promotes extracellular spread of the Wg ligand from source cells across the wing disc, thus ensuring patterned expression of multiple Wg-regulated target genes. Tai controls Wg spread indirectly through the extracellular glypican Dally-like protein (Dlp), which binds Wg and promotes its extracellular diffusion and capture by receptors. Data indicate that Tai likely controls Dlp at two levels: transcription of , mRNA and Dlp intracellular trafficking. Overall, these data indicate that the Tai acts through Dlp to enable Wg transport and signaling, and that cell competition in the Tai"

Remarkably, mutants closely resemble non-affected embryos from the previous day at all postimplantation stages examined.

The widely used quinolone class of drugs use a water-metal ion bridge in interacting with the GyrA subunit of DNA gyrase. Zoliflodacin sits in the same pocket as quinolones but interacts with the GyrB subunit and also stabilizes lethal double-stranded DNA-breaks. Gepotidacin had been observed to sit on the twofold axis of the complex, midway between the two four base-pair separated DNA-cleavage sites and has been observed to stabilize singe-stranded DNA-breaks. Here we use information from three crystal structures of complexes of , DNA gyrase (one with a precursor of gepotidacin and one with the progenitor of zoliflodacin) to propose a simple single moving metal-ion catalyzed DNA-cleavage mechanism.

Here, we introduce EuPRI (Eukaryotic Protein-RNA Interactions) — a freely available resource of RNA motifs for 34,736 RBPs from 690 eukaryotes. EuPRI includes , binding data for 504 RBPs, including newly collected RNAcompete data for 174 RBPs, along with thousands of reconstructed motifs. We reconstruct these motifs with a new computational platform — Joint Protein-Ligand Embedding (JPLE) — which can detect distant homology relationships and map specificity-determining peptides. EuPRI quadruples the number of known RBP motifs, expanding the motif repertoire across all major eukaryotic clades, and assigning motifs to the majority of human RBPs. EuPRI drastically improves knowledge of RBP motifs in flowering plants. For example, it increases the number of , RBP motifs 7-fold, from 14 to 105. EuPRI also has broad utility for inferring post-transcriptional function and evolutionary relationships. We demonstrate this by predicting a role for 12 "

Both target species were found to have small effective population sizes, low levels of genetic diversity, and minimal population structure around Guam. Nonetheless, , cf. , had significantly higher levels of genetic diversity, some population structure as well as more clones, close relatives and putative loci under selection. Comparisons with , cf. , indicate a potentially significant impact by habitat on population structure and genetic diversity while colony morphology seems to significantly impact clonality.

We tested this using two partially isolated populations of the red and green colour forms of ,, either uninfected or infected with different , strains, one inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility and the other not. We first investigated male and female preferences, and found that, in absence of infection, females were not choosy but all males preferred red-form females. , effects were more subtle, with only the CI-inducing strain slightly strengthening colour-form based preferences. We then performed a double-mating experiment to test how incompatible matings affect subsequent mating behaviour and offspring production, as compared to compatible matings. Females mated with an incompatible male (infected and/or heterotypic) were more attractive and/or receptive to subsequent (compatible) matings, although analyses of offspring production revealed no clear benefit for this re-mating behaviour (i.e., apparently unaltered first male sperm precedence). Finally, by computing the relative contributions of each reproductive barrier to total isolation, we showed that pre-mating isolation matches both host-associated and ,-induced post-mating isolation, suggesting that "

Genetics,A collection of split-Gal4 drivers targeting conserved signaling ligands in ,"Ben,Neha,Ashley Suraj,Tanuj,Jonathan,Norbert,Ben,Neha,Ashley Suraj,Tanuj,Jonathan,Norbert,Ben,Neha,Ashley Suraj,Tanuj,Jonathan","Communication between cells in metazoan organisms is mediated by a remarkably small number of highly conserved signaling pathways. Given the relatively small number of signaling pathways, the existence of multiple related ligands for many of these pathways is thought to represent a key evolutionary innovation for encoding complexity into cell-cell signaling. Relatedly, crosstalk and other interactions between pathways is another critical feature which allows a modest number pathways to ultimately generate an enormously diverse range of outcomes. It would thus be useful to have genetic tools to identify and manipulate not only those cells which express a given signaling ligand, but also those cells that specifically co-express pairs of signaling ligands. Here, we present a collection of split-Gal4 knock-in lines targeting many of the ligands for highly conserved signaling pathways in , (Notch, Hedgehog, FGF, EGF, TGF,, JAK/STAT, JNK, and PVR). We demonstrate that these lines faithfully recapitulate the endogenous expression pattern of their targets, and that they can be used to specifically identify the cells and tissues that co-express pairs of signaling ligands. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that the 4th chromosome TGF, ligands , and , are broadly co-expressed in muscles and other tissues of both larva and adults, and that the JAK/STAT ligands , and , are partially co-expressed from cells of the midgut following gut damage. Together with our previously collection of split-Gal4 lines targeting the seven Wnt ligands, this resource allows "

Currently, there are no disease-modifying therapies available for ALS4. Given that , is haplosufficient, removing the product of the mutated allele presents a potential therapeutic strategy. We designed a series of siRNAs to selectively target the RNA transcript from the ALS4 allele containing the c.1166T>C mutation (p.Leu389Ser). Transfection of HEK293 cells with siRNA and plasmids encoding either wild-type or mutant (Leu389Ser) epitope tagged SETX revealed that three siRNAs specifically reduced mutant SETX protein levels without affecting the wild-type SETX protein. In ALS4 primary fibroblasts, siRNA treatment silenced the endogenous mutant , allele, while sparing the wild-type allele, and restored R-loop levels in patient cells.

Mutations in the , gene are associated with psychiatric disorders but how RBFOX1 influences psychiatric disorder vulnerability remains unclear. Recent studies showed that RBFOX1 mediates the alternative splicing of ,, a critical HPA axis activator. Further, RBFOX1 dysfunction is linked to dysregulation of BDNF/TrkB, a pathway promoting neuroplasticity, neuronal survival, and stress resilience. Hence, RBFOX1 dysfunction may increase psychiatric disorder vulnerability via HPA axis dysregulation, leading to disrupted development and allostatic overload. To test this hypothesis, we generated a zebrafish , loss of function (LoF) line and examined behavioural and molecular effects during development. In larvae and adults, , LoF resulted in hyperactivity, impulsivity and hyperarousal, and alterations in proliferation, fertility and survival, traits associated with allostatic overload. In larvae, , LoF disrupted expression of ,, and HPI axis genes. These latter were restored after chronic TrkB agonist/antagonist treatment.

Genomic data can provide insights into the adaptation of invasive species through Genotype-Environment Association (GEA) studies, identifying genes and biological processes associated with invasion success, and more globally to estimate genetic (mal)adaptation to new environments by calculating Genomic Offset (GO) statistics. In this study, we investigate genetic adaptation in the invasive crop pest , using novel genomic resources and statistical methods. We rely on a new chromosome-level genome assembly and a dataset representing 36 populations, combining both publicly available and newly generated pooled and individual sequencing data, which are analyzed using an enhanced version of the BayPass software, tailored for such hybrid datasets. We identify a limited number of genomic regions associated with invasion success, supporting the hypothesis of a polygenic architecture of the underlying adaptive traits. Using a GEA incorporating 28 environmental covariates, we further estimate GO between source environments and invaded areas to gain insight into the adaptive challenges faced by , during past invasions. Reciprocally, we estimate GO between putative source environments and geographic areas that have not yet been invaded to predict regions at risk for potential future invasions. Finally, we used GO calculation to identify high risk regions from which pre-adapted populations could likely originate. Our results suggest that the adaptive challenge for , populations to invade their current major invasion range was limited. We also identified uninvaded regions (in Africa, South America, and Australia) as being at high risk of future invasion. While further sampling and more extensive individual sequencing could refine these conclusions, our study provides important insights into "

Here, we focus on a diseased site (Freycinet Peninsula, Tasmania, Australia) with 18 years of continuous mark-recapture data to test: (,) whether rates of precocial breeding in females continued to increase after the initial rise after the emergence of the disease, (,) whether there was a relationship between body size and breeding success for either one-year-olds or adult females (i.e., at least two-years-old), and ("

S.,Alexander D.,Roland,Alberto","Seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) are essential for reproductive success and evolve fast, possibly driven by post-copulatory sexual selection (PCSS) originating from sperm competition and cryptic female choice. Counterintuitively, however, the coding region only in few Sfps evolves adaptively. Hence, additional genomic and functional factors must play a role in Sfp evolution independent of the protein coding region. To shed light on drivers of Sfp evolution we focus on those Sfps predominantly expressed in male accessory glands, because this allows examination of their evolution in the tissue which produces the majority of Sfps. Moreover, accessory glands develop normally in hybrids in contrast to testis allowing to control for changes in cellular environment arising during speciation. Here, we discover that Acp promoters contain hot spots for rapid evolution from accumulation of sequence changes and insertions/deletions (indels). We further show that changes in promoter sequences are accompanied by gene expression divergence among closely related , species. We then validate these observations in "

Epidemiology,Cohort-based smoothing methods for age-specific contact rates,"Yannick,Oswaldo,Christel,Carlo G.,Niel,Yannick,Oswaldo,Christel,Carlo G.,Niel,Yannick,Oswaldo,Christel,Carlo G.","The use of social contact rates is widespread in infectious disease modeling since it has been shown that they are key driving forces of important epidemiological parameters. Quantification of contact patterns is crucial to parametrize dynamic transmission models and to provide insights on the (basic) reproduction number. Information on social interactions, can (for instance) be obtained from population-based contact surveys, such as the European Commission project POLYMOD. Estimation of age-specific contact rates from these studies is often done using a piecewise constant approach or bivariate smoothing techniques. For the latter, typically, smoothing is done in the dimensions of the respondent’s and contact’s age. We propose a new flexible strategy based on a smoothing constrained approach - taking into account the reciprocal nature of contacts - where the contact rates are assumed smooth from a cohort perspective as well as from the age distribution of contacts. This is achieved by smoothing over the diagonal components (including all subdiagonals) of the social contact matrix. This approach is supported by the fact that people age with time and thus motivates smoothly varying contact rates from a cohort angle. Two approaches that allow for smoothing of social contact data over cohorts are proposed namely, (1) reordering of the diagonal components of the social contact matrix; and (2) reordering of the penalty matrix associated with the diagonal components. Parameter estimation is done in the likelihood framework by using constrained penalized iterative reweighted least squares (C-PIRLS), under Poisson and negative Binomial distributional assumptions for the observed contacts. A simulation study underlines the benefits of cohort-based smoothing based on two scalar measures of performance. Finally, the proposed methods are illustrated on the Belgian POLYMOD data of 2006.

Ecology,Functional and evolutionary characterization of potential auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) of the global RNA virome,"Yang,Zhihao,Pengfei,Meiling,Rong,Yongqin,Yang,Zhihao,Pengfei,Meiling,Rong,Yongqin,Yang,Zhihao,Pengfei,Meiling,Rong","RNA viruses play an important role in regulating their host and global biogeochemical cycling, and auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) are one of the main pathways by which viruses regulate hosts metabolism. However, the AMGs encoded by global RNA viruses are largely unexplored. Here, we annotated RNA viral genomes and identified AMGs from recently published global RNA virome datasets. We found 274 AMGs encoded by 243 RNA viral genomes, which accounts for only 0.008% of all 3,216,257 genomes investigated. These AMGs span 25 functional categories, the most prevalent being translation, energy metabolism, membrane transport, transcription, replication and repair, and signal transduction. Unlike DNA viruses, RNA viruses tend to encode AMGs influencing the genetic and environments information processing of their hosts, with fewer AMGs linked to nutrient cycling, such as carbon and nitrogen metabolism. In addition, RNA viruses encoding these AMGs were taxonomically diverse, spanning five established phyla, the newly proposed phylum ""Taraviricota"" and fourteen LucaProt supergroups. Host prediction indicated that most of these RNA viruses encoding AMGs infect eukaryotes, while only a few of them, including , and "

Nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplementation ameliorates metabolic dysfunction in rodents. We aimed to establish whether oral NR supplementation in aged participants can increase the skeletal muscle NAD, metabolome, and questioned if tissue NAD, levels are depressed with aging. We supplemented 12 aged men with NR 1g per day for 21-days in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. Targeted metabolomics showed that NR elevated the muscle NAD, metabolome, evident by increased nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide and nicotinamide clearance products. Muscle RNA sequencing revealed NR-mediated downregulation of energy metabolism and mitochondria pathways. NR also depressed levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines. In an additional study, ,P magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based NAD, measurement in muscle and brain showed no difference between young and aged individuals. Our data establish that oral NR is available to aged human muscle and identify anti-inflammatory effects of NR, while suggesting that NAD, decline is not associated with chronological aging "

However, their direct effects on insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells remain largely unexplored. This study investigates the impact of β-blockers on insulin secretion utilizing MIN6-K8 clonal β-cells and mouse islets in vitro. Various non-selective and β1-selective β-blockers were found to amplify glucose- and glimepiride-induced insulin secretion 1.5-2 fold. Surprisingly, some of the β-blockers (propranolol and bisoprolol) were found to increase cAMP production 5-10 fold via adenylyl cyclase, the effects being dependent on α2-adrenoceptors, which suggests cross-reactivity of these β-blockers and their receptors. Propranolol-stimulated insulin secretion involves a novel signaling pathway mediated by protein kinase A (PKA), ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 5 (TRPM5). Initially, cAMP activates PKA and triggers RYR2 phosphorylation and extracellular Ca, influx, leading to Ca,-induced Ca, release (CICR). Subsequently, CICR activates TRPM5, resulting in augmented extracellular Ca, influx through the L-type voltage-dependent Ca"

However, few eye tracking studies have compared the relative efficacy of different paradigms to discriminate between autistic compared with typically developing children and their sensitivity to specific symptoms. To target this issue, the current study used three common eye tracking protocols contrasting social versus non-social stimuli in young (2-7 years old) Chinese autistic (n = 35) and typically developing (n = 34) children matched for age and gender. Protocols included dancing people ,. dynamic geometrical images, biological motion (dynamic light point walking human or cat) ,. non-biological motion (scrambled controls) and child playing with toy ,. toy alone. Although all three paradigms differentiated autistic and typically developing children, the dancing people versus dynamic geometry pattern paradigm was the most effective, with autistic children showing marked reductions in visual preference for dancing people and correspondingly increased one for geometric patterns. Furthermore, this altered visual preference in autistic children was correlated with the ADOS social affect score and had the highest discrimination accuracy. Our results therefore indicate that decreased visual preference for dynamic social stimuli may be the most effective visual attention-based paradigm for use as a biomarker for autism in Chinese children.

Here we examined a commercial cognitive training program (,) in a 5-week double-blind, pseudo-randomized placebo-controlled trial. Based on a priori power analysis, we recruited 99 healthy older adults 59-91 years of age (M = 68.87, SD = 6.31; 69 women), assigning them to either the intervention or an active control program (Sudoku and n-back working memory exercises). We subdivided both groups into high and low expectation priming conditions, to probe for effects of participants’ expectations on training and transfer. We assessed transfer using a battery of standard neuropsychological and psychosocial measures that had been agreed to by the training program developers. We planned and pre-registered our analyses (on osf.io). The majority (88%) of participants progressed through the training, and most provided positive feedback about it. Similarly, the majority (80%) of participants believed they were truly training their brains. Yet, transfer of training was minimal. Also minimal were any effects of expectations on training and transfer, although participants who received high expectation priming tended to engage more with their assigned program overall. Our findings suggest limited benefits of "

Developmental Biology,Independent control of neurogenesis and dorsoventral patterning by NKX2-2,"Sumin,Elena,Julie,Hynek,Sumin,Elena,Julie,Hynek,Sumin,Elena,Julie","Human neurogenesis is disproportionately protracted, lasting >10 times longer than in mouse, allowing neural progenitors to undergo more rounds of self-renewing cell divisions and generate larger neuronal populations. In the human spinal cord, expansion of the motor neuron lineage is achieved through a newly evolved progenitor domain called vpMN (ventral motor neuron progenitor) that uniquely extends and expands motor neurogenesis. This behavior of vpMNs is controlled by transcription factor NKX2-2, which in vpMNs is co-expressed with classical motor neuron progenitor (pMN) marker OLIG2. In this study, we sought to determine the molecular basis of NKX2-2-mediated extension and expansion of motor neurogenesis. We found that NKX2-2 represses proneural gene , by two distinct, Notch-independent mechanisms that are respectively apparent in rodent and human spinal progenitors: in rodents (and chick), NKX2-2 represses , and the motor neuron lineage through its tinman domain, leading to loss of , expression. In human vpMNs, however, NKX2-2 represses , but not ,, thereby allowing motor neurogenesis to proceed, albeit in a delayed and protracted manner. Interestingly, we found that ectopic expression of tinman-mutant , in mouse pMNs phenocopies human vpMNs, repressing , but not ,, and leading to delayed and protracted motor neurogenesis. Our studies identify a Notch- and tinman-independent mode of ,-mediated , repression that is observed in human spinal progenitors, but is normally masked in rodents and chicks due to ,’s tinman-dependent repression of "

Compared to existing methods, real-time detection and long-term monitoring are still required. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have excellent optical properties for sensing applications, which provide the possibility for designing a new generation of glucose sensors. In this study, we describe a method for covalently conjugate glucose oxidase (GOx) on SWCNTs as an optical glucose sensor. The functional groups are introduced by a photocatalytic reaction which acts as the handle for protein loading on SWCNTs. In this sp3 defect reaction, the optical properties of SWCNTs can be maintained. With a convenient bioconjugation reaction, the GOx could be covalently linked with SWCNTs. Compared to the non-covalent immobilization conjugates, the covalent conjugate sensor exhibits a much stronger optical response toward glucose, and the stability of the biosensor also increases in harsh conditions. At the same time, we also report the changing ratio of the original E, and defected E"

Nonetheless, the specific molecular target and mechanism of action of SSRIs remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we reveal that citalopram exerts an immune-dependent anti-tumor effects in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Interestingly, the anti-HCC effects of citalopram are not reliant on its conventional target, the serotonin transporter. Through various drug repurposing approaches, including global reverse gene expression profiling, drug affinity responsive target stability assay, and molecular docking, the complement component 5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) is identified as a new target of citalopram. C5aR1 is predominantly expressed by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and citalopram treatment enhances local macrophage phagocytosis and elicits CD8, T anti-tumor immunity. At a systemic level, citalopram treatment results in decreased serum 5-HT levels, which correlates with increased activation of CD8, T cells. Additionally, citalopram promotes αCD3/αCD28-stimulated CD8, T cell activation, expansion, and cytotoxicity. Depletion of CD8"

Benzylsuccinate synthase (BSS) catalyzes the enantiospecific formation of ,-benzylsuccinate from toluene and fumarate, initiating anaerobic toluene degradation. In this study, we present a detailed theoretical study of the reaction mechanism using classical molecular dynamics and multiscale modelling (QM:MM). We describe the potential energy surface of the reaction, confirming the previously postulated mechanism. However, the multiscale character of our model allowed to elucidate the origins of several experimentally observed catalytic phenomena, such as the inversion of the configuration of the benzylic atom upon C-C bond formation, syn addition of the abstracted H atom back to the benzylsuccinyl radical, or kinetic isotope effects in the range of 1.7-2.1. The obtained model is supported by microkinetic analysis and was able to explain and quantitatively predict the strict ,-enantioselectivity of BSS, which is not enforced by the binding orientation of the fumarate, but by dynamic kinetic behaviour of toluene in the active site leading to faster production of the R-enantiomer. We were also able to explain the experimentally observed slow H/D exchange in the product during incubation with BSS in D"

Physiology,Endurance exercise with reduced muscle glycogen content influences substrate utilization and attenuates acute mTORC1- and autophagic signaling in human type I and type II muscle fibers,"Oscar,Lucas,Henrik,Marcus,Sebastian,Karin,Antonio,Jorge,Eva,Oscar,Lucas,Henrik,Marcus,Sebastian,Karin,Antonio,Jorge,Eva,Oscar,Lucas,Henrik,Marcus,Sebastian,Karin,Antonio,Jorge","Background: Exercising with low muscle glycogen content can improve training adaptation, but the mechanisms underlying the muscular adaptation are still largely unknown. In this study, we measured substrate utilization and cell signaling in different muscle fiber types during exercise and investigated a possible link between these variables.
Methods: Five subjects performed a single leg cycling exercise in the evening (day 1) with the purpose of reducing glycogen stores. The following morning (day 2), they performed two-legged cycling at ~70% of VO, for 1h. Muscle biopsies were taken from both legs pre- and post-exercise for enzymatic analyses of glycogen, metabolite concentrations using LC-MS/MS-based quantification, and protein signaling using Western blot in pools of type I or type II fibers. 
Results: Glycogen content was 60-65% lower for both fiber types (P<0.01) in the leg that exercised on day 1 (low leg) compared to the other leg with normal level of glycogen (normal leg) before the cycling exercise on day 2. Glycogen utilization during exercise was significantly less in both fiber types in the low compared to the normal leg (P<0.05). In the low leg, there was a 14- and 6-fold increase in long-chain fatty acids conjugated to carnitine in type I and type II fibers, respectively, post-exercise. This increase was 3-4 times larger than in the normal leg (P<0.05). Post-exercise, mTOR, phosphorylation was increased in both fiber types in the normal leg (P<0.05) but remained unchanged in both fiber types in the low leg together with an increase in eEF2"

Currently, there is no treatment for NPC. Transcription factor EB (TFEB), a member of the microphthalmia transcriptional factors (MiTF), has emerged as a master regulator of lysosomal function, promoting the clearance of substrates stored in cells. However, it is not known whether TFEB plays a role in cholesterol clearance in NPC disease. Here, we show that transgenic overexpression of TFEB, but not TFE3 (another member of MiTF family) facilitates cholesterol clearance in NPC1 cell models. Here we show that pharmacological activation of TFEB by sulforaphane (SFN), a previously identified natural small-molecule TFEB agonist by us, can dramatically ameliorate cholesterol accumulation in human and mouse NPC1 cell models. In NPC1 cells, SFN induces TFEB nuclear translocation and upregulates the expression of TFEB-downstream genes, promoting lysosomal exocytosis and biogenesis. While genetic inhibition of TFEB abolishes the cholesterol clearance and exocytosis effect by SFN. In the NPC mouse model, SFN dephosphorylates/activates TFEB in brain and exhibits potent "

We identified a novel group of Tn7-like transposons in Cyanobacteria that preferentially target CRISPR arrays, suggesting a new functional interaction between these elements and CRISPR-Cas systems. Using bioinformatics tools, we characterized their phylogeny, target specificity, and sub-specialization. The array-targeting elements are phylogenetically close to tRNA-targeting elements. The distinct target preference coincides with loss of a C-terminal region in the TnsD protein which is responsible for recognizing target sites when compared to closely related elements. Notably, elements are found integrated into a fixed position within CRISPR spacer regions, a behavior that might minimize negative impacts on the host defense system. These transposons were identified in both plasmid and genomic CRISPR arrays, indicating that their preferred target provides a means for both safe insertion in the host chromosome and a mechanism for dissemination.

High Cas9 activity is essential for efficient gene editing to generate gene deletions and gene replacements by homologous recombination. However, cleavage efficiency is below 50% for more than half of randomly selected sgRNA sequences in human cell culture screens or model organisms. We used in vitro assays to determine intrinsic molecular parameters for maximal sgRNA activity including correct folding of sgRNAs and Cas9 structural information. From comparison of over 10 data sets, we find major constraints in sgRNA design originating from defective secondary structure of the sgRNA, sequence context of the seed region, GC context and detrimental motifs, but we also find considerable variation among different prediction tools when applied to different data sets. To aid selection of efficient sgRNAs, we developed web-based PlatinumCRISPr, an sgRNA design tool to evaluate base-pairing and sequence composition parameters for optimal design of highly efficient sgRNAs for Cas9 genome editing named PlatinumCRISPr.

However, little is known about the molecular basis of this adaptation. Here, we characterize the evolution of a protein interaction network within the PIWI-interacting small RNA (piRNA) genome defence pathway in , at unprecedented scale and evolutionary resolution. We uncover pervasive rapid evolution of a protein interaction network anchored at the Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) paralog Rhino. Using complementary phylogenetic analysis, high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid matrix screening, and , interaction analyses in cross-species transgenic flies, we characterized three distinct evolutionary protein interaction trajectories across ~40 million years of , evolution. The data set covering 11 piRNA pathway proteins of five , species revealed several protein interactions that are fully conserved, indicating functional conservation despite overall rapid amino acid sequence change. Other interactions are preserved through co-evolution and were detected only between proteins within or from closely related species. We also identified sets of species-restricted protein interactions which, through rewiring of a Rhino-anchored transcription factor network, may preserve critical roles in enabling and adapting piRNA production from heterochromatic loci. In sum, our analyses dissected principles of interaction evolution in an adaptively evolving protein-protein interaction network uncovering evolutionary and functional insight into germline piRNA production across "

One such behaviour is oscillation, which underpins many essential biological functions. In this paper, energy-based modelling of biochemical systems using the bond graph approach is combined with classical feedback control theory to give a novel approach to the analysis, and potentially synthesis, of biochemical oscillators. It is shown that oscillation is dependent on the interplay between , and , feedback and this interplay is formalised using classical frequency-response analysis of feedback systems.

To predict community function and composition beyond statistical correlations, one can use genome-scale metabolic models. However, comprehensive model analysis via metabolic pathways is a major challenge because pathway counts grow combinatorially with model size. Here, we define minimal pathways that yield compact representations of metabolic network capabilities. They generalize existing pathway concepts by allowing inhomogeneous constraints and targeted analysis of subnetworks, and we show how to enumerate and sample them efficiently via iterative minimization and pathway graphs. This enables applications such as assessing quantitative gene essentiality in the central metabolism of "

Aphids are one of the biggest group of ectotherms that transmit viruses to plants; more than 200 species have been identified as pathogen vectors. These aphids are responsible for transmitting over 300 viruses. The life-history traits of aphids such as fecundity and survival respond strongly and non-linearly to temperature and therefore to global warming. In this study, we elaborate the thermal responses for the main life-history traits (i.e, development and mortality rate) for aphid species for which data were available or generated. Also, thermal responses for virus transmission rates were elaborated to describe plant host to vector and vector to plant host dynamics. With these data, we elaborated thermal suitability models which were used to map current and projected scenarios for the transmission of viruses by aphids. Data was only available/generated for 19 aphid species, many of which only have data either at the lower or upper thermal limits. For virus transmission rates, from host plant to vector and from vector to plant data was only available/generated for potato virus Y (PVY), potato virus A (PVA), and potato leaf roll virus (PLRV) transmitted by the aphid "

Sesame yield improvement using molecular-biotechnological tools involving gene manipulation is a better alternative than traditional breeding because it requires less time, effort, and labour. Protoplasts are plant cells devoid of the cell wall. Protoplast systems are deployed as versatile cell-based tools for tissue culture, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenetics studies leading to crop improvement. Inadequate reports of sesame protoplasts restrict its potential use in this crop. In the present study, we are reporting the successful isolation and purification of sesame protoplasts from four different sesame explants: hypocotyl, internode, leaf, and hypocotyl-derived callus using the one-step enzymatic digestion method. We have carefully optimised enzyme combinations, digestion durations, temperatures, and shaking speeds for every tested explant to obtain the highest protoplast yield and viability.

Cell Biology,Mammary Epithelial Migration is EMT-Independent,"Jing,Rongze,Zhixuan,Yunzhe,Jiecan,Kun,Ophir D,Pengfei,Jing,Rongze,Zhixuan,Yunzhe,Jiecan,Kun,Ophir D,Pengfei,Jing,Rongze,Zhixuan,Yunzhe,Jiecan,Kun,Ophir D","Epithelial tissues are traditionally considered immobile, requiring epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) for individual or collective cell migration as mesenchymal cells. However, recent studies indicate that the mammary epithelium migrates via mechanisms distinct from mesenchymal collectives. Here, we demonstrate that mammary epithelium does not undergo EMT before migration, as evidenced by cellular and molecular characteristics, including EMT marker expression at the mRNA, protein, localization, and transcriptomic levels. Contrary to established models, cell-cell adhesion is not diminished but is required for epithelial migration. Furthermore, Snail1 does not repress cell-cell adhesion but instead plays a pivotal role in directing epithelial migration by regulating processes such as the directional movement of individual cells via Cdc42ep5. Our findings reveal the existence of both stationary and migratory states within the epithelium, providing new insights into how epithelial tissues transition between these states, with broad implications for organogenesis and cancer biology."
Genetics,Multiplexed Assays of Human Disease-relevant Mutations Reveal UTR Dinucleotide Composition as a Major Determinant of RNA Stability,"Jia-Ying,Yun-Lin,Yu-Tung,Yu-Chi,Cheng-Han,YoonSoon,Yen-Tsung,Chien-Ling,Jia-Ying,Yun-Lin,Yu-Tung,Yu-Chi,Cheng-Han,YoonSoon,Yen-Tsung,Chien-Ling,Jia-Ying,Yun-Lin,Yu-Tung,Yu-Chi,Cheng-Han,YoonSoon,Yen-Tsung","UTRs contain crucial regulatory elements for RNA stability, translation and localization, so their integrity is indispensable for gene expression. Approximately 3.7% of genetic variants associated with diseases occur in UTRs, yet a comprehensive understanding of UTR variant functions remains limited due to inefficient experimental and computational assessment methods. To systematically evaluate the effects of UTR variants on RNA stability, we established a massively parallel reporter assay on 6,555 UTR variants reported in human disease databases. We examined the RNA degradation patterns mediated by the UTR library in two cell lines, and then applied LASSO regression to model the influential regulators of RNA stability. We found that UA dinucleotides and UA-rich motifs are the most prominent destabilizing element. Gain of UA dinucleotide outlined mutant UTRs with reduced stability. Studies on endogenous transcripts indicate that high UA-dinucleotide ratios in UTRs promote RNA degradation. Conversely, elevated GC content and protein binding on UA dinucleotides protect high-UA RNA from degradation. Further analysis reveals polarized roles of UA-dinucleotide-binding proteins in RNA protection and degradation. Furthermore, the UA-dinucleotide ratio of both UTRs is a common characteristic of genes in innate immune response pathways, implying a coordinated stability regulation through UTRs at the transcriptomic level. We also demonstrate that stability-altering UTRs are associated with changes in biobank-based health indices, underscoring the importance of precise UTR regulation for wellness. Our study highlights the importance of RNA stability regulation through UTR primary sequences, paving the way for further exploration of their implications in gene networks and precision medicine."
Cell Biology,Neutrophils exhibit distinct migration phenotypes that are modulated by transendothelial migration,"Amy B.,Adithan,Juan C.,Yi-Ting,Amy B.,Adithan,Juan C.,Yi-Ting,Amy B.,Adithan,Juan C.","The extravasation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) is a critical component of the innate immune response that involves transendothelial migration (TEM) and interstitial migration. TEM-mediated interactions between PMNs and vascular endothelial cells (VECs) trigger a cascade of biochemical and mechanobiological signals whose effects on interstitial migration are currently unclear. To address this question, we cultured human VECs on a fibronectin-treated transwell insert to model the endothelium and basement membrane, loaded PMN-like differentiated HL60 (dHL-60) cells in the upper chamber of the insert, and collected the PMNs that crossed the membrane-supported monolayer from the lower chamber. The 3D chemotactic migration of the TEM-conditioned PMNs through collagen matrices was then quantified. Data collected from over 50,000 trajectories showed two distinct migratory phenotypes, i.e., a high-persistence phenotype and a low-persistence phenotype. These phenotypes were conserved across treatment conditions, and their existence was confirmed in human primary PMNs. The high-persistence phenotype was characterized by more straight trajectories and faster migration speeds, whereas the low-persistence one exhibited more frequent sharp turns and loitering periods. A key finding of our study is that TEM induced a phenotypic shift in PMNs from high-persistence migration to low-persistence migration. Changes in the relative proportion of high-persistence and low-persistence populations correlated with GRK2 expression levels. Inhibiting GRK2 hindered the TEM-induced shift in migratory phenotype and impaired the phagocytic function of PMNs. Overall, our study suggests that TEM-mediated GRK2 signaling primes PMNs for a migration phenotype better suited for spatial exploration and inflammation resolution. These observations provide novel insight into the biophysical impacts of TEM that priming PMNs is essential to conduct sentinel functions."
Biochemistry,The ATP-dependent protease ClpYQ degrades cell division proteins DivIVA and Mbl in Bacillus subtilis,"Taylor D.,Michael G.,Jordan T.,Puneet,Christopher N.,Taylor D.,Michael G.,Jordan T.,Puneet,Christopher N.,Taylor D.,Michael G.,Jordan T.,Puneet","ATP-dependent proteases play key roles in bacterial protein quality control and regulation of cellular processes. ClpYQ and ClpXP are ATP-dependent proteases in the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis. To date, no substrate proteins of B. subtilis ClpYQ have been characterized.  The protease component encoded by clpQ is synthetically lethal with clpP and the two genes are non-essential individually, suggesting potentially redundant roles for ClpYQ and ClpXP. Previous quantitative proteomic data predicted that B. subtilis proteins DivIVA and Mbl, components of the divisome and elongasome respectively, are potential substrates of ClpYQ. The role of DivIVA and Mbl in cell division and elongation suggests a significant role of ClpYQ in regulating cell division through targeted degradation of key divisome and elongasome proteins. Here we confirm that DivIVA and Mbl are degraded by ClpYQ both in vitro and in vivo, and thus identify the first two substrates of ClpYQ in B. subtilis."
Cell Biology,A limbal stem cell deficiency murine model with residual limbal stem cells,"Hideaki,Shintaro,Margarete M,Meredith S,Reza,Bruce R,Hideaki,Shintaro,Margarete M,Meredith S,Reza,Bruce R,Hideaki,Shintaro,Margarete M,Meredith S,Reza","Bilateral limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) is a significant cause of corneal blindness and is more difficult to treat, as compared with unilateral LSCD because no source of autologous limbal stem cells (LSCs) remains in these patients. Thus, bilateral patients could be candidates for treatment with allogeneic LSC transplants that require long-term systemic immunosuppression therapy. Thus, if possible, for the correct candidates, using autologous LSCs could be a preferred treatment. Recent in vivo laser confocal microscopic examination of the ocular surface in situ, combined with impression cytology, has indicated that some patients diagnosed with a complete bilateral LSCD possess residual LSCs. However, it remains unknown whether these residual LSCs still have stem cell potential due to the lack of animal models that mimic this pathology. The goal of the current study is to make a complete LSCD model that possesses evidence of residual LSCs. We induced complete LSCD in mice using two methods: (1) removed the corneal epithelium and the epithelial basement membrane using a rotating burr, and (2) removed the corneal epithelium using 20% ethanol but retained an intact epithelial basement membrane. A complete LSCD was defined by a lack of CK12-positive corneal epithelial cells and the presence of infiltrating CK19-positive conjunctival epithelial cells. Corneas were examined for wound closure, corneal opacity, LSC exhaustion, and inflammation. We observed that complete LSCD mice without an intact epithelial basement membrane resulted in few residual LSCs. By contrast, complete LSCD mice that retained the epithelial basement membrane were accompanied by a reduced inflammatory response plus a significant number of residual LSCs. This model will allow future studies to determine the function of residual LSCs in complete LSCD."

They constitutively produce different kinds of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which mediate cell-to cell communication and play diverse roles in immune regulation and inflammatory processes. Here we provide a resource documenting the composition of activated TH cell EVs and demonstrating their ability to instigate pro-inflammatory response in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). EVs were characterized by lipidomics, proteomics, and NanoFCM. The activated TH cells derived EVs (act-EVs) were found to be enriched in TH cell-specific proteins, transmembrane and cytosolic EV marker proteins, and HLA proteins relative to resting CD4 T cells EVs (rest-EVs). The pro-inflammatory effect of act-EVs vs rest-EVs on donor matched APCs were characterized by chemokine and cytokine profiling and flow cytometry analysis. There was no discernible contrast in endotoxin levels between act-EVs and rest-EVs. Functional distinctions were seen to arise from variations in the content and composition of these EVs. Moreover, we validated our findings with an in-vivo investigation in mice, demonstrating the recruitment of monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils, and NK cells in the spleen, accompanied by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum after administering act-EVs. In summary, this study sheds light on the role of TH cell released EVs in modulating the immune response during pro-inflammatory responses and this resource provides a foundation for development of novel therapeutics on EV based scaffolds."

Here we have used BCR receptor cloning and expression together with single-cell transcriptomics to analyze the B cell repertoire to the ubiquitous N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) epitope in human cohorts and dissect the immune phylogeny of this predominant class of antibodies. We find that circulating anti-GlcNAc B cells exhibiting canonical BMem phenotypes emerge rapidly after birth and couple this observation with evidence for germinal center-dependent affinity maturation of carbohydrate-specific B cell receptors in situ during early childhood. Direct analysis of individual B cell clonotypes reveals they exhibit strikingly distinct fine-specificity profiles for palettes of GlcNAc containing moieties. These results suggest that a generalized exposure to complex environmental glycans drives the steady state anti-glycan repertoire."

Design: Laboratory based experiments with female mice. Animals: Female congenic (fully backcrossed) and non-congenic (mixed strain) mice with CD4 T cell-specific RGS2 knockout. Exposure: Four-week-old female CD4 RGS2 knockout (CD4 RGS2KO) mice and their littermate controls (CD4 RGS2CTL) were subjected to superovulation using pregnant mare serum gonadotropins. Main Outcome Measures: Oocyte numbers, lymphocyte populations in the ovary and uterus, and serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations. Results: In non-congenic (mixed strain) mice, CD4 RGS2 knockout (KO) promoted higher oocyte ovulation and increased uterine total leukocyte numbers. Similarly, congenic (fully backcrossed strain) mice showed higher oocyte numbers and increased uterine total leukocytes in the CD4 RGS2KO mice compared to CD4 RGS2CTL mice. Pro-inflammatory CD4+ T helper (TH) 1 and TH17 cell frequencies in the ovary and uterus were unchanged, while Treg and TH2 cell frequencies were elevated, along with increased concentrations of estradiol and progesterone in the serum of CD4 RGS2KO mice. Conclusion: Our study highlights the important role of RGS2 in CD4+ T cells within the context of reproduction. The dysregulation of immune responses due to RGS2 knockout in CD4+ T cells appears to enhance oocyte production. Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which RGS2 influences reproductive outcomes, including its impact on fecundability, endometrial receptivity, and successful implantation."

Previously, we reported the discovery of ASOs that target a novel, putative intronic RNA structure to rescue splicing of multiple pathogenic variants of F8 exon 16 that cause hemophilia A. However, the conventional approach to discovering splice-modulating ASOs is both laborious and expensive. Here, we describe an alternative paradigm that integrates data-driven RNA structure prediction and community science to discover splice-modulating ASOs. Using a splicing-deficient pathogenic variant of F8 exon 16 as a model, we show that 25% of the top-scoring molecules designed in the Eterna OpenASO challenge have a statistically significant impact on enhancing exon 16 splicing. Additionally, we show that a distinct combination of ASOs designed by Eterna players can additively enhance the inclusion of the splicing-deficient exon 16 variant. Together, our data suggests that crowdsourcing designs from a community of citizen scientists may accelerate the discovery of splice-modulating ASOs with potential to treat human disease."

Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine implicated in ILC2 activation, was constitutively expressed in villus telocytes and crypt-associated trophocytes, specialized fibroblasts that sustain epithelial identity. Feeding increased TSLP and induced ILC2 type 2 cytokines that were attenuated by deletion of TSLP in PDGFRa+ stromal cells or TSLP receptor on ILC2s. Mouse and human telocytes expressed receptors for glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), which is released by enteroendocrine cells (EECs) after eating. GLP-2 induced intestinal TSLP, TSLP-dependent ILC2 cytokine production, and tuft cell hyperplasia.

However, recent reports have shown that some TRIMs lack detectable ubiquitination activity in isolation, despite containing a RING domain. Here, we present parallel in cellulo, in vitro, and in silico structure-function analyses of the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and RING domain structural characteristics of whole TRIM protein family. In-depth follow-up studies of this comprehensive dataset reveals a number of pseudoligases, whose RING domains have structurally diverged at either the homodimerisation or E2~ubiquitin interfaces, thereby disrupting their ability to catalyse ubiquitin transfer. Together, these data raise intriguing open questions regarding the unknown TRIM functions in physiology and disease."

Here we report the structure and function of a bacterial WTAs rhamnosyltransferase, RmlT, strictly required for , WTAs rhamnosylation. In particular, we demonstrated that RmlT transfers rhamnose from dTDP-L-rhamnose to naked WTAs, and that specificity towards TDP-rhamnose is not determined by its binding affinity. Structures of RmlT with and without its substrates showed that this enzyme is a dimer, revealed the residues responsible for interaction with the substrates and that the catalytic residue pre-orients the acceptor substrate towards the nucleophilic attack to the sugar. Additionally, the structures provided indications for two potential interaction pathways for the long WTAs on the surface of RmlT. Finally, we confirmed that WTAs glycosyltransferases are promising targets for next-generation strategies against Gram-positive pathogens by showing that inactivation of the RmlT catalytic activity results in a decreased infection ,."

For example, in uniaxially stretched tissue most divisions orient along the stretch axis. This mechanosensitive division orientation can be achieved by distinct mechanisms involving a direct response to force or an indirect response to force via cell shape changes. Cells also generally align divisions along their long axis of interphase shape. Since stretching a tissue elongates cells, uncoupling whether divisions orient in response to force or to cell shape remains challenging. Here, we utilised the Xenopus laevis embryonic animal cap tissue, to which a reproducible external stretch can be applied, to understand mechanosensitive division orientation. We focused on nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA), which is key to spindle orientation. We show that NuMA is dynamically localised to the cell cortex earlier during mitosis in uniaxially stretched tissues. This temporal cortical recruitment of NuMA coincides with the onset and subsequent stretch-induced amplification of spindle oscillations. Additionally, we show that knockdown of NuMA reduces spindle oscillations and disrupts division orientation according to stretch and cell shape. We also show that divisions dynamically align with cell shape under tissue stretch and that this involves a direct response to force via NuMA localisation, rather than an indirect response to force via cell shape changes. Overall, using live tissue imaging, mathematical modelling, and tissue mechanics our results indicate that NuMA fine tunes spindle dynamics and ensures the accurate alignment of divisions with cell shape and anisotropic tension."

Building on our prior research establishing nuclear speckles as a pivotal membrane-less organelle responsible for global proteostasis transcriptional control, we aim to alleviate proteinopathies through nuclear speckle rejuvenation. We identified pyrvinium pamoate as a small-molecule nuclear speckle rejuvenator that enhances protein quality control while suppressing YAP1 signaling via decreasing the surface/interfacial tension of nuclear speckle condensates through interaction with the intrinsically disordered region of nuclear speckle scaffold protein SON. In pre-clinical models, nanomolar pyrvinium pamoate alleviated retina degeneration and reduced tauopathy by promoting autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome system in a SON-dependent manner without causing cellular stress. Aberrant nuclear speckle morphology, reduced protein quality control and increased YAP1 activity were also observed in human tauopathies. Our study uncovers novel therapeutic targets for tackling protein misfolding disorders within an expanded proteostasis framework encompassing nuclear speckles and YAP1."
Cell Biology,Comparable anti-ageing efficacies of a multi-ingredient nutraceutical and a senolytic intervention in old mice,"Charlotte,Edward,Evon,Diogo,Thomas,Satomi,Charlotte,Edward,Evon,Diogo,Thomas,Satomi,Charlotte,Edward,Evon,Diogo,Thomas","Single-ingredient dietary supplements have demonstrated some potential to extend lifespan and improve healthspan; however, the efficacy of defined multi-ingredient nutraceuticals remains underexplored. Senolytic interventions have been successful in reducing multi-morbidity, frailty, and cognitive decline in animal models and are seen as promising anti-ageing interventions in mammals. We compared the effects of a 12-ingredient nutraceutical on mice lifespan and healthspan markers with that of a high efficacy senolytic intervention consisting of a low dose of Navitoclax combined with the specific mitochondrial uncoupler BAM15. Both interventions were started at old age (20 months). The supplement was given daily until the end of the experiment (30 months of age), but the senolytic intervention consisted of two short (5 days each) rounds of treatment at 20 and 23 months of age. Despite late onset, both interventions increased median lifespan similarly by around 20% over controls. The senolytic intervention significantly reduced frailty progression and improved cognitive function after the second round of treatment, but without subsequent treatment, these effects appeared to wane at later ages. The multi-ingredient supplement tended to reduce frailty progression steadily with time, albeit not significant, and maintained cognitive function. Mechanistically, in vitro, there was no evidence of senolytic activity of the multi-ingredient nutraceutical as a whole nor of its individual ingredients. Continuous multi-ingredient dietary supplementation shows promise in achieving comparable anti-ageing efficacy as a senolytic intervention."

However, these systems fail to capture the cellular diversity of the human airway epithelium. In this study, we developed an in vitro model where cryopreserved human nasal epithelial cells, collected by brushings, are differentiated under submerged conditions on standard plastic cultureware. By applying small-molecule inhibitors targeting Notch and BMP signaling, we achieved efficient differentiation of cultures containing basal, secretory, and ciliated cells. This approach supports scalable culturing of both 2D epithelial monolayers and 3D organoids, validated as (personalized) disease models for primary ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis, and respiratory syncytial virus infection. This model offers a cost-effective, scalable platform that combines the simplicity of traditional cultures with the cellular complexity of the human airway epithelium, providing a valuable tool for respiratory disease research."
Cell Biology,Physics-Informed Ellipsoidal Coordinate Encoding Implicit Neural Representation for high-resolution volumetric wide-field microscopy,"You,Chenyu,Zhouyu,Yanqin,Bei,Meiyue,Bo,Xun,Ning,You,Chenyu,Zhouyu,Yanqin,Bei,Meiyue,Bo,Xun,Ning,You,Chenyu,Zhouyu,Yanqin,Bei,Meiyue,Bo,Xun","Wide-field fluorescence microscopy through axial scanning provides a simple way for volumetric imaging of cellular and intracellular activities, but the optical transfer function (OTF) of wide-field microscopy suffers from axial frequency deficiencies, leading to strong interference from out-of-focus fluorescence signals and reduced imaging quality. Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution and its variants are commonly employed to reduce inter-plane signal interference of wide-field microscopy. However, these methods are still affected by the ""missing cone"" issue inherent in the OTF, compromising both the axial resolution and optical sectioning capability. Existing deep learning methods could realize high-fidelity 3D image stack restoration, but relying on high-quality paired datasets or specific assumptions about sample distributions. Here, we propose a novel method named physics-informed ellipsoidal coordinate encoding implicit neural representation (PIECE-INR), to tackle the challenges of background signal interference and resolution loss in axial scanning image stacks using the wide-field microscopy. In PIECE-INR, we integrate the wide-field fluorescence imaging model with the self-supervised INR network for high-fidelity reconstruction of 3D fluorescence data without the need of additional ground truth data for training. We further design a novel ellipsoidal coordinate encoding based on the system's OTF constraints and incorporate implicit priors derived from the physical model as the loss function into the reconstruction process. Our approach enables block-wise reconstruction of large-scale images by using localized physical information. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our PIECE-INR method in volumetric imaging of live HeLa cells, large-volume C. elegans whole-embryo, and mitochondrial dynamics."

Ribosomes have emerged as signaling hubs that sense metabolic perturbations and coordinate responses that either restore homeostasis or trigger cell death. As yet, the mechanisms governing these cell fate decisions are not well understood. Here, we report an unexpected role for the atypical E3 ligase HOIL-1 in safeguarding the ribosome. We find HOIL-1 mutations associated with cardiomyopathy broadly sensitize cells to nutrient and translational stress. These signals converge on the ribotoxic stress sentinel ZAKα. Mechanistically, mutant HOIL-1 excludes a ribosome quality control E3 ligase from its functional complex and remodels the ribosome ubiquitin landscape. This quality control failure renders glucose starvation ribotoxic, precipitating a ZAKα-ATF4-xCT-driven noncanonical cell death. We further show HOIL-1 loss exacerbates cardiac dysfunction under pressure overload. These data reveal an unrecognized ribosome signaling axis and a molecular circuit controlling cell fate during nutrient stress."
Physiology,Noninvasive Assessment of Temporal Dynamics in Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Baroreflex Responses,"Heberto,Negmeldeen Mamoun,Joseph P,Andrey,Heberto,Negmeldeen Mamoun,Joseph P,Andrey,Heberto,Negmeldeen Mamoun,Joseph P","Background: The baroreflex system is crucial for cardiovascular regulation and autonomic homeostasis. A comprehensive assessment requires understanding the simultaneous temporal dynamics of its multiple functional branches, which traditional methods often overlook. Objective: To develop and validate a noninvasive method for simultaneously assessing the temporal dynamics of sympathetic and parasympathetic baroreflexes using pulse contour analysis and the sequence method. Methods: Beat-to-beat blood pressure and ECG recordings were analyzed from 55 preoperative cardiothoracic surgery patients in the supine position and 21 subjects from the EUROBAVAR dataset in both supine and standing positions. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP), interbeat interval (IBI), cardiac output (CO), myocardial contraction (dP/dtmax), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were estimated using pulse contour analysis. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was calculated via the sequence method and correlated with hemodynamic and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters. Results: Parasympathetic BRS for IBI was correlated with the root mean square of successive differences of ECG RR intervals (RMSSD-HRV) at 0-beat delay. Sympathetic BRS for SVR strongly correlated with SVR, CO, and RMSSD-HRV, particularly at 3-beat delay, and was uniquely associated with SAP at 1-beat delay. Sympathetic BRS for dP/dtmax correlated with dP/dtmax at 1-beat delay. In contrast, BRS for CO correlated with CO and SVR at 0- and 3-beat delays. Postural changes mainly affected parasympathetically-mediated BRS for IBI and, to a lesser extent, the sympathetic vascular and myocardial branches. Conclusions: This method effectively captures multiple baroreflex responses and their temporal dynamics, revealing distinct autonomic mechanisms and the impact of postural changes. Further validation is warranted."
Biochemistry,Role of ribosomal protein bS1 in orthogonal mRNA start codon selection,"Kristina V.,Rebecca A.,Minji,Jamie H. D.,Kristina V.,Rebecca A.,Minji,Jamie H. D.,Kristina V.,Rebecca A.,Minji","In many bacteria, the location of the mRNA start codon is determined by a short ribosome binding site sequence that base pairs with the 3′-end of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the 30S subunit. Many groups have changed these short sequences, termed the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence in the mRNA and the anti-Shine-Dalgarno (ASD) sequence in 16S rRNA, to create “orthogonal” ribosomes to enable the synthesis of orthogonal polymers in the presence of the endogenous translation machinery. However, orthogonal ribosomes are prone to SD-independent translation. Ribosomal protein bS1, which binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, is thought to promote translation initiation by shuttling mRNA to the ribosome. Thus, a better understanding of how the SD and bS1 contribute to start codon selection could help efforts to improve the orthogonality of ribosomes. Here we engineered the , ribosome to prevent binding of bS1 to the 30S subunit, to separate the activity of bS1 binding to the ribosome from the role of the mRNA SD sequence in start codon selection. We find that ribosomes lacking bS1 are slightly less active than wild-type ribosomes ,. Furthermore, orthogonal 30S subunits lacking bS1 do not have improved orthogonality. Our findings suggest that mRNA features outside the SD sequence and independent of bS1 binding to the ribosome likely contribute to start codon selection and the lack of orthogonality of present orthogonal ribosomes."

This study investigated whether cone photoreceptors also influence melatonin suppression and subjective alertness using non-visual metameric light emitted from a display. Forty-eight participants with normal trichromatic vision were exposed to three lighting conditions: a baseline (9 lx,), constant background (149 lx,), and cone-modulated flickering light targeting different cone combinations and post-receptoral channels (149 lx,) for 2 hours after their habitual bedtime. Salivary melatonin levels and subjective alertness were measured throughout a 9-h protocol. Bayesian analysis showed that cone-modulated flickering light did not significantly affect melatonin suppression or alertness, providing evidence against the hypothesis that cone photoreceptors contribute to these non-visual effects of light. In conclusion, our results suggest cone photoreceptors do not play a measurable role in light’s effects on melatonin suppression and subjective alertness at night."
Biochemistry,Mechanochemical forces regulate the composition and fate of stalled nascent chains,"Danish,Ananya A,Cole S,Onn,Danish,Ananya A,Cole S,Onn,Danish,Ananya A,Cole S","The ribosome-associated ,uality ,ontrol (RQC) pathway resolves stalled ribosomes. As part of RQC, stalled nascent polypeptide chains (NCs) are appended with ,rboxy-,erminal amino acids (CAT tails) in an mRNA-free, non-canonical elongation process. CAT tail composition includes Ala, Thr, and potentially other residues. The relationship between CAT tail composition and function has remained unknown. Using biochemical approaches in yeast, we discovered that mechanochemical forces on the NC regulate CAT tailing. We propose CAT tailing initially operates in an “extrusion mode” that increases NC lysine accessibility for on-ribosome ubiquitination. Thr in CAT tails enhances NC extrusion by preventing formation of polyalanine, which can form α-helices that lower extrusion efficiency and disrupt termination of CAT tailing. After NC ubiquitylation, pulling forces on the NC switch CAT tailing to an Ala-only “release mode” which facilitates nascent chain release from large ribosomal subunits and NC degradation. Failure to switch from extrusion to release mode leads to accumulation of NCs on large ribosomal subunits and proteotoxic aggregation of Thr-rich CAT tails."

To further define the molecular pathways in synovial inflammation and a response of the intestinal tissues, we have now used a rat model of mono-joint inflammatory arthritis, induced by intra-articular injection (IAI) of Complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA). The predominant inflammatory response of a single injection of the adjuvant into the knee joint resulted in rapid and reproducible formation of a fibrotic myeloid-infiltrated synovial pannus. Our aim was to determine how intestinal tissues, including the proximal and distal ileum and distal colon, respond to inflammatory changes in the synovium in a temporally coordinated manner by comparing their transcriptomic landscapes using RNASeq analyses. We confirmed the timeline of joint inflammation by knee joint swelling measurement, synovial fluid levels of the acute phase protein Inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chains (ITIH) and demonstrated a self-correcting response of trabecular and cortical bone to the CFA challenge. Intestine-specific responses were monitored by 16S microbiome amplicon sequencing, histopathology for mucus layer integrity, and immune cell immunohistochemistry. We present data showing that the intestinal tissue response to the acute joint inflammation was region specific, with the ileum primarily responding with increased mucus secretion and silencing of T cell specific pathways, whereas the colon showed a transient upregulation of macrophages, with a broader suppression of immune related and metabolic pathway related transcripts. However, at no time after CFA-IAI were there significant changes in the fecal microbiome composition of the ileum or the colon. In summary, our data report for the first time a suppression of intestinal inflammatory and immune responses following the induction of joint inflammation and only minimal and transient changes in the microbiome."
Biochemistry,Assessing substrate scope of the cyclodehydratase LynD by mRNA display-enabled machine learning models,"Emma G.,Henry,Jarrett M.,Brian,Albert A.,Emma G.,Henry,Jarrett M.,Brian,Albert A.,Emma G.,Henry,Jarrett M.,Brian","Many of the biosynthetic pathways for ribosomal synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) natural products make use of multi-domain enzymes with separate recruitment and catalysis domains that separately bind and modify peptide substrates. This “division of labor” allows RiPP enzymes to use relatively open and promiscuous active sites to perform chemistry at multiple residues within a peptide substrate seemingly regardless of the surrounding context. Defining, measuring, and predicting the seemingly broad substrate promiscuity of RiPPs necessitates high throughput assays, capable of assessing activity against very large libraries of peptides. Using mRNA display, a high throughput peptide display technology, we examine the substrate promiscuity of the RiPP cyclodehydratase, LynD. The vast substrate profiling that can be done with mRNA display enables the construction of deep learning models for accurate prediction of substrate processing by LynD. These models further inform on epistatic interactions involved in enzymatic processing. This work will facilitate the further elucidation of other RiPP enzymes and enable their use in the modification of mRNA display libraries for selection of modified peptide-based inhibitors and therapeutics."

This study investigates the effects of increased warmer night temperatures (WNT), a consequence of global warming, on the quality of rice kernel, particularly grain chalkiness. By integrating computational and experimental approaches, we used a rice grain metabolic network to discover the metabolic factors of chalkiness. For this, we reconstructed the rice grain genome-scale metabolic model (GSM), iOSA3474-G and incorporated transcriptomics data from three different times of the day (dawn, dawn 7h, and dusk) for both control and WNT conditions with iOSA3474-G. Three distinct growth phases: anoxia, normoxia, and hyperoxia, were identified in rice kernels from the GSMs, highlighting the grain-filling pattern under varying oxygen levels. We predicted histidine as a marker of normoxia, during which kernel chalkiness occurs. Moreover, we proposed tyrosine as a marker for the hyperoxic growth phase. We also proposed a potential link between monodehydroascorbate reductase, an enzyme with evolutionary significance dating back to the carboniferous era, in regulating the hyperoxic growth phase. Metabolic bottleneck analysis identified nucleoside diphosphate kinase as a central regulator of metabolic flux under different conditions. These findings provide targeted insights into the complex metabolic network governing rice grain chalkiness under WNT conditions. Integration of GSM and transcriptomics data, enhanced our understanding of the intricate relationship between environmental factors, metabolic processes, and grain quality and also offer markers that can be useful to develop rice with improved resilience."

PM repair processes, including exocytosis and endocytosis, are not mutually exclusive; rather, they collaborate to repair the wound. However, the temporal coordination between the repair processes remains poorly understood. Here, by comprehensively identifying PM repair proteins, we resolved the temporal PM repair processes at the damage site in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Of the 80 repair proteins identified, 72 proteins were previously unreported repair protein candidates. We showed that polarity establishment, polarized exocytosis, and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) occur in a specific temporal order at the damage site. Furthermore, we showed that polarized exocytosis and CME are coupled at the damage site, delivering PM repair proteins with transmembrane domains between the growing bud site and the damage site. This study provides insights into the temporal dynamics of coordinated cellular response to PM damage."
Physiology,Oxygen chemoreceptor inhibition by dopamine D,"Maddison,Michael G.,Maddison,Michael G.,Maddison","Dopamine is an essential modulator of oxygen sensing and control of ventilation and was the first neurotransmitter described in the carotid body. Little is known of the evolutionary significance of dopamine in oxygen sensing, or whether it plays a similar role in anamniotes. In the model vertebrate, zebrafish (,), presynaptic dopamine D, receptor expression was demonstrated in gill neuroepithelial cells (NECs)—analogues of mammalian oxygen chemoreceptors; however, a mechanism for dopamine and D, in oxygen sensing in the gills had not been defined. The present study tested the hypothesis that presynaptic D, receptors provide a feedback mechanism that attenuates the chemoreceptor response to hypoxia. Using an isolated gill preparation from Tg(,:GCaMP6s) zebrafish, we measured hypoxia-induced changes in intracellular Ca, concentration ([Ca,],) in NECs and postsynaptic neurons. Activation of D, with dopamine or specific D, agonist, quinpirole, decreased hypoxic responses in NECs; whereas D, antagonist, domperidone, had the opposite effect. Addition of SQ22536, an adenylyl cyclase (AC) inhibitor, decreased the effect of hypoxia on [Ca,],, similar to dopamine. Activation of AC by forskolin partially recovered the suppressive effect of dopamine on the Ca, response to hypoxia. Further, we demonstrate that the response to hypoxia in postsynaptic sensory neurons was dependent upon innervation with NECs, and was subject to modulation by activation of presynaptic D,. Our results provide the first evidence of neurotransmission of the hypoxic signal at the NEC-nerve synapse in the gill and suggest that a presynaptic, modulatory role for dopamine in oxygen sensing arose early in vertebrate evolution."
Cell Biology,β-adrenergic blockers increase cAMP and stimulate insulin secretion through a PKA/RYR2/TRPM5 pathway in pancreatic β-cells in vitro,"Naoya,Risa,Yusuke,Kenju,Yuko,Yuichiro,Atsushi,Naoya,Risa,Yusuke,Kenju,Yuko,Yuichiro,Atsushi,Naoya,Risa,Yusuke,Kenju,Yuko,Yuichiro","β-adrenergic blockers (β-blockers) are extensively utilized in the treatment of various cardiovascular conditions. However, their direct effects on insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells remain largely unexplored. This study investigates the impact of β-blockers on insulin secretion utilizing MIN6-K8 clonal β-cells and mouse islets in vitro. Various non-selective and β1-selective β-blockers were found to amplify glucose- and glimepiride-induced insulin secretion 1.5-2 fold. Surprisingly, some of the β-blockers (propranolol and bisoprolol) were found to increase cAMP production 5-10 fold via adenylyl cyclase, the effects being dependent on α2-adrenoceptors, which suggests cross-reactivity of these β-blockers and their receptors. Propranolol-stimulated insulin secretion involves a novel signaling pathway mediated by protein kinase A (PKA), ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 5 (TRPM5). Initially, cAMP activates PKA and triggers RYR2 phosphorylation and extracellular Ca, influx, leading to Ca,-induced Ca, release (CICR). Subsequently, CICR activates TRPM5, resulting in augmented extracellular Ca, influx through the L-type voltage-dependent Ca, channel (VDCC). Remarkably, propranolol-stimulated insulin secretion exhibited greater efficacy in diabetic mouse islets than in lean mouse islets, suggesting a potential strategy for the restoration of cAMP-stimulated insulin secretion in diabetic β-cells. Our findings provide insights into the fundamental pharmacology of adrenoceptors and the regulatory mechanisms of insulin secretion."

Beyond cost and delayed graft availability, the patient-specific performance of engineered tissues poses serious concerns on their clinical translation ability. A more exciting paradigm consists in exploiting cell-laid, engineered extracellular matrices (eECM), which can be used as off-the-shelf materials. Here, the regenerative capacity solely relies on the preservation of the eECM structure and embedded signals to instruct an endogenous repair. We recently described the possibility to exploit custom human stem cell lines for eECM manufacturing. In addition to the conferred standardization, the availability of such cell lines opened avenues for the design of tailored eECMs by applying dedicated genetic tools. In this study, we demonstrated the exploitation of CRISPR/Cas9 as a high precision system for editing the composition and function of eECMs. Human mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (hMSC) lines were modified to knockout VEGF and RUNX2 and assessed for their capacity to generate osteoinductive cartilage matrices. We report the successful editing of hMSCs, subsequently leading to targeted VEGF and RUNX2-knockout cartilage eECMs. Despite the absence of VEGF, eECMs retained full capacity to instruct ectopic endochondral ossification. Conversely, RUNX2-edited eECMs exhibited impaired hypertrophy, reduced ectopic ossification and superior cartilage repair in a rat osteochondral defect. In summary, our approach can be harnessed to identify the necessary eECM factors driving endogenous repair. Our work paves the road towards the compositional eECMs editing and their exploitation in broad regenerative contexts."

LGR4/5/6 (leucine-rich repeat containing, G protein-coupled receptor 4, 5, 6) are three related receptors that are expressed at high levels together or alternately in nearly all cases of CRC. ADCs targeting LGR5 have been shown to have robust anti-tumor potency, but not all CRC cells express LGR5 and LGR5-positive tumor cells may lose LGR5 expression due to cancer cell plasticity. R-spondin 4 (RSPO4) is a natural protein ligand of LGR4/5/6 with high affinity for all three receptors. We fused a mutant form of RSPO4 that retains high affinity binding to LGR4/5/6 to IgG1 Fc to create a peptibody designated R462. Conjugation of R462 with a camptothecin analog (CPT2) at eight drugs per peptibody led to the synthesis of R462-CPT2 that showed highly potent cytotoxic activity in vitro in CRC cell lines expressing any of LG4/5/6. In cell line xenograft and PDX models of CRC, R462-CPT2 demonstrated robust anti-tumor effect. Importantly, R462-CPT2 showed no major adverse effect at therapeutically effective dose levels. These results strongly support the use of RSPO ligand drug-conjugates that target LGR4/5/6 simultaneously for the treatment of CRC."

When grown in a 3D matrix of sustainably produced silk protein functionalized with a fibronectin-derived cell adhesion motif (FN-silk), endometrial stromal and epithelial cells respond to transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) in a physiological manner as probed at the mRNA level. For stromal cells, this response to TGF-β1 is not observed in spheroids, while epithelial cell spheroids behave similarly to epithelial cell FN-silk networks. Pirfenidone, an antifibrotic drug approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, reverses TGF-β1-induced upregulation of mRNA transcripts involved in fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation of endometrial stromal cells in FN-silk networks, supporting the drug’s potential as a repurposed non-hormonal therapy for endometriosis. This study demonstrates how a sustainable approach – from project conceptualization to material selection – can be integrated into pharmaceutical research for women’s health."
Pharmacology and Toxicology,Potent and durable gene modulation in heart and muscle with chemically defined siRNAs,"Hassan H.,Clemens,Rosemary,Ashley,Jillian,Julianna E.,Qi,Bruktawit,Samuel R.,Mohammad Zain,Raymond C.,Katherine Y.,Yen,David,Kathryn R.,Dimas,JaeHyuck,Ken,Julia F.,Anastasia,Hassan H.,Clemens,Rosemary,Ashley,Jillian,Julianna E.,Qi,Bruktawit,Samuel R.,Mohammad Zain,Raymond C.,Katherine Y.,Yen,David,Kathryn R.,Dimas,JaeHyuck,Ken,Julia F.,Anastasia,Hassan H.,Clemens,Rosemary,Ashley,Jillian,Julianna E.,Qi,Bruktawit,Samuel R.,Mohammad Zain,Raymond C.,Katherine Y.,Yen,David,Kathryn R.,Dimas,JaeHyuck,Ken,Julia F.","Small interfering RNA (siRNAs) hold immense promise for treating cardiac and muscular diseases, but robust and scalable delivery to these tissues remains a challenge. Recent advances in delivery strategies to muscle include conjugation of biologics (antibody/antibody fragments, peptides), which are currently in clinical development. However, the manufacturing of biologic-siRNA conjugates is a challenging and complex process. By contrast, lipophilic siRNAs are readily chemically synthesized at scale and support sufficient cardiac and skeletal muscle delivery. In this work, we refine siRNA design elements to enhance potency and durability and support clinically relevant silencing in muscle. Applying this strategy for siRNAs targeting myostatin (,), a key target in muscle-wasting conditions, we show that a single subcutaneous dose in mice achieved robust and durable silencing (∼80% inhibition up to 6 weeks, ∼30% at 14 weeks). Biweekly dosing resulted in >95% reduction of circulating , for half a year, with no observed systemic or target-related toxicity. , inhibition resulted in muscle growth and increased lean muscle mass, correlating with improved grip strength. Interestingly, the functional impact on muscle growth and strength significantly outlasts the target silencing, suggesting extended pharmacological effects. Systemic administration was equally efficacious in all muscle groups tested, including skeletal muscle, heart, tongue and diaphragm. The informational nature of the muscle-active chemically defined siRNA scaffold was confirmed by demonstrating muscle and heart efficacy with three additional targets. Our findings pave the way for potent and long-lasting gene modulation in muscle using chemically defined, lipophilic siRNAs, offering a new avenue for treating muscular diseases."

J.,Koenraad Van,Rachel S.,Rachel E.,Naveenchandra,James E.,Robert H.,Samuel K.","The sudden rise of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the delay in the development of effective therapeutics to mitigate it made evident a need for ways to screen for compounds that can block infection and prevent further pathogenesis and spread. Yet, identifying effective drugs efficacious against viral infection and replication with minimal toxicity for the patient can be difficult. Monoclonal antibodies were shown to be effective, yet as the SARS-CoV-2 mutated, these antibodies became ineffective. Small molecule antivirals were identified using pseudovirus constructs to recapitulate infection in non-human cells, such as Vero E6 cells. However, the impact was limited due to poor translation of these compounds in the clinical setting. This is partly due to the lack of similarity of screening platforms to the in vivo physiology of the patient and partly because drugs effective in vitro showed dose-limiting toxicities. In this study, we performed two high-throughput screens in human lung adenocarcinoma cells with authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus to identify both monoclonal antibodies that neutralize the virus and clinically useful kinase inhibitors to block the virus and prioritize minimal host toxicity. Using high-content imaging combined with single-cell and multidimensional analysis, we identified antibodies and kinase inhibitors that reduce virus infection without affecting the host. Our screening technique uncovered novel antibodies and overlooked kinase inhibitors (i.e. PIK3i, mTORi, multiple RTKi) that could be effective against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Further characterization of these molecules will streamline the repurposing of compounds for the treatment of future pandemics and uncover novel mechanisms viruses use to hijack and infect host cells."
Pharmacology and Toxicology,Opioid receptors reveal a discrete cellular mechanism of endosomal G protein activation,"Nicole M.,Mark,Nicole M.,Mark,Nicole M.","Many GPCRs initiate a second phase of G protein-mediated signaling from endosomes, which inherently requires an increase in G protein activity on the endosome surface. G,-coupled GPCRs are thought to achieve this by internalizing and allosterically activating cognate G proteins again on the endosome membrane. Here we demonstrate that the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), a G,-coupled GPCR, increases endosomal G protein activity in a different way. Leveraging conformational biosensors, we resolve the subcellular activation dynamics of endogenously expressed MOR and G,-subclass G proteins. We show that MOR activation triggers a transient increase of active-state G, on the plasma membrane that is followed by a prolonged increase on endosomes. Contrary to the G,-coupled GPCR paradigm, however, we show that the MOR-induced increase of active-state G, on endosomes requires neither internalization of MOR nor activation of MOR in the endosome membrane. We propose a distinct and additional cellular mechanism for GPCR-triggered elevation of G protein activity on endosomes that is mediated by regulated trafficking of the activated G protein rather than its activating GPCR."

Bioengineering,Heterologous expression and optimization of fermentation conditions for recombinant ikarugamycin production,"Julia K.,Anna,Monique,Sebastian,Manuel,Tobias A. M.,Julia K.,Anna,Monique,Sebastian,Manuel,Tobias A. M.,Julia K.,Anna,Monique,Sebastian,Manuel","Ikarugamycin is a member of the natural product family of the polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PoTeMs). The compound exhibits a diverse range of biological activities, including antimicrobial, antiprotozoal, anti-leukemic, and anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, it interferes with several crucial cellular functions, such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein uptake in macrophages, Nef-induced CD4 cell surface downregulation, and mechanisms of endocytosis. It is therefore used as a tool compound to study diverse biological processes. However, ikarugamycin commercial prices are very high, with up to 1300 € per 1 mg, thus limiting its application. We therefore set out to develop a high-yielding recombinant production platform of ikarugamycin by screening different expression vectors, recombinant host strains, and cultivation conditions. Overall, this has led to overproduction levels of more than 100 mg/L, which, together with a straightforward purification protocol, establishes biotechnological access to affordable ikarugamycin enabling its increased use in biomedical research in the future."
Bioengineering,Humans Exploit the Trade-Off Between Lateral Stability and Manoeuvrability During Walking,"Rucha,Francis M.,Anna,Xenia,Keith E.,Rucha,Francis M.,Anna,Xenia,Keith E.,Rucha,Francis M.,Anna,Xenia","People use the mechanical interplay between stability and manoeuvrability to successfully walk. During single limb support, body states (position and velocity) that increase lateral stability will inherently resist lateral manoeuvres, decrease medial stability, and facilitate medial manoeuvres. Although not well understood, people can make behavioural decisions exploiting this relationship in anticipation of perturbations or direction changes. To characterize the behavioural component of the stability-manoeuvrability relationship, twenty-four participants performed many repetitions of a discrete stepping task involving mid-trial reactive manoeuvres (medial or lateral direction) in a Baseline (no external perturbations) and Perturbed (random mediolateral perturbations applied to their pelvis) environment. We hypothesized people would make systematic changes in lateral stability dependent on both environment (increasing lateral stability in the Perturbed environment) and anticipated manoeuvre direction (reducing lateral stability to facilitate lateral manoeuvres). Participants increased lateral stability in the Perturbed environment, coinciding with an increase in manoeuvre reaction time for laterally but not medially directed manoeuvres. Moreover, we observed lower lateral stability in both environments when people anticipated making a lateral manoeuvre when compared to medial manoeuvres. These results support the hypothesis that people behaviourally exploit the mechanical relationship between lateral stability and manoeuvrability depending on walk task goals and external environment."

With cargos containing nucleic acids and other proteins, EVs play key roles in intercellular communication and other biological processes and are widely regarded as promising biomarkers for disease detection. EVs are abundantly found in virtually every biofluid, including blood, urine, and saliva. While there are numerous technologies to isolate EVs in blood and urine, isolating EVs from saliva remains a challenge, as it is highly complex and heterogeneous—cells, debris, and other proteins can all inhibit the isolation of EVs by traditional platforms. Here, we employ the CandyCollect, a lollipop-inspired sampling device with open microfluidic channels, as a non-invasive and patient-friendly alternative for the capture of salivary EVs. The CandyCollect simplifies sample preparation by effectively pre-concentrating EVs on the device surface before EVs are eluted off of the CandyCollect, labeled with cholesterol-tagged oligonucleotides, and subsequently detected by qPCR with primers specific for the tagged oligos to enumerate the relative number of EVs. We demonstrate that downstream EV cargo analysis can be performed using Simoa. Overall, the CandyCollect ushers a new method to capture, enumerate, and analyze salivary EVs."

A facile fabrication process was developed to create the metasurface on silicon wafers with a unique resonance signature. The resulting metasurface consists of periodic nanopillars approximately 180 nm in diameter, 210 nm deep, and with a controlled edge-to-edge separation of 200 nm. These dimensions were chosen based on a finite element method simulation that was used to investigate the ideal parameters to produce the desired resonance effect in the metasurface reflection spectra. Optimization of the nanopillar surface properties and the sidewall angle allowed for replication of the simulations. This metasurface was coupled with BSA-coated gold nanospheres (BSANS) to mediate the redshift of peak resonance wavelength values, occurring only in the presence of the antibiotic linker. The device fabricated herein exhibits a significant 22 nm wavelength shift resulting from changes to the local refractive index in the presence of the BSANS-antibiotic coupling. Further enhancement of the binding events is promoted by the LSPR hot spots formed between the nanoparticles and the metasurface allowing for sensitive and real-time detection."
Bioengineering,Odor sensory tests vs. In-silico prediction for the high-definition quantification of olfaction dynamics,"Islam  Mohamed Sayed,Kazuki,Kazuko,Megumi,Takahiro,Kazuhide,Islam  Mohamed Sayed,Kazuki,Kazuko,Megumi,Takahiro,Kazuhide,Islam  Mohamed Sayed,Kazuki,Kazuko,Megumi,Takahiro","The intricate dynamics of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the human respiratory system remain poorly understood. In the present study, we integrate odor sensory tests (OSTs) coupled with computational fluid dynamics and a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (CFD-PBPK) model to elucidate various aspects of the olfaction process. Safe yogurt-derived substances were incorporated in OSTs to prevent harmful exposure. Acetaldehyde was identified as a key active component in determining odor intensity, prompting further analysis of acetone and other four constituents of yogurt. Logarithmic correlations were established between the perceived odor intensity from the OSTs and both time-averaged absorption flux and equilibrium concentration within the olfactory mucus layer. These parameters were numerically captured, enabling the logarithmic approximation of odor intensity for different breathing profiles and the development of reliable prediction models for odor sensation based on quantifiable physiological parameters. The CFD-PBPK model captured detailed spatial and temporal variations of these parameters, which offers potential for future integrated/in-silico applications. Minor peaks of odor concentration were observed in the posterior olfactory regions during exhalation, revealing a retro-nasal phenomenon. Location-specific analysis revealed the nostrils and olfactory regions as the most accurate indicators of perceived odor intensity, proving the limitations of rough sensory assessments in the indoor/breathing zone scales. Acetone exhibited distinct absorption and desorption trends during the transitional phase between inhalation and exhalation, owing to the physical properties (diffusion and partition coefficients) that strongly characterize the olfaction dynamics."
Bioengineering,A Streamlined High-Throughput LC-MS Assay for Quantifying Peptide Degradation in Cell Culture,"Samuel J.,Abolfazl S.,E. Thomas,Samuel J.,Abolfazl S.,E. Thomas,Samuel J.,Abolfazl S.","Peptides are widely used in biomaterials due to their easy of synthesis, ability to signal cells, and modify the properties of biomaterials. A key benefit of using peptides is that they are natural substrates for cell-secreted enzymes, which creates the possibility of utilizing cell-secreted enzymes for tuning cell-material interactions. However, these enzymes can also induce unwanted degradation of bioactive peptides in biomaterials, or in peptide therapies. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a widely used, powerful methodology that can separate complex mixtures of molecules and quantify numerous analytes within a single run. There are several challenges in using LC-MS for the multiplexed quantification of cell-induced peptide degradation, including the need for non-degradable internal standards and the identification of optimal sample storage conditions. Another problem is that cell culture media and biological samples typically contain both proteins and lipids that can accumulate on chromatography columns and degrade their performance. However, removing these constituents can be expensive, time consuming, and increases sample variability. Here we show that directly injecting samples onto the LC-MS without any purification enables rapid and accurate quantification of peptide concentration, and that hundreds of LC-MS runs can be done on a single column without a significantly diminish the ability to quantify the degradation of peptide libraries. We also show that column failure is evident when hydrophilic peptides fail to be retained on the column, and this can be easily identified using standard peptide mixtures for column benchmarking. In total, this work introduces a simple and effective method for simultaneously quantifying the degradation of dozens of peptides in cell culture. By providing a streamlined and cost-effective method for the direct quantification of peptide degradation in complex biological samples, this work enables more efficient assessment of peptide stability and functionality, facilitating the development of advanced biomaterials and peptide-based therapies."
Physiology,FieldDino: High-throughput physio-morphological phenotyping of stomatal characteristics for plant breeding research,"Edward,Guy,Andrew,William,Edward,Guy,Andrew,William,Edward,Guy,Andrew","Stomatal anatomy and physiology define CO, availability for photosynthesis and regulate plant water use. Despite being key drivers of yield and dynamic responsiveness to abiotic stresses, conventional measurement techniques of stomatal traits are laborious and slow, limiting adoption in plant breeding. Advances in instrumentation and data analyses present an opportunity to screen stomatal traits at scales relevant to plant breeding. We present a high-throughput field-based phenotyping approach, FieldDino, for screening of stomatal physiology and anatomy. The method allows coupled measurements to be collected in <15 s and consists of: (1) stomatal conductance measurements using a handheld porometer; (2) , collection of epidermal images with a digital microscope, 3D-printed leaf clip and Python-based app; and (3) automated deep learning analysis of stomatal features. The YOLOv8-M model trained on images collected in the field achieved strong performance metrics with an mAP@0.5 of 97.1% for stomatal detection. Validation in large field trials of 200 wheat genotypes with two irrigation treatments captured wide diversity in stomatal traits. FieldDino enables stomatal data collection and analysis at unprecedented scales in the field. This will advance research on stomatal biology and accelerate the incorporation of stomatal traits into plant breeding programs for resilience to abiotic stress."

We tested the hypothesis that pathologic mechanical stress could alter transcription to induce smooth muscle phenotypic class switching. Methods: Primary human intestinal smooth muscle cells (HISMCs), seeded on electrospun aligned poly-ε-caprolactone nano-fibrous scaffolds, were subjected to pathologic, high frequency (1 Hz) uniaxial 3% cyclic stretch (loaded) or kept unloaded in culture for 6 hours. Total RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, and quantitative immunohistochemistry defined loading-induced changes in gene expression. NicheNet predicted how differentially expressed genes might impact HISMCs and other bowel cells. Results: Loading induced differential expression of 4537 genes in HISMCs. Loaded HISMCs had a less contractile phenotype, with increased expression of synthetic SMC genes, proinflammatory cytokines, and altered expression of axon guidance molecules, growth factors and morphogens. Many differentially expressed genes encode secreted ligands that could act cell-autonomously on smooth muscle and on other cells in the bowel wall. Discussion: HISMCs demonstrate remarkably rapid phenotypic plasticity in response to mechanical stress that may convert contractile HISMCs into proliferative, fibroblast-like cells or proinflammatory cells. These mechanical stress-induced changes in HISMC gene expression may be relevant for human bowel disease."
Physiology,Does PERM1 Regulate Systolic Cardiac Function? A Game of Numbers,"Alexey V.,Karthi,Brianna,Junco S.,Alexey V.,Karthi,Brianna,Junco S.,Alexey V.,Karthi,Brianna","We and others demonstrated that PERM1 is a positive regulator of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the heart. However, discrepant results have emerged with regard to whether PERM1 loss-of-function affect cardiac contractility. In order to exclude the possibility that the reported negative results can be due to insufficient power of statistical test, we conducted a more robust echocardiography (Echo) analysis by increasing the sample size. We used ,-KO and their respective wildtype (WT) littermates, which were destined to tissue harvest. This yielded 84 WT mice and 88 ,-KO mice. We analyzed Echo-derived parameters of left ventricular (LV) systolic function. At the end of the study, ejection fraction (EF) was 65.43 ± 7.13 in WT vs. 53.98 ± 8.80 in P,-KO yielding p < 0.00000000000000004. Other parameters which reached statistically significant difference between WT and ,-KO (at p < 0.05) included LV fractional shortening (FS), LV diastolic and systolic diameters, LV anterior and posterior systolic wall thickness, LV posterior wall systolic thickening, stroke volume, and cardiac output (CO). Retrospectively, a p value < 0.05 was consistently achieved in assessment of EF only after average N per group reached 13. Larger minimal N per group were required for other parameters. Of interest, in both groups there were no correlation between EF% and CO. At the same time, in both groups EF strongly inversely correlated with LV diastolic diameter. This led us to a speculation that low EF may be in part compensated by an increased LV circumference, for the purpose of maintaining invariant CO. Indeed, the intergroup difference in CO (6%) was much smaller than the intergroup difference in EF (18%). We conclude that PERM1 does regulate cardiac mechanics. Changes caused by constitutive ,-KO can be conceptualized as reduced contractility partially compensated by increased LV circumference. This study underscores the importance of sufficiently large sample size for detecting significant differences in Echo data."

There is growing evidence that, in addition to BAK and BAX, lipids play an important role in pore formation. Towards a better understanding of the lipidic drivers of  apoptotic pore formation in isolated mitochondria, two complementary approaches were taken. Firstly, the lipids released during BAK-mediated pore formation were measured with targeted lipidomics, revealing enrichment of long chain polyunsaturated lysophospholipids (LPLs) in the released fraction. In contrast, the BAK protein was not released suggesting that BAK and LPLs locate to distinct microdomains. Secondly, added cholesterol not only prevented pore formation but prevented the clustering of BAK homodimers. Our data lead us to a model in which BAK clustering triggers formation of a separate microdomain rich in LPLs that can progress to lipid shedding and the opening of a lipid-lined pore. Pore stabilisation and growth may be due to BAK dimers then moving to the pore edge. Our BAK-lipid microdomain model supports the heterogeneity of BAK assemblies, and the observed lipid-release signature gives new insight into the genesis of the apoptotic pore."
Physiology,Lead as a toxic environmental toxicant in models of synucleinopathies,"Liana,Ângela,Filipa,Isabel,Vera,Tiago F.,Liana,Ângela,Filipa,Isabel,Vera,Tiago F.,Liana,Ângela,Filipa,Isabel,Vera","Lead, a toxic heavy metal, is prevalent in various industrial applications, contributing to environmental contamination and significant health concerns. Lead affects various body systems, especially the brain, causing long-lasting cognitive and behavioral changes. While most studies have focused on continuous lead exposure, intermittent exposure, such as that caused by migration or relocations, has received less attention. Importantly, lead exposure intensifies the severity of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies, diseases involving the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) in the brain and in the gut. Although, the precise mechanisms underlying these observations remain unclear, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction likely play a role. Here, we investigated how two different profiles of lead exposure - continuous and intermittent - affect models of synucleinopathies. We found that lead exposure enhances the formation of aSyn inclusions, resulting in an increase in both their number and size in cell models. In addition, we found that animals injected with aSyn pre-formed fibrils display serine 129-phosphorylated aSyn inclusions and a reduction in astrocytes in the substantia nigra. These animals also display neuronal damage and alterations in locomotor activity, exploratory behavior, anxiety, memory impairments and hypertension. Our results suggest a mechanistic link between environmental lead exposure and the onset and progression of diseases associated with aSyn pathology. Understanding the molecular and cellular interactions between lead and aSyn is crucial for shaping public health policies and may provide novel insight into strategies for mitigating the impact of environmental toxins on neurodegenerative processes involved in Parkinson’s disease and related synucleinopathies."

High-altitude exposure is typically incorporated in elite sport training regimens, but little is known about how this network adapts to an environment characterised by tissue hypoxia. For this reason, we investigated how high-altitude exposure affects mitochondrial subcellular distribution, ultrastructure, respiratory control, and intrinsic mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Nine healthy and recreationally active sea-level residents (eight males and one female) resided at an altitude of 3454 m with biopsies collected from the vastus lateralis muscle before and after 7 and 28 days at high altitude. The muscular mitochondrial volume density (,) increased after high-altitude exposure, driven by an increase in the intermyofibrillar ,. This was however accompanied by a decreased cristae surface area per skeletal muscle fibre volume (,) because of a decline in the cristae surface area per mitochondrial volume (,). Despite a reduced ,, mass-specific maximal coupled respiration (,) increased slightly, and was considerably elevated when normalised to ,, suggesting intrinsic adaptations to high altitude. The difference between cristae-specific , and an associated cristae-specific leak respiration (,) indicated a markedly higher degree of coupling between the electron flow in the electron transport system and ATP production. As the effect size 95% confidence intervals includes trivial effects the results need to be substantiated. In conclusion, high-altitude exposure altered mitochondrial subcellular distribution, ultrastructure and induced intrinsic respiratory adaptations."

When the pterygium tissue reaches the pupillary region, the visual function of the patient is affected. Currently, surgical removal is the only effective treatment. However, the recurrence rate of pterygium after surgery can be high. Pterygium is also a health disparity issue since it is more prevalent in the Hispanic and Latino American population. In this study, we determined if the Rho kinase inhibitor can be used to prevent pterygium recurrence since its anti-fibrosis effects have been reported in other cell and tissue types. We cultured primary pterygium cells from pterygium tissues from Hispanic and Latino American, African American, Caucasian, and Asian donors, and used those cells for viability assays, scratch assays, migration assays, and immunostaining of F-actin, fibronectin, collagen I and α smooth muscle actin. We found that the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 decreased cell viability, wound healing, cell migration, as well as the expression of extracellular matrix and myofibroblast markers in cultured pterygium cells. We believe that Rho kinases inhibitors are a potential post-surgical treatment to prevent pterygium recurrence."

An example found in protists and plants is the modification of serine and threonine residues of dozens to hundreds of nucleocytoplasmic proteins with a single fucose (O-Fuc). A nucleocytoplasmic O-fucosyltransferase (OFT) occurs in the pathogen Toxoplasma gondii, the social amoeba Dictyostelium, and higher plants, where it is called Spy because mutants have a spindly appearance. O-fucosylation, which is required for optimal proliferation of Toxoplasma and Dictyostelium, is paralogous to the O-GlcNAcylation of nucleocytoplasmic proteins of plants and animals that is involved in stress and nutritional responses. O-Fuc was first discovered in Toxoplasma using Aleuria aurantia lectin, but its broad specificity for terminal fucose residues on N- and O-linked glycans in the secretory pathway limits its use. Here we present affinity purified rabbit antisera that are selective for the detection and enrichment of proteins bearing fucose-O-Ser or fucose-O-Thr. These antibodies detect numerous nucleocytoplasmic proteins in Toxoplasma, Dictyostelium, and Arabidopsis, as well as O-Fuc occurring on secretory proteins of mammalian and Dictyostelium cells, although the latter are sometimes capped by further glycosylation. The antibodies label Toxoplasma, Acanthamoeba, and Dictyostelium  in a pattern reminiscent of O-GlcNAc in animal cells including nuclear pores. The O-fucome of Dictyostelium is partially conserved with that of Toxoplasma and is highly induced during starvation-induced development. These antisera demonstrate the unique antigenicity of O-Fuc, document conservation of the O-fucome among unrelated protists, and will enable the study of the O-fucomes of other organisms possessing OFT-like genes."

Our findings show that the ISR suppresses mitophagy under non-depolarizing mitochondrial stress by positively regulating mitochondrial protein import, independent of ATF4 activation. Mitochondrial protein import is regulated by the rate of protein synthesis under both depolarizing and non-depolarizing stress. Without ISR, increased protein synthesis overwhelms the mitochondrial import machinery, reducing its efficiency. Under depolarizing stress, mitochondrial import is heavily impaired even with active ISR, leading to significant PINK1 accumulation. In contrast, non-depolarizing stress allows more efficient protein import in the presence of ISR, resulting in lower mitophagy. Without ISR, mitochondrial protein import becomes severely compromised, causing PINK1 accumulation to reach the threshold necessary to trigger mitophagy. These findings reveal a novel link between ISR-regulated protein synthesis, mitochondrial import, and mitophagy, offering potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction."
Cell Biology,Modeling Compound Lipid Homeostasis Using Stable Isotope Tracing,"Karl,Maureen L.,Ethan L.,Hector M.,Christopher W,Grace,Shrikaar,Reuben J,Christian M,Karl,Maureen L.,Ethan L.,Hector M.,Christopher W,Grace,Shrikaar,Reuben J,Christian M,Karl,Maureen L.,Ethan L.,Hector M.,Christopher W,Grace,Shrikaar,Reuben J","Lipids represent the most diverse pool of metabolites found in cells, facilitating compartmentation, signaling, and other functions. Dysregulation of lipid metabolism is linked to disease states such as cancer and neurodegeneration. However, limited tools are available for quantifying metabolic fluxes across the lipidome. To directly measure reaction fluxes encompassing compound lipid homeostasis, we applied stable isotope tracing, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and network-based isotopologue modeling to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) models. Compound lipid metabolic flux analysis (CL-MFA) enables the concurrent quantitation of fatty acid synthesis, elongation, headgroup assembly, and salvage reactions within virtually any biological system. Here, we resolve liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-mediated regulation of sphingolipid recycling in NSCLC cells and precision-cut lung slice cultures. We also demonstrate that widely used tissue culture conditions drive cells to upregulate fatty acid synthase flux to supraphysiological levels. Finally, we identify previously uncharacterized isozyme specificity of ceramide synthase inhibitors, highlighting the molecular detail revealed by CL-MFA."
Bioengineering,Texture profile analysis and rheology of plant-based and animal meat,"Reese A.,Ethan C.,Valerie A.,Marc E.,Skyler R.,Ellen,Reese A.,Ethan C.,Valerie A.,Marc E.,Skyler R.,Ellen,Reese A.,Ethan C.,Valerie A.,Marc E.,Skyler R.","Plant-based meat can help combat climate change and health risks associated with high meat consumption. To create adequate mimics of animal meats, plant-based meats must match in mouthfeel, taste, and texture. The gold standard to characterize the texture of meat is the double compression test, but this test suffers from a lack of standardization and reporting inconsistencies. Here we characterize the texture of five plant-based and three animal meats using texture profile analysis and rheology, and report ten mechanical features associated with each product’s elasticity, viscosity, and loss of integrity. Our findings suggest that, of all ten features, the stiffness, storage, and loss moduli are the most meaningful and consistent parameter to report, while other parameters suffer from a lack of interpretability and inconsistent definitions. We find that the sample stiffness varies by an order of magnitude, from 418.9±41.7kPa for plant-based turkey to 56.7±14.1kPa for tofu. Similarly, the storage and loss moduli vary from 50.4± 4.1kPa and 25.3±3.0kPa for plant-based turkey to 5.7±0.5kPa and 1.3±0.1kPa for tofu. All three animal products, animal turkey, sausage, and hotdog, consistently rank in between these two extremes. Our results suggest that–with the right ingredients, additives, and formulae–modern food fabrication techniques can create plant-based meats that successfully replicate the full viscoelastic texture spectrum of processed animal meat."

However, information in more complex samples, such as tissues, is lacking. Importantly, these observations need to be set in context of populations; imaging on the molecular scale to-date is limited to few observations in-situ that struggle to be generalised. This is due to limitations in throughput and versatility employed by current instrumentation. Here, we utilise plasma focused ion beam milling to examine the molecular landscape of mouse hippocampus by cryoET in targeted regions across multiple individuals revealing the complex organisation of macromolecules from the CA1 strata pyramidale (sp) to radiatum (sr). Our data represent a molecular atlas, producing snapshots of hippocampal architecture in adult mouse. The combination of instrumentation and application of technical advancements provides a framework to explore specific structural questions within native tissues in a targeted manner."
Biochemistry,"Calcium-modulated cis and trans E-cadherin EC1-2 interactions play a key role in formation, dynamics and plasticity of cadherin junctions","Patrick,Patrick","Classical cadherins are ubiquitous calcium-dependent adhesive glycoproteins required in junction formation in metazoans. Calcium ions are essential for cadherin biological activity, but how they act in synergy is still a matter of controversy. We investigated by cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, a biomimetic system consisting of liposomes decorated with the two first E-cadherin extracellular modules, previously reported as functionally essential in junction formation. We showed that E-cadherin extracellular modules 1 and 2 are sufficient to form junctions in presence of calcium. Together with the first adhesive contacts, we observed the formation of cadherin patches and quasi-crystalline structures on the free surface of proteoliposomes suggesting that calcium complexation induces the self-interaction of the E-cadherin extracellular modules 1 and 2 through cis interactions. We propose that these calcium-dependent cadherin nanoplatforms, by facilitating the formation frequency of trans interactions, most probably favor the formation of junctions. We also observed a cooperative effect between trans and cis interactions leading to the protein depletion of liposome surfaces. Additionally, Cryo-electron tomography experiments performed on extracellular E-cadherin modules 1 and 2-mediated junctions revealed the coexistence of different molecular arrangements previously described from crystallography studies. Thus, this study provides a new insight into biophysical mechanisms underlying how calcium binding modulates cadherin adhesive function, in showing that E-cadherin 1 and 2 modules play a key role through their intrinsic ability to form multiple calcium-dependent cis and trans interactions, in the formation of cadherin junctions contributing to the dynamics and plasticity of cadherin-mediated cell junctions."
Biochemistry,Mechanistic Insights into Alcohol-Induced DNA Crosslink Repair by the Fanconi Anemia Nuclease Slx4-Xpf-Ercc1,"Jana,Milan,Andrea,Anthony,Evzen,Radim,Jan,Jana,Milan,Andrea,Anthony,Evzen,Radim,Jan,Jana,Milan,Andrea,Anthony,Evzen,Radim","During cell division, DNA replication stalls upon alcohol-derived interstrand crosslink, employing DNA repair pathways. Acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of alcohol, can induce DNA crosslinks between complementary DNA strands, causing significant genomic instability. The repair of acetaldehyde DNA crosslinks (AA-ICLs) is vital for maintaining genome integrity and preventing mutagenic events. The Fanconi anemia (FA) repair pathway's involvement in fixing the AA-ICLs is crucial, ensuring cellular homeostasis and safeguarding genomic stability. Dysregulation of the FA pathway has been linked to Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, including acetaldehyde. However, the precise mechanism of the repair and incision of AA-ICLs is unknown. Here, we demonstrate the role of the FA pathway nuclease SLX4-XPF-ERCC1 (SXE) in the repair of AA-ICL. We have generated site-specific AA-ICL within the replication fork, and we found SXE to excise the crosslink from the replication fork, bringing evidence of its role in the repair of alcohol-induced DNA lesions. This nuclease complex performs two precise incisions around the lesion. We also demonstrate that the SXE nuclease excises an abasic site interstrand crosslink in a similar manner. Given the evidence in conjunction with previous repair studies that have been conducted, our work suggests that SXE is a versatile nuclease complex."
Cell Biology,A role for class I PAKs in the regulation of the excitability of the actin cytoskeleton.,"Joe J,Anthony,Megan E,Montserrat Llanses,Pete J,Jason S.,Vassilis,Joe J,Anthony,Megan E,Montserrat Llanses,Pete J,Jason S.,Vassilis,Joe J,Anthony,Megan E,Montserrat Llanses,Pete J,Jason S.","P21 activated kinases (PAKs) are involved in a wide range of functions from the regulation of the cytoskeleton to the control of apoptosis and proliferation. Although many PAK substrates identified are implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a coherent picture of the total effect of PAK activation on the state of the actin cytoskeleton is unclear. We therefore set out to observe and quantify the effect of PAK inhibition on the actin cytoskeleton in greater detail. In Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts, inhibition of PAK kinase activity, either by treatment with small molecule inhibitors or overexpression of mutant PAK constructs leads to the constitutive production of patches of the phosphoinositide PIP3 on the ventral surface of the cell. The formation of these patches remodels the actin cytoskeleton and polarises the cell. From the overexpression of truncated and mutant PAK constructs as well as an in vitro model of PAK recruitment to small GTPases we propose that this is due to a hyper recruitment of PAK and PAK binding partners in the absence of PAK kinase activity. This aberrant production of PIP3 suggests that the kinase activity of class I PAKs acts to downregulate PI3K activity further highlighting class I PAKs as regulators of PI3K activity and therefore the excitability of the actin cytoskeleton."
Cell Biology,Intra-manchette transport employs both microtubule and actin tracks,"Jo,Laura,Tereza,Albert J.R.,Tzviya,Jo,Laura,Tereza,Albert J.R.,Tzviya,Jo,Laura,Tereza,Albert J.R.","The manchette is a transient microtubule based structure that plays a vital role in nuclear shaping during spermiogenesis. It comprises thousands of microtubules (MTs) that build a scaffold around the distal half of the nucleus. The manchette distributes proteins and vesicles during spermiogenesis in a process called intra-manchette transport (IMT). The current hypothesis is that IMT shares many similarities with intra-flagellar transport (IFT) and utilizes both MTs and filamentous actin (F-actin). However, IMT is still poorly understood as direct visualization of IMT complexes is missing, and the presence of F-actin has not been experimentally shown. Here, we use proteomics and cryogenic-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to identify and visualize IMT components. We find that F-actin is an integral part of the manchette with two different spatial organizations, namely bundles and single filaments, providing tracks for transport as well as having structural and mechanical roles. We further uncover that IMT on MTs is mediated by two distinct transport machineries: dynein mediated transport of soluble cargo and dynein independent transport for vesicles. Our results provide new insights into the manchette's function as a transport scaffold, highlighting its significance for the polarization of spermatids during spermiogenesis."
Biochemistry,Recognition and Cleavage of Human tRNA Methyltransferase TRMT1 by the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease,"Angel,Xuhang,Saba,Sophie,Evan P,Lucie,Yingkai,Jeffrey S,Angel,Xuhang,Saba,Sophie,Evan P,Lucie,Yingkai,Jeffrey S,Angel,Xuhang,Saba,Sophie,Evan P,Lucie,Yingkai","The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro, or Nsp5) is critical for the production of functional viral proteins during infection and, like many viral proteases, can also target host proteins to subvert their cellular functions. Here, we show that the human tRNA methyltransferase TRMT1 can be recognized and cleaved by SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. TRMT1 installs the N2,N2-dimethylguanosine (m2,2G) modification on mammalian tRNAs, which promotes global protein synthesis and cellular redox homeostasis. We find that Mpro can cleave endogenous TRMT1 in human cell lysate, resulting in removal of the TRMT1 zinc finger domain. TRMT1 proteolysis results in elimination of TRMT1 tRNA methyltransferase activity and reduced tRNA binding affinity. Evolutionary analysis shows that the TRMT1 cleavage site is highly conserved in mammals, except in Muroidea, where TRMT1 is likely resistant to cleavage. In primates, regions outside the cleavage site with rapid evolution could indicate adaptation to ancient viral pathogens.  Furthermore, we determined the structure of a TRMT1 peptide in complex with Mpro, revealing a substrate binding conformation distinct from the majority of available Mpro-peptide complexes. Kinetic parameters for peptide cleavage show that the TRMT1(526-536) sequence is cleaved with comparable efficiency to the Mpro-targeted nsp8/9 viral cleavage site. Mutagenesis studies and molecular dynamics simulations together indicate that kinetic discrimination occurs during a later step of Mpro-mediated proteolysis that follows substrate binding. Our results provide new information about the structural basis for Mpro substrate recognition and cleavage, the functional roles of the TRMT1 zinc finger domain in tRNA binding and modification, and the regulation of TRMT1 activity by SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. These studies could inform future therapeutic design targeting Mpro and raise the possibility that proteolysis of human TRMT1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection suppresses protein translation and oxidative stress response to impact viral pathogenesis."

Golgi Reassembly Stacking Proteins, GRASP55 and GRASP65, are vital for maintaining Golgi structure and function. GRASP55 depletion results in the missorting and secretion of the lysosomal enzyme Cathepsin D (Xiang et al., 2013), though the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we conducted secretomic analyses of GRASP55 knockout (KO) cells and found a significant increase in lysosome-associated proteins in the extracellular medium. Using the lysosomal beta-hexosaminidase subunit alpha (HEXA) as a model, we found that GRASP55 depletion disrupted normal trafficking and processing of HEXA, resulting in increased secretion of the immature (pro-form) HEXA into the extracellular milieu, along with decreased levels of the mature form and enzymatic activity within the cell. GRASP55 depletion significantly reduced the complex formation between HEXA and mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptors (MPR), despite no overall change in MPR expression. And finally, we found there was a notable reduction in the expression of GNPTAB, leading to a reduction in M6P modification of HEXA, hindering its efficient targeting to lysosomes. These findings reveal the role of GRASP55 in regulating lysosomal enzyme dynamics, emphasizing its role in the sorting and trafficking of lysosomal proteins."

Sakil,Md. Sohel","Background: The metabolic syndrome (Met-S) is a cluster of some interrelated common clinical disorders, including central obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and glucose intolerance. Central obesity, accompanied by insulin resistance, is a key factor for the development of metabolic syndrome. Adiponectin is an adipose-specific plasma protein, secreted from adipocyte with anti-atherogenic and insulin-sensitizing activities.
Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the relationship of plasma adiponectin levels with metabolic syndrome, related disorders and it's drug repurposing through in silico approach.
Materials and Methods: For this study, 269 individuals were recruited with written consent. The participants were selected based on their full medical history, clinical examination, and laboratory reports. Anthropometric measurements as well as blood pressure was measured before sample collection. Fasting blood samples were collected for the estimation of lipid profile, blood glucose, and serum adiponectin levels.
Results: Our results show that the adiponectin levels in the subjects with Met-S were significantly lower than those of without Met-S (p <0.0001). Among the metabolic syndrome risk factors, adiponectin levels were associated with hypertriglyceridemia and reduced HDL-cholesterol (p<0.0001). Three drugs (Saquinavir, Candesartan and Glimepiride) were suggested to control the plasma adiponectin level in the subjects with Met-S.
Conclusions: Since the plasma adiponectin levels are significantly lower in patients with Met-S, it might be used as diagnostic & prognostic marker for Met-S disorder and adiponectin targeted drugs might be minimize the Met-S of the subjects."

Despite low sequence identity, their classification into families is feasible using structural homology. In this study, we have elucidated the structures of the two effectors Mycgr3-91409 and Zt-NIP1 from the wheat fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici using X-ray crystallography and NMR. These proteins shared structural homology with, respectively, KP6alpha and KP4 killer toxins, encoded by UmV dsRNA viruses infecting the corn fungal pathogen Ustilago maydis. Consequently, Zt-Mycgr3-91409 and Zt-NIP1 were renamed Zt-KP6-1 and Zt-KP4-1. Orthologs and paralogs of Zt-KP6-1 and Zt-KP4-1 were identified in Zymoseptoria species, but not in other fungi, with the exception of ECP2 effectors related to Zt-KP4-1. A novel pipeline relying on Foldseek and cysteine-pattern constrained HMM searches identified a large number of proteins structurally related to Zt-KP6-1 and Zt-KP4-1 in fungi, and to Zt-KP4-1 in plants. These proteins were classified into distinct structural super families (4 KP4 and 3 KP6) including effectors not known as structurally related to KP4 (ECP2) or KP6 (BAS4). The biological activities of Zt-KP6-1 and Zt-KP4-1 were assessed on plants and fungi. They did not induce symptoms on wheat leaves. However, they inhibited the growth of Botrytis cinerea and Z. tritici, demonstrating their toxicity to fungi. These results highlight the importance of structure determination of effectors for their classification and the prediction of their function."
Systems Biology,Biotic resistance predictably shifts microbial invasion regimes,"Xiaozhou,Or,Christoph,Xiaozhou,Or,Christoph,Xiaozhou,Or","Invading new territory is a central aspect of the microbial lifestyle, allowing microbes to expand to remote locations and pathogens to spread and infect their hosts. However, invading microbes rarely find novel territories uninhabited. In such a scenario, resident microbes can interact with the newcomers and, in many cases, impede their invasion, an effect known as biotic resistance. Accordingly, invasions are shaped by the interplay between dispersal and resistance. However, these two factors are difficult to disentangle or manipulate in natural systems, making their interplay difficult to understand. To address this challenge, we tracked microbial invasions in the lab over space and time, first in a model system of two interacting microbes, then in a multi-strain system involving a pathogen invading resident communities. In the presence of biotic resistance, we observed three qualitatively different invasion regimes: consistent, pulsed, and pinned, where, in the third regime, strong biotic resistance stalled the invasion entirely despite ongoing invader dispersal. Surprisingly, these rich invasion dynamics could be qualitatively predicted with a simple, parameter-free framework that ignores individual species interactions, even for rather complex communities. Moreover, we showed that this simple framework could accurately predict simulated invasions from different mechanistic models, indicating its broad applicability. Our work offers a thorough understanding of how biotic resistance impacts invasions and introduces a predictive tool to identify invasion-resistant communities."

Yet, there remains a need to develop methods to understand the interaction of microbiome factors with host cells and to characterize their potential therapeutic functions. To address this challenge, we developed a systems biology framework we term the Pharmacobiome for microbiome pharmacology analysis. The Pharmacobiome framework evaluates similarities between microbes and microbial byproducts and known drugs based on their impact on host transcriptomic cellular signatures. Here, we apply our framework to characterization of the Anti-Gynecologic Cancer Vaginal Pharmacobiome. Using published vaginal microbiome multi-omics data from the Partners PrEP clinical trial, we constructed vaginal epithelial gene signatures associated with each profiled vaginal microbe and metabolite. We compared these microbiome-associated host gene signatures to post-drug perturbation host gene signatures associated with 35 FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures database to identify vaginal microbes and metabolites with high statistical and functional similarity to these drugs. We found that Lactobacilli and their metabolites can regulate host gene expression in ways similar to many anti-cancer drugs. Additionally, we experimentally tested our model prediction that taurine, a metabolite produced by L. crispatus, kills cancerous breast and endometrial cancer cells. Our study shows that the Pharmacobiome is a powerful framework for characterizing the anti-cancer therapeutic potential of vaginal microbiome factors with generalizability to other cancers, microbiomes, and diseases."

This SLC-centric knowledge is made accessible to the scientific community via a web portal, featuring interactive dashboards and a tool for family-wide, tree-based visualization of SLC properties. Making use of the systematically collected and curated data sets, we selected eight feature-dimensions to compute an integrated functional landscape of human SLCs. This landscape represents various functional aspects, harmonizing local and global features of the underlying data sets, as demonstrated by inspecting structural folds and subcellular locations of selected transporters. Based on all available data sets and their integration, we assigned a biochemical/biological function to each SLC, making it one of the largest systematic annotations of human gene function and likely acting as a blueprint for future endeavours."
Systems Biology,Energy-based Modelling of Single Actin Filament Polymerisation Using Bond Graphs,"Peter,Michael,Vijay,Peter,Michael,Vijay,Peter,Michael","Bond graphs provide an energy-based methodology for modelling complex systems in a hierarchical fashion; at the moment, the method allows biological system with both chemical and electrical subsystems to be modelled. Herein, the bond graph approach is extended to include chemomechanical transduction thus extending the range of biological systems to be modelled.
Actin filament polymerisation and force generation is used as an example of chemomechanical transduction and it is shown that the TF (transformer) bond graph component provides a practical, and conceptually simple, alternative to the Brownian ratchet approach of Peskin, Odell, Oster & Mogilner. Furthermore it is shown that the bond graph approach leads to the same equation as the Brownian ratchet approach in the simplest case.
The approach is illustrated by showing that flexibility and non-normal incidence can be modelled by simply adding additional bond graph components and that compliance leads to non-convexity of the force-velocity curve.
Energy flows are fundamental to life; for this reason, the energy based approach is utilised to investigate the power transmission by the actin filament and its corresponding efficiency.
The bond graph model is fitted to experimental data by adjusting model physical parameters."

Here, we report the discovery of frequent genetic alterations in the desmosome in human cancers, with the strongest signal seen in cutaneous melanoma where desmosomes are mutated in >70% of cases. In primary but not metastatic melanoma biopsies, the burden of coding mutations in desmosome genes associates with a strong reduction in desmosome gene expression. Analysis by spatial transcriptomics and protein immunofluorescence suggests that these expression decreases occur in keratinocytes in the microenvironment rather than in primary melanoma cells. In further support of a microenvironmental origin, we find that desmosome gene knockdown in keratinocytes yields markedly increased proliferation of adjacent melanoma cells in keratinocyte/melanoma co-cultures. Similar increases in melanoma proliferation are observed in media preconditioned by desmosome-deficient keratinocytes. Thus, gradual accumulation of desmosome mutations in neighboring cells may prime melanoma cells for neoplastic transformation."

Bacillus methanolicus is the next workhorse in biotechnology using methanol, an alternative and economical one-carbon feedstock that can be obtained directly from carbon dioxide, as both carbon and energy source for the production of various value-added chemicals. The wild-type strain B. methanolicus MGA3 naturally overproduces L-glutamate in methanol-based fed-batch fermentations.
Results
Here we generated, by induced mutagenesis, an evolved B. methanolicus strain exhibiting enhanced L-glutamate production capability (>150%). To showcase the potential of this evolved strain, further metabolic engineering enabled the production of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) directly from L-glutamate, with a yield of 13.2 g/L from methanol during fed-batch fermentations. By using a systems-level analysis, encompassing whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, fluxome analysis and genome-scale metabolic modelling, we were able to elucidate the metabolic and regulatory adaptations that sustain the biosynthesis of these products. The metabolism of the mutant strain evolved to prioritize energy conservation and efficient carbon utilization. Key metabolic shifts include the downregulation of energy-intensive processes such as flagellation and motility and the rerouting of carbon fluxes towards α-ketoglutarate and its derivative, L-glutamate. Moreover, we observed that transformation of the evolved strain with a GABA biosynthesis plasmid had a positive effect on L-glutamate production, likely due to an upregulation of various transaminases involved in the L-glutamate biosynthesis from α-ketoglutarate.
Conclusions
These results and insights provide a foundation for further rational metabolic engineering and bioprocess optimization, enhancing the industrial viability of B. methanolicus for sustainable production of L-glutamate and its derivatives."
Systems Biology,Lowering the switching cost related to the activation of burdensome gene circuits promotes cell population homogeneity and productivity,"Lucas,Vincent,Juan Andres,Julian,Samuel,Andrew,Frank,Lucas,Vincent,Juan Andres,Julian,Samuel,Andrew,Frank,Lucas,Vincent,Juan Andres,Julian,Samuel,Andrew","The activation of gene circuits can impose a significant burden on cells, leading to heterogeneous expression and reduced productivity. In this work, we focused on the T7 production system in , BL21, a prime example of a burdensome gene circuit, to investigate the main cause for this gene expression heterogeneity and methods to mitigate it. Based on continuous cultivation analyzed and control by automated flow cytometry, we quantified the trade-off between cellular growth and gene expression and tracked the cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression (measured as entropy). We concluded that the growth reduction associated to the activation of the burdensome gene circuit, i.e., the switching cost, is at the origin of the population heterogeneity. The loss of growth rate imposed by the burdensome activation of the gene is compensated at the population level by the overgrowth of less induced cells that safeguard the population by generating entropy. We tried to homogenize the population by pulsing the inducer with increasing frequency but found that the population escapes control through promoter mutation, leading to a genotype exhibiting reduced gene expression, but also, reduced entropy. To engineer a more homogeneous population without sacrificing gene expression, we decreased the switching cost associated to the induction by lowering the quality of the main carbon source. This strategy successfully led to a more homogeneous and productive population. Our approach allows for a precise quantification of the trade-off between growth and gene expression in cell population cultivated under dynamic conditions and highlights the importance of the switching cost for designing efficient approaches of cell population control."
Systems Biology,Metabolic interplay drives population cycles in a cross-feeding microbial community,"Tyler,Christopher A,Ophelia,Tyler,Christopher A,Ophelia,Tyler,Christopher A","Population cycles are prevalent in ecosystems and play key roles in determining their functions. While multiple mechanisms have been theoretically shown to generate population cycles, there are limited examples of mutualisms driving self-sustained oscillations. Using an engineered microbial community that cross-feeds essential amino acids, we experimentally demonstrate cycles in strain abundance that are robust across environmental conditions. A nonlinear dynamical model that incorporates the experimentally observed cross-inhibition of amino acid production recapitulates the population cycles. The model shows that the cycles represent internally generated relaxation oscillations, which emerge when fast resource dynamics with positive feedback drive slow changes in strain abundance. Our findings highlight the critical role of resource dynamics and feedback in shaping population cycles in microbial communities and have implications for biotechnology."

Pharmacology and Toxicology,Independent derivations of the axis of arrhythmia for predicting drug-induced torsades de pointes,"Stewart,Jamie I,Adam P,Stewart,Jamie I,Adam P,Stewart,Jamie I","Torsades de pointes is a potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmia that may be caused by many classes of drugs. The likelihood of arrhythmia depends upon the particular combination of cardiac ion-channels that the drug targets. The risk for a given drug can be measured against the axis of arrhythmia, which is a conceptual line in the parameter space of ventricular cardiomyocyte electrophysiology. The axis describes the most potent combination of ion-channel blocks that is theoretically possible. It thus serves as a convenient yardstick for quantifying the pro-arrhythmic risk of novel drugs from their channel-blocking profiles. To date, the axis of arrhythmia has only been derived from biophysical computer simulations. Here, we derive the axis directly from the response profiles of selected ion-channels to known drugs (n=109). The new method provides an independent line of evidence for estimating the axis of arrhythmia. Using step-wise reduction, the two methods were found to converge to identical estimates of the axis in two ion-currents , and ,. The resulting axis predicted the pro-arrhythmic risk of the test drugs with 89.9% to 91.7% accuracy, depending on the dose at which the drug was assessed. The axis of arrhythmia offers a practical method for predicting the pro-arrhythmic risk of novel drugs without the need for drug-specific computer simulations. It is the only metric of pro-arrhythmic risk that has been derived from both a biophysical model and a purely statistical model. It thus combines the benefits of biophysical interpretation and computational efficiency in assessing the torsadogenic risk of new drugs prior to clinical trials."

Discovery of effective small molecule drugs to prevent and/or treat sepsis is a priority. To identify potential sepsis drug candidates, we used an optimized larval zebrafish model of endotoxicity/sepsis (,) to screen commercial libraries of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved drugs and other active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) known to affect pathways implicated in the initiation and progression of sepsis in humans (i.e., inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, coagulation, and apoptosis). We induced endotoxicity in 3- and 5-day post fertilization larval zebrafish (characterized by mortality and tail fin edema (vascular leakage)) by immersion exposure to , 60 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 hours, then screened for the rescue potential of 644 selected drugs simultaneously with LPS at 10 μM. After LPS exposure, we used a neurobehavioral assay (light-dark test) to further evaluate rescue from endotoxicity and to determine possible off-target drug side effects. We identified 29 drugs with > 60% rescue of tail edema and mortality. Three drugs (Ketanserin, Tegaserod, and Brexpiprazole) produced 100% rescue and did not differ from the controls in the light-dark test, suggesting a lack of off-target neurobehavioral effects. Further testing of these three drugs at a nearly 100% lethal concentration of , LPS (45 μg/mL) showed 100% rescue from mortality and 88%-100% mitigation against tail edema. The success of the three identified drugs in a zebrafish endotoxicity/sepsis model warrants further evaluation in mammalian sepsis models."
Pharmacology and Toxicology,Cholesterol differentially modulates the activity of opioid and muscarinic receptors via common non-canonical binding site,"Nikolai,Alena,Dominik,Jan,Nikolai,Alena,Dominik,Jan,Nikolai,Alena,Dominik","G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane proteins representing the largest and most therapeutically targeted receptor class for 30% of currently marketed drugs. Two binding motifs for membrane cholesterol, the ‘cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus (CRAC) domain and ‘cholesterol consensus motif’ (CCM), were postulated. Using a simulation of molecular dynamics we demonstrate the binding of membrane cholesterol to non-canonical sites, distinct from CRAC and CCM, at muscarinic and opioid receptors. We identified a binding site common for muscarinic and opioid receptors at TM6, arginine 6.35 being the principal residue. Effects of depletion of membrane cholesterol on the functional responses of these receptors correlated with effects of mutations arginine 6.35 on functional responses. Exploiting cholesterol-binding sites and variations in receptor-membrane interactions brings novel pharmacotherapeutic opportunities including tissue-specific targeting for sterol-based modulators."

Zebrafish embryos are exempt from certain animal testing regulations which facilitates their use in toxicological testing. Next to the zebrafish embryo acute toxicity test (ZFET) according to the OECD TG 236, fish embryos are used in mechanistic investigations, chemical screenings, in ecotoxicology, and drug development. However, inconsistencies in the applied test protocols and the monitored endpoints in addition to a lack of standardized data formats, impede comprehensive meta-analyses and cross-study comparisons. To address these challenges, we developed the Integrated Effect Database for Toxicological Observations (INTOB), a comprehensive data management tool that standardizes collection of metadata and phenotypic observations using a controlled vocabulary. By incorporating data from more than 600 experiments into the database and subsequent comprehensive data analyses, we demonstrate its utility in improving the comparability and interoperability of toxicity data. Our results show that the ZFET can detect toxicity spanning seven orders of magnitude at the scale of effect concentrations. We also highlight the potential of read-across analyses based on morphological fingerprints and their connection to chemical modes of action, provide information on control variability of the ZFET, and highlight the importance of time for mechanistic understanding in chemical exposure-effect assessments. We provide the full FAIR dataset as well as the analysis workflow and demonstrate how professional data management, as enabled with INTOB, marks a significant advancement by offering a comprehensive framework for the systematic use of zebrafish embryo toxicity data, thus paving the way for more reliable, data-driven chemical risk assessment."

Herein, we describe the ,H-labeling of a non-nucleotide P2Y,R antagonist AZ12464237, and its , binding properties to the receptor in membrane preparations form transfected cells, as well as on mouse brain tissues. The radioligand shows high affinity toward both the human and rat P2Y,R in transfected cells, with , values of 3.12 ± 0.70 nM (human) and 16.6 ± 3.4 nM (rat), as determined by saturation binding studies. The binding kinetics of [,H]AZ12464237 are rapid with a short target residence time (∼1 min). We further confirmed the selectivity of the radioligand by performing competitive displacement studies, in which reported P2Y,R ligands and other P2Y receptors ligands were tested for binding against [,H]AZ12464237. Additionally, the radioligand proved useful for , autoradiography studies on mouse brain tissues, although a small amount of off-target binding was observed in P2Y,R knock-out mice.

Physiology,"Greater distal activation of the biceps femoris long head during knee flexion and hip extension tasks reflects differences in peripheral, not central, motor unit properties.","Jose Carlos dos Santos,Helio V.,Francesco,Liliam Fernandes,Jose Carlos dos Santos,Helio V.,Francesco,Liliam Fernandes,Jose Carlos dos Santos,Helio V.,Francesco","Purpose: Recent research has explored region-specific responses within the biceps femoris long head. However, evidence regarding regional muscle activation remains controversial, primarily because information derived solely from surface electromyograms (sEMG) amplitude does not necessarily provide an accurate estimate of neural drive to the muscle. To address this limitation, this study investigated whether there are proximodistal differences in the motor unit properties of the biceps femoris long head during isometric hip extension and knee flexion tasks. Methods: Seventeen resistance-trained males performed isometric knee flexion and hip extension tasks at 20% and 40% of maximal voluntary contraction. High-density sEMG were recorded from the proximal and distal regions of the biceps femoris long head and decomposed into individual motor units. Central motor unit properties (mean discharge rate, discharge rate variability, recruitment and de-recruitment thresholds) and peripheral properties (motor unit action potential amplitude and conduction velocity) were analyzed. Bipolar sEMG amplitude was also calculated for each region to simulate traditional sEMG measurements. Results: Bipolar sEMG amplitude, motor unit action potential amplitude and conduction velocity were significantly greater in the distal region during both tasks. In contrast, no proximodistal differences were observed in central motor unit properties. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the increased bipolar sEMG amplitude in the distal region of the biceps femoris long head is driven by peripheral motor unit properties rather than differences in central modulation, likely influenced by intra-muscular variations in muscle mechanics. This emphasizes the limitations of relying solely on sEMG amplitude to infer neural control strategies."

Mitochondria, crucial for stress adaptation and energy production, may link psychosocial stress to its biological effects, especially during pregnancy when energy demands significantly increase. This study explores two mitochondrial markers-circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf-mtDNA) and Growth Differentiation Factor-15 (GDF15)-as potential mitochondrial health indicators linking maternal distress to pregnancy outcomes in two longitudinal studies from the USA and Turkey.
Methods: We analyzed biological, demographic, and psychological data from women in two pregnancy studies: EPI (N=187, USA, Mean age=29.6(SD=6.2) and BABIP (N=198, Turkey, Mean age=32.4(SD=4.0)). Data were collected at multiple time points during the perinatal period, including late 2nd and 3rd trimester, with EPI also including additional data at early 2nd trimester and 4-14 months postpartum. Prenatal maternal psychological distress was measured as perceived stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Plasma cf-mtDNA and GDF15 levels were assessed using qPCR and ELISA, respectively. Statistical analyses included Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, Spearman correlations, and Mann-Whitney tests.
Results: Plasma cf-mtDNA levels did not change significantly during pregnancy in either study. Plasma GDF15 levels increased from early to late pregnancy in both studies and significantly decreased postpartum in EPI. Perinatal maternal distress in the late 2nd and 3rd trimesters was not associated with cf-mtDNA or GDF15 in either study. Metabolic distress, measured as higher pre-pregnancy BMI, was negatively correlated with GDF15 in the late 2nd trimester in EPI and showed a similar trend in BABIP. Similarly, higher maternal psychological distress in the early 2nd trimester were associated with lower cf-mtDNA and a trend for lower GDF15 in EPI. Finally, higher pre-pregnancy BMI and maternal distress in late pregnancy were linked to a smaller decline in GDF15 from late pregnancy to postpartum in EPI, suggesting an interaction between metabolic stress, prenatal distress and post-pregnancy physiological recovery. 
Conclusions: This study identified distinct patterns of plasma cf-mtDNA and GDF15 levels during the perinatal period across studies from two countries, revealing unique associations between maternal characteristics, prenatal distress, and pregnancy outcomes, suggesting that maternal distress can interact with energy mobilization during pregnancy."

Recent evidence has shown that SCRAs with key moieties can confer superagonism, yet this phenomenon is still not well understood. In this study, we developed a structure-activity relationship (SAR) for SCRA superagonism by comparing eight compounds differing by their head moiety (l-valinate vs. l-,-leucinate), core moiety (indole vs. indazole), and tail moiety (5-fluoropentyl vs. 4-fluorobenzyl) through different modes of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). We found that l-,-leucinate head moiety and indazole core moiety conferred superagonism across multiple Gα, proteins and β-arrestin 2. Finally, after generating CB1R mutant constructs, we found that transmembrane 2 (TM2) interactions to the head moiety of tested SCRAs at F170, F177, and H178 are key to eliciting activity."

Alteration of this structure plays a central role in cardiac arrhythmias, notably arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), an inherited genetic disorder of desmosomes. Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Serine Protein Kinase (CASK), a costameric component of the lateral membrane, regulates cardiomyocyte protein trafficking. Here, we investigated CASK regulation of the organization of ID components in normal and pathological contexts. Here, we investigated CASK regulation of the organization of ID components in normal and pathological contexts.
Methods: We studied the outcomes of CASK depletion in neonatal rat hearts using a cardiac-specific adeno-associated virus strategy. We used conventional and strain echocardiography, hemodynamics, electrocardiography, histology, and gene and protein expression studies to characterize adult rat hearts. We also studied the effects of CASK depletion in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVM), and control and ACM (PKP2+/-) IPS cell-derived CM (hIPS-CM) using proteomics, electron microscopy, high-resolution imaging, mechano-scanning ion conductance microscopy (mechano-SICM), and stress resistance tests. We studied cardiac CASK expression and localization in human ACM and non-transplantable control hearts.
Results: Depletion of CASK in our multiple experimental models revealed that CASK regulates cardiomyocyte IDs. In rats, CASK depletion improved contractile reserve and compliance. In cultured rat cardiomyocytes, CASK knockdown increased localization of connexin 43 (Cx43) and PKP2 at IDs, resulting in increased contact stiffness. In PKP2+/- hIPS-CMs, CASK expression was increased. CASK depletion in these cells promoted PKP2 accumulation at cell contacts, formation of desmosome-like structures, and stress resistance. In the right ventricles of ACM patients, CASK protein level was also increased and CASK abnormally localized at the ID.
Conclusion: CASK functions as a repressor of ID organization and tissue cohesion, suggesting novel mechanisms for regulating ID structure and function. These observations, along with CASK upregulation and mislocalization in ACM, open up new perspectives on understanding the pathophysiology of ACM and suggest innovative strategies for its treatment."
Systems Biology,Scalable enumeration and sampling of minimal metabolic pathways for organisms and communities,"Ove,Axel,Jörg,Ove,Axel,Jörg,Ove,Axel","Many interactions in microbial consortia or tissues of multicellular organisms rely on networks of metabolite exchanges. To predict community function and composition beyond statistical correlations, one can use genome-scale metabolic models. However, comprehensive model analysis via metabolic pathways is a major challenge because pathway counts grow combinatorially with model size. Here, we define minimal pathways that yield compact representations of metabolic network capabilities. They generalize existing pathway concepts by allowing inhomogeneous constraints and targeted analysis of subnetworks, and we show how to enumerate and sample them efficiently via iterative minimization and pathway graphs. This enables applications such as assessing quantitative gene essentiality in the central metabolism of ,, predicting metabolite exchanges associated with homeostasis and health in a host-microbe model of the human gut, and designing butyrate-producing microbial communities. Minimal pathways enable scalable analysis of metabolic subnetworks such as metabolite exchanges in uni- and multicellular systems."
Systems Biology,Energy-based Analysis of Biochemical Oscillators Using Bond Graphs and Linear Control Theory,"Peter J.,Michael,Peter J.,Michael,Peter J.","The bond graph approach has been recognised as a useful conceptual basis for understanding the behaviour of living entities modelled as a system with hierarchical interacting parts exchanging energy. One such behaviour is oscillation, which underpins many essential biological functions. In this paper, energy-based modelling of biochemical systems using the bond graph approach is combined with classical feedback control theory to give a novel approach to the analysis, and potentially synthesis, of biochemical oscillators. It is shown that oscillation is dependent on the interplay between , and , feedback and this interplay is formalised using classical frequency-response analysis of feedback systems. In particular, the , is suggested as a simple scalar indicator of the presence or absence of oscillations; it is shown how this indicator can be used to investigate the effect of both the structure and parameters of biochemical system on oscillation. It follows that the combination of classical feedback control theory and the bond graph approach to systems biology gives a novel analysis and design methodology for biochemical oscillators."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can regulate the expression of transcription factors at the post-transcriptional level. The interactions between SOX10 and its targeting miRNAs form network motifs such as feedforward and feedback loops. Such motifs can result in non-linear dynamics in gene expression levels, therefore playing a crucial role in regulating tumor proliferation and metastasis as well as tumor’s responses to therapies. Here, we reviewed and discussed the intricate interplay between SOX10 and miRNAs in melanoma biology including melanogenesis, phenotype switch, and therapy resistance. Additionally, we investigated the gene regulatory interactions in melanoma, identifying crucial network motifs that involve both SOX10 and miRNAs. We also analyzed the expression levels of the components within these motifs. From a control theory perspective, we explained how these dynamics are linked to the phenotypic plasticity of melanoma cells. In summary, we underscored the importance of employing a data-driven network biology approach to elucidate the complex regulatory mechanisms and identify driver network motifs within the melanoma network. This methodology facilitates a deeper understanding of the regulation of SOX10 by miRNAs in melanoma. The insight gained could potentially contribute to the development of miRNA-based treatments for SOX10, thereby enhancing the clinical management of this malignancy."

To investigate the role of altered α-adrenergic stimulation on cardiac function, we developed a short-term exposure model, administering phenylephrine subcutaneously to mice for one week. Compared to vehicle-injected controls, phenylephrine-treated animals exhibited increased ejection fraction, decreased chamber size, diastolic dysfunction and ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of hypertension. Remarkably, these animals developed extensive fibrotic remodeling of the tissue that plateaued at 24 hours and myocyte hypertrophy localized to regions of fibrotic deposition after 3 days of treatment. Transcriptome analyses of purified myocyte and fibroblast populations from these hearts revealed an unexpected role for myocytes in the production of extracellular matrix. Comparison with other models of cardiac stress, including pressure overload hypertrophy and cytokine activation of fibroblasts, identified stimulus-specific transcriptional circuits associated with cardiac pathology. Given the rapid, robust fibrotic response that preceded myocyte hypertrophy, intercellular communication analyses were conducted to investigate fibroblast to myocyte signaling, identifying potential crosstalk between these cells. These studies thoroughly describe and phenotypically characterize a new model of short-term catecholamine stress and provide an atlas of transcriptional remodeling in myocytes and fibroblasts."

This method utilizes enzyme activity as control parameters, exploiting the inherent property of enzymes to enhance reaction rates without affecting thermodynamic potentials.

Disruptions in this process can cause replication stress which is aberrant in many pathologies including cancer. Despite this, little is known about the mechanisms governing the temporal regulation of DNA replication initiation, thought to be related to the limited copy number of firing factors. Here, we present a high (1-kilobase) resolution stochastic model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae whole-genome replication in which origins compete to associate with limited firing factors. After developing an algorithm to fit this model to replication timing data, we validated the model by reproducing experimental inter-origin distances, origin efficiencies, and replication fork directionality. This suggests the model accurately simulates the aspects of DNA replication most important for determining its dynamics. We also use the model to predict measures of DNA replication dynamics which are yet to be determined experimentally and investigate the potential impacts of variations in firing factor concentrations on DNA replication."
Cell Biology,Citrate synthase improves sepsis-induced lung injury by reconstructing the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle of macrophages,"Jiaojiao,Sihao,Zhiqiang,Jiaojiao,Sihao,Zhiqiang,Jiaojiao,Sihao","Background: The destruction of mitochondrial function during sepsis-induced acute lung injury (sepsis-ALI) can lead to tissue cell damage and organ dysfunction. Citrate synthase (CS) may maintain cellular energy metabolism by enhancing the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) in macrophages. 
Methods: 76 healthy donors and 89 sepsis patients were included. The levels of CS were determined using ELISA. We established a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis to evaluate the effects of CS on lung injury by lung macrophages-specific CS knockdown or CS inhibitors. Isolated mouse lung macrophages were stimulated with LPS to observe the impact of CS overexpression and knockdown on TCA cycle.
Results: In sepsis patients, CS was expressed at low levels and positively correlates with lung function parameters. In sepsis mice, knockdown CS or inhibiting its expression exacerbated lung injury and oxidative stress. In macrophages, inhibiting CS expression affected TCA cycle and worsened cell apoptosis, while overexpressing CS promoted TCA cycle, alleviating cell apoptosis, enhancing cellular energy production, and reducing oxidative stress levels. The supplementation of citric acid (a downstream metabolite of CS) helped alleviate mitochondrial damage and promotes the TCA cycle. 
Conclusions: These results suggest that targeting CS may be a promising therapeutic approach for treating sepsis."
Systems Biology,A global resource constrained model to predict metabolic flux dynamics in fluctuating environments,"Huili,Yang,Xiongfei,Huili,Yang,Xiongfei,Huili,Yang","Environmental changes often induce global variations on bacterial gene expression, frequently accompanied by alterations in growth rates. Integrating non-metabolic cellular processes, such as gene expression and macromolecule synthesis, with metabolic modeling remains a significant challenge in systems biology due to the lack of mechanistic representation of gene regulation. Here, we introduce a novel constraint-based modeling framework called dynamic Constrained Allocation Flux Balance Analysis (dCAFBA), which comprehensively integrates metabolism, cellular resource allocation, and gene regulation. We employ a quasi-steady-state assumption, positing that reaction fluxes achieve balance at each time step, adapting more rapidly than protein synthesis and growth dilution. This approach enables the prediction of reaction flux dynamics and protein allocation necessary to achieve cellular objectives, such as optimizing growth during various growth shifts (including carbon, amino acid, and transcriptional signal), without detailing molecular gene regulations. Our model offers a new method for interpreting proteome allocation and cellular metabolism in complex and transient environments, providing mechanistic insights valuable for metabolic engineering."

Cell Biology,Visualizing developmental dynamics of nuclear morphology and transport machinery in Drosophila,"Yuki,Shruthi,Amanda A,Yuki,Shruthi,Amanda A,Yuki,Shruthi","Communication between the cytoplasm and the nucleus requires a continuous exchange of molecules across the nuclear envelope (NE). The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the gateway embedded in the NE through which cargo moves, while transport receptors mediate the passage of macromolecules through the NPC. Although their essential role as the components of the nuclear transport machinery has been extensively studied, how these factors respond to developmental and environmental cues has been underexplored. Here we tag the nucleoporin Nup96 and the transport receptor Impβ with mEGFP and mScarlet-I at their endogenous loci in Drosophila. We demonstrate the functionality of these markers in multiple tissues and offer new options for better visualization of nuclear morphology in densely packed, complex tissues. Then, we characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of these markers in multiple developmental contexts. We find that Nup96 and Impβ form cytoplasmic puncta, whose size, numbers, and co-localization patterns change dynamically during oogenesis and early embryogenesis. Moreover, we find that the abundance of NPCs per nucleus decreases during early embryogenesis, complementing the emerging model in which NPCs play a regulatory role in development. The tools and observations described here will be useful in understanding the dynamic regulation of nuclear morphology and transport machinery in development."

Without additional nutrients, a few stationary-phase cells synchronously enter mitosis, increasing the population viability that does not likely result from mutations. VRQT is a population density-dependent collective behavior that can be triggered by quorum sensing aromatic alcohols. Genetic analyses demonstrate that VRQT is independent of many canonical pathways for cell growth, development, or stress responses. This community survival program allows yeast to proactively extend vitality amidst a common nutritional crisis. Wild strains isolated from clinical samples exhibit VRQT, suggesting that this survival mechanism must be considered when treating human infections."
Immunology,Th1 polarization in Bordetella pertussis vaccine responses is maintained through a positive feedback loop,"Lisa,Jiyeun,Pramod,Ferran,Minori,Shelby,Mari,Ricardo da Silva,Alessandro,Bjoern,Lisa,Jiyeun,Pramod,Ferran,Minori,Shelby,Mari,Ricardo da Silva,Alessandro,Bjoern,Lisa,Jiyeun,Pramod,Ferran,Minori,Shelby,Mari,Ricardo da Silva,Alessandro","Outbreaks of Bordetella pertussis (BP), the causative agent of whooping cough, continue despite broad vaccination coverage and have been increasing since vaccination switched from whole-BP (wP) to acellular BP (aP) vaccines. wP vaccination has been associated with more durable protective immunity and an induced Th1 polarized memory T cell response. Here, a multi-omics approach was applied to profile the immune response of 30 wP and 31 aP-primed individuals and identify correlates of T cell polarization before and after Tdap booster vaccination. We found that transcriptional changes indicating an interferon response on day 1 post-booster along with elevated plasma concentrations of IFN-γ and interferon-induced chemokines that peaked at day 1-3 post-booster correlated best with the Th1 polarization of the vaccine-induced memory T cell response on day 28. Our studies suggest that wP-primed individuals maintain their Th1 polarization through this early memory interferon response. This suggests that stimulating the interferon pathway during vaccination could be an effective strategy to elicit a predominant Th1 response in aP-primed individuals that protects better against infection."
Immunology,Longitudinal profiling of B cells primed by mRNA vaccine and recalled by Omicron variants uncovers antibodies broadly neutralizing sarbecoviruses,"Xixian,Ling,Ruiping,Zuowei,Yunjian,Yi,Rongrong,Hualong,Lin,Xuanyi,Maosheng,Xueyan,Liwei,Teng,Xixian,Ling,Ruiping,Zuowei,Yunjian,Yi,Rongrong,Hualong,Lin,Xuanyi,Maosheng,Xueyan,Liwei,Teng,Xixian,Ling,Ruiping,Zuowei,Yunjian,Yi,Rongrong,Hualong,Lin,Xuanyi,Maosheng,Xueyan,Liwei","Regarding to the impact of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 immune imprinting on antibody responses to emerging variants, to what extent memory B cells elicited by wild-type (WT) spike can develop neutralizing breadth and potency in immune recalls is a key question. Here, we longitudinally tracked B cells recognizing WT spike in two individuals of mRNA vaccine, from convalescence of breakthrough infection to acute phase of reinfection. Comprehensive characterization of 632 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from those B cells reveals that mAbs cloned after reinfection have dramatically enhanced neutralizing breadth and potency, including 11 mAbs that potently neutralize all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants from WT to KP.3. Among the 11 mAbs, 5 mAbs are classified into public clonotypes encoded by IGHV3-53 or IGHV3-66, whereas the rest belong to a rarely reported clonotype encoded by IGHV3-74. Notably, IGHV3-74 mAbs can neutralize SARS-CoV-1 with a minimum IC50 of 0.055 μg/ml. Structural and functional analysis further suggests that IGHV3-74 mAbs target a novel epitope on receptor-binding domain and the best mAb, termed KXD352, is highly resilient to variations on this epitope. Overall, this study demonstrates that both public and rare antibody clonotypes primed by prototype mRNA vaccine can achieve extraordinary neutralizing breadth and potency in repeated Omicron infections."

High-quality training data is essential for clinical models. Existing deep learning models focus on prediction performance but lack interpretability. We introduce Pep2Vec, a modular, transformer-based model trained on MHC I and II ligandome data, transforming input sequences into interpretable vectors. This approach integrates source protein features and elucidates the source of its performance gains, revealing regions that correlate with gene expression and protein-protein interactions. Pep2Vec's peptide latent space shows relationships between peptides of varying MHC class, allotype, lengths, and submotifs. This enables identifying four major contaminant types, constituting 5.0% of our data. Pep2Vec enhances MHC presentation prediction, achieving higher average precision on our presentation test set and immunogenicity datasets than existing models, and reducing contaminant-like peptide recommendations. Pep2Vec addresses a critical need for the development of more precise and effective applications of peptide MHC models, such as for cancer vaccines and antibody deimmunization."

Here we report a comprehensive single-cell RNA-seq and T cell receptor (TCR)-seq analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood from a cohort of treatment-naive MS patients and control participants.  A small subset of highly expanded and activated CD8+ T cells were enriched in the CSF in MS that displayed high activation, cytotoxicity and tissue-homing transcriptional profiles.  Using a combination of unbiased and targeted antigen discovery approaches, MS-derived CD8+ T cell clonotypes recognizing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigens and multiple novel mimotopes were identified.  These findings shed vital insight into the role of CD8+ T cells in MS and pave the way towards disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets."
Immunology,Epigenetic trajectory predicts development of clinical rheumatoid arthritis in ACPA+ individuals: Targeting Immune Responses for Prevention of Rheumatoid Arthritis (TIP-RA),"E. Barton,David L.,Eunice,Jane H.,William H.,V. Michael,Kevin D.,Gary S.,Wei,E. Barton,David L.,Eunice,Jane H.,William H.,V. Michael,Kevin D.,Gary S.,Wei,E. Barton,David L.,Eunice,Jane H.,William H.,V. Michael,Kevin D.,Gary S.","Objective
The presence of autoantibodies to citrullinated protein antigens (ACPAs) in the absence of clinically-apparent inflammatory arthritis (IA) identifies individuals at-risk for developing future clinical rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, it is unclear why some ACPA+ individuals convert to clinical RA while others do not. We explored the possibility in the Targeting Immune Responses for Prevention of Rheumatoid Arthritis (TIP-RA) study that epigenetic remodeling is part of the trajectory from an at-risk state to clinical disease and identifies novel biomarkers associated with conversion to clinical RA.
Methods
ACPA- Controls, ACPA+ At-Risk, and Early RA individuals were followed for up to 5 years, including obtaining blood samples annually and at RA diagnosis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated into CD19+ B cells, memory CD4+ T cells, and naive CD4+ T cells using antibodies and magnetic beads. Genome-wide methylation within each cell lineage was assayed using the Illumina MethylationEPIC v1.0 beadchip. ACPA+ At-Risk participants who did or did not develop RA were designated Pre-RA or Non-converters, respectively. Differentially methylated loci (DML) were selected using the Limma software package. Using the Caret package, we constructed machine learning models in test and validation cohorts and identified the most predictive loci of clinical RA conversion.
Results
Cross-sectional differential methylation analysis at baseline revealed DMLs that distinguish the Pre-RA methylome from ACPA+ Non-converters, the latter which closely resembled ACPA- Controls. Genes overlapping these DMLs correspond to aberrant NOTCH signaling and DNA repair pathways in B cells. Longitudinal analysis showed that ACPA- Control and ACPA+ Non-converter methylomes are relatively constant. In contrast, the Pre-RA methylome remodeled along a dynamic RA methylome trajectory characterized by epigenetic changes in active regulatory elements. Clinical conversion to RA, defined based on diagnosis, marked an epigenetic inflection point for cell cycle pathways in B cells and adaptive immunity pathways in naive T cells. Machine learning revealed individual loci associated with RA conversion. This model significantly outperformed autoantibodies plus acute phase reactants as predictors of RA conversion.
Conclusion
DNA methylation is a dynamic process in ACPA+ individuals at-risk for developing RA that eventually transition to clinical disease. In contrast, non-converters and controls have stable methylomes. The accumulation of epigenetic marks over time prior to conversion to clinical RA conforms to pathways that are associated with immunity and can be used to identify potential pathogenic pathways for therapeutic targeting and/or use as prognostic biomarkers."

Immunology,The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)-Immune Network in People Living With HIV,"Bridget R,Mitali,Maya,Niyati,Gabriela,Gina,Kaitlyn,Jinging,Zhihong,Mary Catherine,Jessica,Bridget R,Mitali,Maya,Niyati,Gabriela,Gina,Kaitlyn,Jinging,Zhihong,Mary Catherine,Jessica,Bridget R,Mitali,Maya,Niyati,Gabriela,Gina,Kaitlyn,Jinging,Zhihong,Mary Catherine","Background and Objectives: Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated direct influences of the sympathetic and vagal/parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) on the immune system. The relevance of these pathways to the development of inflammatory disorders in humans remains unknown.  We hypothesized that a comprehensive examination of the ANS-immune network in patients with HIV, would reveal that the type and severity of autonomic neuropathy (AN) would predict immune phenotypes with distinct clinical and demographic characteristics.    
Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of 79 adult people with a history of well-controlled HIV on stable combination antiretroviral treatment (CART) recruited from a primary care clinic network within the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. All participants underwent a standardized battery of autonomic function tests summarized as the Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS) and vagal and adrenergic baroreflex sensitivity (BRS-V and BRS-A). Immune profiling included: 1) measurement of interleukin-6 (IL-6) as part of the Olink assay Target 96 Inflammation Panel, 2) non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering analyses on Olink immune biomarkers, and 3) mass cytometry (CyTOF) on a subset of participants with and without autonomic neuropathy (N = 10).  
Results: Reduced activity of caudal vagal circuitry involved in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) predicted higher levels of IL-6 (Spearman's rho = -0.352, p=0.002). The comprehensive assessment of the ANS-immune network showed four immunotypes defined by NMF analyses. A pro-inflammatory immunotype defined by elevations in type 1 cytokines (IL-6, IL-17) and increased numbers of CD8+ T-cells was associated with autonomic neuropathy (AN). This association was driven by deficits in the cardiovascular sympathetic nervous system and remained strongly significant after controlling for the older age and greater burden of co-morbid illness among participants with this immunotype (aOR=4.7, p=0.017).  
Discussion:  Our results provide novel support for the clinical relevance of the CAP in patients with chronic inflammatory AN. These data also provide insight regarding the role of the sympathetic nervous system and aging in the progression and development of co-morbidities in patients with chronic HIV and support future research aimed at developing therapies focused on modulation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic/vagal nervous system."

In this work, we compare and contrast intranasal (i.n.) and intramuscular (i.m.) administration of a SARS-CoV-2 self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine delivered by a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC). Both i.m. and i.n. vaccines induce potent systemic serum neutralizing antibodies, bone marrow-resident IgG-secreting cells, and splenic T cell responses. The i.n. vaccine additionally induces robust respiratory mucosal immune responses, including SARS-CoV-2-reactive lung-resident memory and lung-homing T cell populations. As a booster following previous i.m. vaccination, the i.n. vaccine also elicits the development of mucosal virus-specific T cells. Both the i.m. and i.n. administered vaccines durably protect hamsters from infection-associated morbidity upon viral challenge, significantly reducing viral loads and preventing challenged hamsters from transmitting virus to naive cagemates. This saRNA-NLC vaccine's potent systemic immunogenicity, and additional mucosal immunogenicity when delivered i.n., may be key for combating SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens."

Advances in interface tissue engineering require stratified biomaterials able to both provide local instructive signals to support multiple tissue phenotypes while also reducing the risk of strain concentrations and failure at the transition between dissimilar materials. Here, we describe adaptation of a thiolated gelatin (Gel-SH) hydrogel via selective amination of carboxylic acid subunits on the gelatin backbone. The magnitude and kinetics of HRP-mediated primary crosslinking and carbodiimide-mediated secondary crosslinking reactions can be tuned through amination and thiolation of carboxylic acid subunits on the gelatin backbone. We also show that a stratified biomaterial comprised of mineralized (bone-mimetic) and non-mineralized (tendon-mimetic) collagen scaffold compartments linked by an aminated Gel-SH hydrogel demonstrate improved mechanical performance and reduced strain concentrations. Together, these results highlight significant mechanical advantages that can be derived from modifying the gelatin macromer via controlled amination and thiolation and suggest an avenue for tuning the mechanical performance of hydrogel interfaces within stratified biomaterials."

Intracellular multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes in combination with activated caspases facilitate production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 beta. Specifically, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) has received heightened attention due to the wide range of stimuli to which it can respond and its potential involvement in AMD. In this study, we directly tested the role of Nlrp3 and its downstream effector, caspase 1 (Casp1) in mediating early AMD-like pathology (i.e., basal laminar deposits [BLamDs]) in wild-type (WT) mice and the Malattia Leventinese/Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy (ML/DHRD) mouse model (p.R345W mutation in Efemp1). Compared to aged-matched controls, R345W+/+ knockin mice demonstrated increased Muller cell gliosis, subretinal Iba-1+ microglial cells, higher Nlrp3 immunoreactivity in the retina, as well as significant transcriptional upregulation of complement component 3, Nlrp3, pro-Il1b, pro-caspase-1, and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 3 in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE)/choroid. These findings were accompanied by an age-related increase in BLamD formation in the R345W+/+ mice. Genetic elimination of either Nlrp3 or Casp1 significantly reduced both the size and coverage of BLamDs in the R345W+/+ background, highlighting an important and underappreciated pathway that could affect ML/DHRD onset and progression. Moreover, Nlrp3 knockout reduced spontaneous, idiopathic BLamDs in WT mice, suggesting translatability of our findings not only to rare inherited retinal dystrophies, but also potentially to AMD itself.  "
Bioengineering,Direct M2 macrophage co-culture overrides viscoelastic hydrogel mechanics to promote fibroblast activation,"Leilani R.,Mackenzie L.,Steven R.,Leilani R.,Mackenzie L.,Steven R.,Leilani R.,Mackenzie L.","Fibroblast activation drives fibrotic diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis. However, the complex interplay of how tissue mechanics and macrophage signals combine to influence fibroblast activation is not well understood. Here, we use hyaluronic acid hydrogels as a tunable cell culture system to mimic lung tissue stiffness and viscoelasticity. We applied this platform to investigate the influence of macrophage signaling on fibroblast activation. Fibroblasts cultured on stiff (50 kPa) hydrogels mimicking fibrotic tissue exhibit increased activation as measured by spreading as well as type I collagen and cadherin-11 expression compared to fibroblasts cultured on soft (1 kPa) viscoelastic hydrogels mimicking normal tissue. These trends were unchanged in fibroblasts cultured with macrophage-conditioned media. However, fibroblasts directly co-cultured with M2 macrophages show increased activation, even on soft viscoelastic hydrogels that normally suppress activation. Inhibition of interleukin 6 (IL6) signaling does not change activation in fibroblast-only cultures but ameliorates the pro-fibrotic effects of M2 macrophage co-culture. These results underscore the ability of direct M2 macrophage co-culture to override hydrogel viscoelasticity to promote fibroblast activation in an IL6-dependent manner. This work also highlights the utility of using hydrogels to deconstruct complex tissue microenvironments to better understand the interplay between microenvironmental mechanical and cellular cues."

Compared to existing methods, real-time detection and long-term monitoring are still required. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have excellent optical properties for sensing applications, which provide the possibility for designing a new generation of glucose sensors. In this study, we describe a method for covalently conjugate glucose oxidase (GOx) on SWCNTs as an optical glucose sensor. The functional groups are introduced by a photocatalytic reaction which acts as the handle for protein loading on SWCNTs. In this sp3 defect reaction, the optical properties of SWCNTs can be maintained. With a convenient bioconjugation reaction, the GOx could be covalently linked with SWCNTs. Compared to the non-covalent immobilization conjugates, the covalent conjugate sensor exhibits a much stronger optical response toward glucose, and the stability of the biosensor also increases in harsh conditions. At the same time, we also report the changing ratio of the original E, and defected E,* peak during the bioconjugation reaction, which is also inspiring for reaction monitoring on SWCNTs."

Compared to the sequence-based tools heavily trained with human ligandome, AF-pred does not show an advantage in predicting the binding patterns of human HLA-II but has far better performance in predicting the binding patterns of other animals' MHC-II. Using recently resolved bat MHC-II structures, we analyzed AF-pred's prediction capability, logic, and limitation. In addition, we also explored the impact of AF algorithm iterations on the prediction of MHC-II restricted epitopes. The results demonstrated that AF-pred is capable of cross-species prediction of MHC-II restricted epitopes and is conducive to the development of novel veterinary vaccines."

However, the mechanisms underlying patient response or resistance to oral JAK inhibitors remain unknown. To elucidate the molecular and cellular pathways activated by tofacitinib in responder and non-responder patients, we generated a longitudinal single-cell RNA sequence dataset profiling both immune and non-immune cell populations from colonic biopsies of UC patients. Our analysis revealed that responders exhibited higher baseline JAK-STAT activity, while non-responders had increased baseline NF-kB pathway activation. Longitudinal comparisons showed that disease progression in non-responders was associated with increased abundance and enhanced activation of macrophages and fibroblasts. Our data suggest that resistance to tofacitinib is mediated by the hyperactivation of myeloid cells, and we identified IL-10-dependent macrophages as a cellular subset contributing to this resistance."

We have taken a pragmatic approach to improving expression and stability of neuraminidase by grafting antigenic surface loops from low-expressing neuraminidase proteins onto high-expressing strains. We generated hybrid proteins bearing the antigenic properties of the loop donor accompanied by the favourable expression, stability, and tetrameric structure of the loop recipient. The hybrid neuraminidase proteins were recognised by a broad set of human monoclonal antibodies induced by influenza infection or vaccination, and grafted loops were superposable in their X-ray structures. Immunisation of mice with neuraminidase hybrids induced inhibitory antibodies to the loop donor and protected against lethal influenza challenge. This pragmatic technique enables improved expression of influenza neuraminidase proteins for vaccine manufacture."

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has accelerated the characterization of cellular phenotypes in the pig respiratory tract under both healthy and diseased conditions. However, combining scRNAseq with recovery of paired T cell receptor (TCR) α and β chains as well as B cell receptor (BCR) heavy and light chains to interrogate their repertoires has not to our knowledge been demonstrated for pigs. Here, we developed primers to enrich porcine TCR α and β chains along with BCR κ and β light chains and IgM, IgA, and IgG heavy chains that are compatible with the 10x Genomics VDJ sequencing protocol. Using these pig-specific assays, we sequenced the T and B cell receptors of cryopreserved lung cells from CD1D-expressing and -deficient pigs after one or two infections with influenza A virus (IAV) to examine whether natural killer T (NKT) cells alter pulmonary TCR and BCR repertoire selection. We also performed paired single-cell RNA and receptor sequencing of FACS-sorted T cells longitudinally sampled from the lungs of IAV-vaccinated and -infected pigs to track clonal expansion in response to IAV exposure. All pigs presented highly diverse repertoires. Pigs re-exposed to influenza antigens from either vaccination or infection exhibited higher numbers of expanded CD4 and CD8 T cell clonotypes with activated phenotypes, suggesting potential IAV reactive T cell populations.

In addition to their lack of alloreactivity, γδ T cells exhibit properties distinct from other lymphocyte subsets, prompting significant interest in their development as an off-the-shelf cellular immunotherapeutic. However, their low abundance in circulation, heterogeneity, limited methods for ex vivo expansion, and under-developed methodologies for genetic modification have hindered basic study and clinical application of γδ T cells. Here, we implement a feeder-free, scalable approach for ex vivo manufacture of polyclonal, non-virally modified, gene edited chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-γδ T cells in support of therapeutic application. Engineered CAR-γδ T cells demonstrate high function in vitro and and in vivo. Longitudinal in vivo pharmacokinetic profiling of adoptively transferred polyclonal CAR-γδ T cells uncover subset-specific responses to IL-15 cytokine armoring and multiplex base editing. Our results present a robust platform for genetic modification of polyclonal CAR-γδ T cells and present unique opportunities to further define synergy and the contribution of discrete, engineered CAR-γδ T cell subsets to therapeutic efficacy in vivo."
Immunology,Head-to-head comparison of nuclear imaging approaches to quantify tumor CD8,"Gerwin G.W.,Rene,Ines F.,Milou,Lenneke,Gerben M.,Janneke,Peter J.,Iris M.,Erik F.J.,Johan,Gosse,Martijn,Erik H.J.G.,Sandra,Gerwin G.W.,Rene,Ines F.,Milou,Lenneke,Gerben M.,Janneke,Peter J.,Iris M.,Erik F.J.,Johan,Gosse,Martijn,Erik H.J.G.,Sandra,Gerwin G.W.,Rene,Ines F.,Milou,Lenneke,Gerben M.,Janneke,Peter J.,Iris M.,Erik F.J.,Johan,Gosse,Martijn,Erik H.J.G.","Many immunotherapies focus on (re)invigorating CD8, T cell anti-cancer responses and different nuclear imaging techniques have been developed to measure CD8, T cell distributions. In vivo labeling approaches using radiotracers primarily show CD8, T cell distributions, while ex vivo labeled CD8, T cells can show CD8, T cell migration patterns, homing, and tumor infiltration. Currently, a comprehensive head-to-head comparison of in vivo and ex- vivo cell labeling with respect to their tumor and normal tissue targeting properties and correlation to the presence of CD8, T cells is lacking, yet essential for correct interpretation of clinical CD8, imaging applications. Therefore, we performed a head-to-head comparison of three different CD8, T cell imaging approaches: 1) ,Zr-labeled DFO-conjugated Fc-silent anti-CD8 antibody ([,Zr]Zr-anti-CD8-IgG2a,), 2) ex vivo ,Zr-oxine labeled ovalbumin-specific CD8, T cells ([,Zr]Zr-OT-I cells), and 3) ,F-labeled IL2 ([,F]AlF-RESCA-IL2).
Methods
B16F10/OVA tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice (n=10/group) received intravenously one of the three radiopharmaceuticals. PET/CT images were acquired starting 72 h ([,Zr]Zr-anti-CD8-IgG2a,), 24 and 48 h ([,Zr]Zr-OT-I cells), and 10 min ([,F]AlF-RESCA-IL2) post injection. Subsequently, ex vivo biodistribution analysis of the radiopharmaceuticals was performed followed by flow cytometric analysis to evaluate the number of intratumoral CD8, T cells. Additionally, the intratumoral radiolabel distributions was assessed by autoradiography and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tumor slices.
Results
[,Zr]Zr-anti-CD8-IgG2a,, [,Zr]Zr-OT-I cells, and [,F]AlF-RESCA-IL2 showed uptake in CD8-rich tissues, with preferential targeting to the spleen. Biodistribution analysis showed tumor uptake above blood level for all radiopharmaceuticals, except [,F]AlF-RESCA-IL2. For all three approaches, the uptake in the tumor-draining lymph node was significantly higher compared with the contralateral axial lymph node, suggesting that all approaches allow evaluation of immune responses involving CD8, T cells. Tumor uptake of [,Zr]Zr-anti-CD8-IgG2a, (R,=0.65, p<0.01) and [,Zr]Zr-OT-I cells (R,=0.74, p<0.01) correlated to the number of intratumoral CD8, T cells (flow cytometry). The intratumoral distribution pattern of the radiosignal was different for ex vivo and in vivo radiolabeling techniques. The short half-life of ,F precluded autoradiography assessment of [,F]AlF-RESCA-IL2.
Conclusion
We show that [,Zr]Zr-anti-CD8-IgG2a, and [,Zr]Zr-OT-I cells PET/CT imaging can be used to evaluate intratumoral CD8, T cells, even though their normal tissues and intratumoral distribution patterns are significantly different. Based on their characteristics, [,Zr]Zr-anti-CD8-IgG2a, might be most useful to immunophenotyping the TME, while the ex vivo cell labeling approach visualizes CD8, T cell migrations patterns and the permissiveness of tumors for invasion, whereas [,F]AlF-RESCA-IL2 allows for rapid recurrent imaging and might prove useful for tracking rapid changes in CD8, T cell distributions. In conclusion, our head-to-head comparison of the three prototype CD8, T cell labeling approaches provides new insights which can aid in correct interpretation of clinical CD8 imaging and may guide in the selection of the optimal imaging approach for the research question of interest."

Constantly secreted into the lumen of the intestine, IgA binds commensal microbiota to regulate their colonization and function, with unclear implications for health. IgA deficiency is common in humans but is difficult to study due to its complex aetiology and comorbidities,. Using genetically and environmentally controlled mice, here we show that IgA-deficient animals have increased susceptibility to endogenous colorectal tumours. Cellular and molecular analyses revealed that, in the absence of IgA, colonic epithelial cells induce antibacterial factors and accelerate cell cycling in response to the microbiota. Oral treatment with IgA was sufficient to both reduce steady-state proliferation and protect mice from tumours, but this function was due to antibody structure rather than binding specificity. In both organoid and monolayer culture systems, IgA directly suppressed epithelial growth. Co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and a targeted CRISPR screen identified DMBT1 as an IgA-binding epithelial surface protein required for IgA-mediated suppression of proliferation. Together, IgA and DMBT1 regulate Notch signalling and tune the normal cycling of absorptive colonocyte progenitors. In mice, deleting the transmembrane and cytoplasmic signalling portions of DMBT1 or blocking Notch signalling was sufficient to reverse both the increased proliferation and tumour susceptibility of IgA knockouts. These experiments establish a homeostatic function for IgA in tempering physiological epithelial responses to microbiota to maintain mucosal health."
Immunology,Cardiolipin Inhibits the Noncanonical Inflammasome by Preventing LPS Binding to Caspase 4/11 to Mitigate Endotoxemia in Vivo,"Malvina,Mercedes,Sabrina Sofia,Jakub,Melan,Jing Rong,Emmanuelle,Joanna,Monalisa,Kirsten M.,Jared R.,Masahiro,Si Ming,Petr,Pablo,Kate,Malvina,Mercedes,Sabrina Sofia,Jakub,Melan,Jing Rong,Emmanuelle,Joanna,Monalisa,Kirsten M.,Jared R.,Masahiro,Si Ming,Petr,Pablo,Kate,Malvina,Mercedes,Sabrina Sofia,Jakub,Melan,Jing Rong,Emmanuelle,Joanna,Monalisa,Kirsten M.,Jared R.,Masahiro,Si Ming,Petr,Pablo","In Gram-negative bacterial sepsis, excessive caspase 4/11 activation in response to circulating bacterial lipid LPS (endotoxemia) can cause organ damage and mortality. Current inhibitors of caspase 4/11 also block caspase 1 activity and are therefore not appealing clinical candidates for treating Gram-negative sepsis. Here, we identify double-unsaturated 18:2 cardiolipin as a selective inhibitor of caspase 4/11-dependent inflammatory cytokine secretion and pyroptosis, without affecting caspase-1 responses. Cardiolipin targets the CARD domain of caspase 4/11, impeding its interaction with LPS to restrain caspase 4/11 activation, thereby suppressing endotoxemia-induced systemic inflammation in vivo. Thus, we present cardiolipin as a promising candidate for preventing endotoxemia-induced sequelae in sepsis while preserving caspase-1-driven anti-microbial immune responses. By identifying cardiolipin as a specific caspase 4/11 inhibitor, we provide an urgently-needed tool for studying caspase 4/11 functions in inflammatory pathways, and open the way to studies of noncanonical inflammasome regulation by endogenous cardiolipin."

Here we identify two independently active tripeptide pharmacophores within PEPITEM and engineered peptidomimetics with enhanced pharmacodynamic properties. These peptidomimetics regulate T-cell trafficking in vitro and reduce T-cell, neutrophil and macrophage numbers in the inflamed peritoneal cavity in vivo. In a plaque psoriasis model, topical administration reduced disease severity, inflammation and immune cell infiltration, while regulating cytokine release in macrophages and fibroblasts, as well as keratinocyte proliferation. Th1 and Th17 cell abundance, along with their cytokines, was reduced in secondary lymphoid organs. This expanded functional repertoire of PEPITEM and its derivatives provides innovative tools for countering immune and stromal cell-induced pathology in IMIDs, paving the way for a novel class of anti-inflammatory agents."
Bioengineering,Development and Validation of a Comprehensive Tumor Treating Fields System for Glioblastoma Therapy: From Prototype Design to Preclinical Evaluation,"Xindong,Han,Zhiyong,Xian,Xindong,Han,Zhiyong,Xian,Xindong,Han,Zhiyong","Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Tumor Treating Fields (TTF) therapy, which uses alternating electric fields to disrupt cancer cell division, has emerged as a promising non-invasive treatment. However, the development and optimization of TTF systems remain challenging, with limited studies detailing the design and practical application of such systems. In this study, we developed a novel TTF prototype, focusing on the design and fabrication of key components such as the electrical signal regulation, transmission and corresponding therapeutic effects. We evaluated the system’s efficacy through a series of , and , experiments. ,, we demonstrated significant inhibition of GBM cell proliferation under varying electric field intensities, with stronger fields showing greater efficacy. , studies using a rat glioblastoma model revealed reduced tumor growth, increased apoptosis, and enhanced immune infiltration in the TTF-treated group compared to controls. This comprehensive study provides a valuable reference for TTF system development, offering insights into both the technical design and biological application of TTF therapy, and highlighting its potential for improving GBM treatment outcomes."
Bioengineering,Mimicking mechanics: A comparison of meat and meat analogs,"Skyler R.,Ellen,Skyler R.,Ellen,Skyler R.","The texture of meat is one of the most important features to mimic when developing meat analogs. Both protein source and processing method impact the texture of the final product. We can distinguish three types of mechanical tests to quantify the textural differences between meat and meat analogs: puncture-type, rheological torsion tests, and classical mechanical tests of tension, compression, and bending. Here we compile the shear force and stiffness values of whole and comminuted meats and meat analogs from the two most popular tests for meat, the Warner-Bratzler shear test and the double-compression texture profile analysis. Our results suggest that, with the right fine-tuning, today's meat analogs are well capable of mimicking the mechanics of real meat. While Warner-Bratzler shear tests and texture profile analysis provide valuable information about the tenderness and sensory perception of meat, both tests suffer from a lack of standardization, which limits cross-study comparisons. Here we provide guidelines to standardize meat testing and report the meat stiffness as the single most informative mechanical parameter. Collecting big standardized data and sharing them with the community at large could empower researchers to harness the power of generative artificial intelligence to inform the systematic development of meat analogs with desired mechanical properties and functions, taste and sensory perception."
Bioengineering,Stress-free Bioprinting of Human Primary and iPSC-derived Islets with Retained Functionality,"Miranda,Ravikumar,Connor,Ben,Ruiqi,Rodrigo M.,Zhenghao,Alejandro,Prashant N.,Ipsita,Miranda,Ravikumar,Connor,Ben,Ruiqi,Rodrigo M.,Zhenghao,Alejandro,Prashant N.,Ipsita,Miranda,Ravikumar,Connor,Ben,Ruiqi,Rodrigo M.,Zhenghao,Alejandro,Prashant N.","Currently, Type 1 diabetes (T1D) can be treated through implantation of allogenic islets, which replenish the beta cell population, however this method requires an extensive post-implantation immunosuppressant regimen. Personalized cellular therapy can address this through implantation of an autologous cell population, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Cellular therapy, however, requires an encapsulation device for implantation, and so to achieve this uniformly with cells in a clinical setting, bioprinting is required. Bioprinting is dependent on having a bioink that is printable, retains structural fidelity after printing, and is supportive of cell type and function. The objective of this study was to design and develop bioinks that were compatible with printing islets. Here, we detail the successful bioprinting of both primary human islets and iPSC-derived islets embedded in an alginate/methylcellulose bioink, with functionality sustained within the construct for both cell lineages. Sc-RNAseq analysis also revealed that printing did not adversely affect the genetic expression and metabolic functionality of the iPSC-derived islets. Importantly, the iPSC-derived islets displayed comparable functionality to the primary islets, indicating the potential to act as a cell source alternative for T1D implantation."

Protein amplification assays like real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) are sensitive yet currently limited to semi-invasive sample types such as cerebrospinal fluid because more accessible samples, such as blood, contain inhibitors. Here, we show that Nanoparticle-enhanced Quaking-induced Conversion (Nano-QuIC) can double the speed of reactions spiked with misfolded α-synuclein while increasing sensitivity 100-fold in human plasma. Nano-QuIC detected spike concentrations down to 90 pg/ml in lysed whole blood, while reactions without nanoparticles (RT-QuIC) failed to have any detection due to the presence of strong inhibitors. Moreover, Nano-QuIC showed increased seeding activity in plasma samples from Parkinson disease patients (n=4) versus healthy controls (n=4). This sets the groundwork for the noninvasive diagnostic use of Nano-QuIC, potentially enabling early disease detection and management through blood-based testing."
Biochemistry,How the microbiome liberates iron from heme,"Arnab Kumar,Ronivaldo Rodrigues,Emmanuel,Victoria,Mensur,C. Martin,Jennifer,Arnab Kumar,Ronivaldo Rodrigues,Emmanuel,Victoria,Mensur,C. Martin,Jennifer,Arnab Kumar,Ronivaldo Rodrigues,Emmanuel,Victoria,Mensur,C. Martin","The microbiome is a hidden organ system with diverse metabolic roles. Using Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B theta) as a model, we asked how microbiome species process iron, the quintessential biometal supporting respiration and life as we know it, when iron is provided in complex with protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) as heme. Canonical pathways for reclaiming heme-iron from host cells or the diet require O2, which is unavailable in the GI tract and many pathological microenvironments. HmuS, a homolog of cobalamine- (vitamin B12) and chlorophyll-building chelatases, is widespread in anaerobic microbial ecosystems. In this work, we provide direct physiological, biochemical, and structural evidence for the anaerobic removal of iron from heme by HmuS, a de-chelatase that deconstructs heme to PPIX and Fe(II). We show that heme can be used as a sole iron source by B theta, yielding PPIX, and that hmuS inactivation under these conditions is lethal. Iron removal from heme depends on the B theta membrane fraction, NADH, and O2 exclusion. Absorbance spectra indicate that heterologously expressed HmuS is isolated with a non-substrate heme bound and can accommodate multiple heme equivalents under saturating conditions. Solution of the cryoEM structure reveals heme and two cations at sites that are conserved across the HmuS family and the chelatase superfamily, respectively. The proposed structure-based mechanism for iron removal further links biosynthetic and biodegradative pathways for heme, chlorophyll, and vitamin B12, 3 ancient and biologically crucial metallocofactors."

Atrial myopathy, including fibrosis, is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, but the mechanisms underlying this association are poorly understood. Fibrosis modifies myocardial structure, impairing electrical propagation and tissue biomechanics, and creating stagnant flow regions where clots could form. Fibrosis can be mapped non-invasively using late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI). However, fibrosis maps are not currently incorporated into stroke risk calculations or computational electro-mechano-fluidic models. We present multi-physics simulations of left atrial (LA) myocardial motion and hemodynamics using patient-specific anatomies and fibrotic maps from LGE-MRI. We modify tissue stiffness and active tension generation in fibrotic regions and investigate how these changes affect LA flow for different fibrotic burdens. We find that fibrotic regions and, to a lesser extent, non-fibrotic regions experience reduced myocardial strain, resulting in decreased LA emptying fraction consistent with clinical observations. Both fibrotic tissue stiffening and hypocontractility independently reduce LA function, but together, these two alterations cause more pronounced effects than either one alone. Fibrosis significantly alters flow patterns throughout the atrial chamber, and particularly, the filling and emptying jets of the left atrial appendage (LAA). The effects of fibrosis in LA flow are largely captured by the concomitant changes in LA emptying fraction except inside the LAA, where a multi-factorial behavior is observed. This work illustrates how high-fidelity, multi-physics models can be used to study thrombogenesis mechanisms in patient-specific anatomies, shedding light onto the links between atrial fibrosis and ischemic stroke."
Biochemistry,A new class of receptors: Lipids regulate mammalian Gsα-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities via their membrane anchors,"Marius,Sherif,Harald,Adrian C. D.,Anita,Joachim E,Marius,Sherif,Harald,Adrian C. D.,Anita,Joachim E,Marius,Sherif,Harald,Adrian C. D.,Anita","The biosynthesis of cAMP by mammalian membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases (mACs) is predominantly regulated by G-protein-coupled-receptors (GPCRs). Up to now the two hexahelical transmembrane domains of mACs were considered to fix the enzyme to membranes. Here we show that the transmembrane domains serve in addition as signal receptors and transmitters of lipid signals that control Gsalpha-stimulated mAC activities. We identify aliphatic fatty acids and anandamide as receptor ligands of mAC isoforms 1 to 7 and 9. The ligands enhance (mAC isoforms 2, 3, 7, and 9) or attenuate (isoforms 1, 4, 5, and 6) Gsalpha-stimulated mAC activities in vitro and in vivo. Substitution of the stimulatory membrane receptor of mAC3 by the inhibitory receptor of mAC5 results in a ligand inhibited mAC5-mAC3 chimera. Thus, we discovered a new class of membrane receptors in which two signaling modalities are at a crossing, direct tonic lipid and indirect phasic GPCR-Gsalpha signaling regulating the biosynthesis of cAMP."

Clinical trials with ""first generation"" bnAbs used alone or in combination show promising antiviral effects but also highlight that additional engineering of ""enhanced"" antibodies will be required for optimal clinical utility, while preserving or enhancing cGMP manufacturing capability. Here we report the engineering of an anti-CD4 binding-site (CD4bs) bnAb, N49P9.3, purified from the plasma of an HIV elite-neutralizer. Through a series of rational modifications we produced a variant that demonstrates: enhanced potency; superior antiviral activity in combination with other bnAbs; low polyreactivity; and longer circulating half-life. Additional engineering for manufacturing produced a final variant, eN49P9, with properties conducive to cGMP production. Overall, these efforts demonstrate the feasibility of developing enhanced anti-CD4bs bnAbs with greatly improved antiviral properties as well as potential translational value."
Biochemistry,A human high-fidelity DNA polymerase holoenzyme has a wide range of lesion bypass activities,"Rachel L,Joseph A,Helen,Shijun,Marc M,Mark,Rachel L,Joseph A,Helen,Shijun,Marc M,Mark,Rachel L,Joseph A,Helen,Shijun,Marc M","During replication, lagging strand lesions are initially encountered by high fidelity DNA polymerase (pol) holoenzymes comprised of pol δ and the PCNA sliding clamp. To proceed unhindered, pol δ holoenzymes must bypass lesions without stalling. This entails dNMP incorporation opposite the lesion (insertion) and the 5' template nucleotide (extension). Historically, it was viewed that high-fidelity pol holoenzymes stall upon encountering lesions, activating DNA damage tolerance pathways that are ultimately responsible for lesion bypass. Our recent study of 4 prominent lesions revealed that human pol δ holoenzymes support insertion and/or bypass for multiple lesions and the extents of these activities depends on the lesion and pol δ proofreading. In the present study, we expand these analyses to other prominent lesions. Collectively, analyses of 10 lesions from both studies reveal that the insertion and bypass efficiencies of pol δ holoenzymes each span a complete range (0 to 100%). Consequently, the fates of pol δ holoenzymes upon encountering lesions are quite diverse. Furthermore, pol δ proofreading promoted holoenzyme progression at 7 of the 10 lesions and did not deter progression at any. Altogether, the results significantly alter our understanding of the replicative capacity of high fidelity pol holoenzymes and their functional role(s) in lesion bypass."

A profound understanding of the ligand selectivity, binding mode, and influential factors governing ligand engagement with RNA targets is the foundation for rational ligand design. Here, we report a novel class of coumarin derivatives exhibiting selective binding affinity towards single G RNA bulges. Harnessing the computational power of all-atom Gaussian accelerated Molecular Dynamics (GaMD) simulations, we unveiled a rare minor groove binding mode of the ligand with a key interaction between the coumarin moiety and the G bulge. This predicted binding mode is consistent with results obtained from structure-activity-relationship (SAR) studies and transverse relaxation measurements by NMR spectroscopy. We further generated 444 molecular descriptors from 69 coumarin derivatives and identified key contributors to the binding events, such as charge state and planarity, by lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression. Strikingly, small structure perturbations on these key contributors, such as the addition of a methyl group that disrupts the planarity of the ligand resulted in > 100-fold reduction in the binding affinity. Our work deepened the understanding of RNA-small molecule interactions and integrated a new generalizable platform for the rational design of selective small-molecule RNA binders."
Biochemistry,Sequential structure probing of cotranscriptional RNA folding intermediates,"Courtney E.,Skyler L.,Eric J.,Courtney E.,Skyler L.,Eric J.,Courtney E.,Skyler L.","Cotranscriptional RNA folding pathways typically involve the sequential formation of folding intermediates. Existing methods for cotranscriptional RNA structure probing map the structure of nascent RNA in the context of a terminally arrested transcription elongation complex. Consequently, the rearrangement of RNA structures as nucleotides are added to the transcript can be inferred but is not assessed directly. To address this limitation, we have developed linked-multipoint Transcription Elongation Complex RNA structure probing (TECprobe-LM), which assesses the cotranscriptional rearrangement of RNA structures by sequentially positioning , RNAP at two or more points within a DNA template so that nascent RNA can be chemically probed. We validated TECprobe-LM by measuring known folding events that occur within the , signal recognition particle RNA, , ZTP riboswitch, and , fluoride riboswitch folding pathways. Our findings establish TECprobe-LM as a strategy for detecting cotranscriptional RNA folding events directly using chemical probing."

They exhibit many and diverse functions, such as but not limited to, growth factor signaling, immune and inflammatory response, protein quality control, and parasitic invasion. Human rhomboid protease RHBDL4 has been demonstrated to play a critical role in removing misfolded proteins from the Endoplasmic Reticulum and is implicated in severe diseases such as various cancers and Alzheimers disease. Therefore, RHBDL4 is expected to constitute an important therapeutic target for such devastating diseases. Despite its critical role in many biological processes, the enzymatic properties of RHBDL4 remain largely unknown. To enable a comprehensive characterization of RHBDL4s kinetics, catalytic parameters, substrate specificity, and binding modality we expressed and purified recombinant RHBDL4, and employed it in a Forster Resonance Energy Transfer-based cleavage assay. Until now, kinetic studies have been limited mostly to bacterial rhomboid proteases. Our in vitro platform offers a new method for studying RHBDL4s enzymatic function and substrate preferences. Furthermore, we developed and tested potential inhibitors using our assay and successfully identifying peptidyl α-ketoamide inhibitors of RHBDL4 that are highly effective against recombinant RHBDL4.  We utilize ensemble docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the binding modality of substrate-derived peptides bound to RHBDL4. Our analysis focused on key interactions and dynamic movements within RHBDL4s active site that contributed to binding stability, offering valuable insights for optimizing the non-prime side of RHBDL4 ketoamide inhibitors. In summary, our study offers fundamental insights into RHBDL4s catalytic activities and substrate preferences, laying the foundation for downstream applications such as drug inhibitor screenings and structure-function studies, which will enable the identification of lead drug compounds for RHBDL4."

Hyperandrogenism and chronic inflammation are hallmarks of PCOS, which is diagnosed by analysing steroid hormones in the blood. Studies suggest that bioactive lipids are contributing to chronic inflammation. To research PCOS, animal models, such as letrozole- and dihydrotestosterone-treated rats, are used. They display similar ovarian and metabolic characteristics, although plasma lipid profiles have not been determined. Therefore, in order to validate the use of these models for PCOS, we have optimised a mass spectrometry based targeted lipidomics workflow which increases the sensitivity of measuring these lipids in rat plasma. Our analysis shows that letrozole caused a significant elevation of 5α-androstene-3,17-dione and testosterone. Dihydrotestosterone treatment resulted in increased dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate and allopregnanolone but a reduction in testosterone, progesterone, pregnenolone, and D-sphingosine. In both models 25-hydroxycholesterol and leukotriene C4 were significantly diminished and 4-cholesten-3-one was significantly increased, and these particular metabolites are not known to be changed in human PCOS. These results suggest that the plasma lipids of these rodent models have some changes akin to human PCOS and other changes that are not."

Release of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland into the bloodstream and their transport into target cells is facilitated by plasma membrane transporters, of which monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)8 and the highly homologous MCT10 are most important. Patients with MCT8 mutations suffer from a severe neurodevelopmental and metabolic disorder, however, the molecular mechanism underlying thyroid hormone transport is unknown. Using cryogenic-sample electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined the ligand-free and thyroxine-bound human MCT8 structures in the outward-open state and the thyroxine-bound human MCT10 in the inward-facing state. Our structural analysis revealed a network of conserved gate residues involved in conformational changes upon thyroxine binding, triggering ligand release on the opposite compartment. We then determined the structure of a folded, but inactive patient-derived MCT8 mutant, indicating a subtle conformational change which explains its reduced transport activity. In addition, we determined the structure of MCT8 bound to its inhibitor silychristin, revealing an interaction with residues essential to drive transition to the inward-facing state, thereby locking the protein in the outward-facing state. This study provides molecular and structural insights into normal and disordered thyroid hormone transport."
Pharmacology and Toxicology,Proximal Tubule-on-Chip for Predicting Cation Transport: Dynamic Insights into Drug Transporter Expression and Function,"Isy,Quentin,Jean-Sebastien,Perrine,Antoine,François-Ludovic,Pierre,Nicolas,Florent,Isy,Quentin,Jean-Sebastien,Perrine,Antoine,François-Ludovic,Pierre,Nicolas,Florent,Isy,Quentin,Jean-Sebastien,Perrine,Antoine,François-Ludovic,Pierre,Nicolas","Deciphering the sources of variability in drug responses requires to understand the processes modulating drug pharmacokinetics. However, pharmacological research suffers from poor reproducibility across clinical, animal, and experimental models. Predictivity can be improved by using Organs-on-Chips, which are more physiological, human-oriented, micro-engineered devices that include microfluidics. OoC are particularly relevant at the fundamental and preclinical stages of drug development by providing more accurate assessment of key pharmacokinetic events. We have developed a proximal tubule-on-a-chip model combining commercial microfluidic and chip technologies. Using the RPTEC/TERT1 cell line, we set up a dual-flow system with antiparallel flows to mimic the dynamics of blood and urine. We assessed transporters mRNA expression using RT-qPCR, cellular polarization and protein expression via immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, and monitored the transcellular transport of a list of prototypic xenobiotics by determining their efflux ratios with LC-MS/MS. Our results show that flow exposure significantly modulate mRNA expression of drug membrane transporters compared to static conditions. Dynamic conditions also enhance cell polarization, as evidenced by preferential basal and apical expressions of Na+/K+-ATPase, P-gp, OCT2, and MATE1 , as well as the cellular secretory profile. We demonstrated unidirectional transcellular transport of a cationic substrate (metformin) with a higher efflux than influx ratio, inhibited with a specific OCT2 inhibitor, thus confirming the relevance of our proximal tubule-on-a-chip set up for cation transport investigations. Our proximal tubule-on-a-chip can also be used to explore the interactions between transporters, xenobiotics, and endogenous metabolites, possibly involved in the variability of individual drug responses. This study provides additional evidence that OoC can bridge the gaps between systemic and local pharmacokinetics, i.e., drug concentration close to its target, at the fundamental and preclinical stages."
Pharmacology and Toxicology,Multi-behavioral phenotyping in zebrafish identifies a novel disruptor of non-associative learning with environmental and human relevance,"David,Nadia Katherine,Jana,Kristina,Ilka,Stefan Jens,Nicole,Ellen,Tamara,David,Nadia Katherine,Jana,Kristina,Ilka,Stefan Jens,Nicole,Ellen,Tamara,David,Nadia Katherine,Jana,Kristina,Ilka,Stefan Jens,Nicole,Ellen","The vertebrate nervous system is vulnerable to chemical toxicity and the widespread release of chemicals into the environment outstrips the capacity to assess their safety. We devised a battery of automated behavior assays in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio), a 3R-compliant model amenable to higher-throughput chemical screens. The battery captures stereotypical visual and acoustic behaviors including habituation, a form of non-associative learning. Known pharmacological modulators of habituation in zebrafish evoked distinct behavioral patterns. By screening chemicals positive for ex vivo N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) modulation, we identified chlorophene, a biocide that caused sedation, paradoxical excitation, and reduced habituation in zebrafish. Using in silico target predictions and pharmacological interventions, we discovered that chlorophene acts via gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors (GABAARs), a previously unknown target site. Orthogonal validation in cultured mouse cortical neurons and human stem cell-derived BrainSpheres confirmed chlorophene's interaction with GABAARs. Together, multi-behavioral phenotyping in zebrafish can accelerate the identification of neurotoxicants and their underlying mode of action."
Pharmacology and Toxicology,PPARalpha-ERRalpha crosstalk mitigates metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease progression,"Milton Boaheng,Sander,Dorien,Lisa,Anneleen,Louis,Kylian,Daria,Jonathan,Madeleine,Anne,Anja,Lindsey,Karolien,Milton Boaheng,Sander,Dorien,Lisa,Anneleen,Louis,Kylian,Daria,Jonathan,Madeleine,Anne,Anja,Lindsey,Karolien,Milton Boaheng,Sander,Dorien,Lisa,Anneleen,Louis,Kylian,Daria,Jonathan,Madeleine,Anne,Anja,Lindsey","Background and aims
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is now the most common liver disease worldwide. This study investigates how targeting two key nuclear receptors involved in hepatic energy metabolism, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha), impacts MASLD.
Methods
The PPARalpha agonist pemafibrate and/or ERRalpha inverse agonist C29 were administered in a short- and long-term Western diet plus fructose model, and a diabetic-background streptozotocin-Western diet model (STZ-WD). Liver morphology, histological samples, serum metabolites, RNA and protein levels were analysed and scanning electron microscopy was performed. In addition, we performed cell-based assays and immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence stainings with light and super-resolution confocal microscopy of healthy, MASLD and MASH human livers.
Results
The ligand combination efficacy was underscored by reduced liver steatosis in all the mouse models. Both long-term models showed improvements in body weight and liver morphology, alongside reductions in inflammation and fibrosis. Additionally, tumor formation was prevented in the STZ-WD mice model. Cell-based assays demonstrated that ERRalpha inhibits PPARalpha activity, likely explaining why ERRalpha blockage improves inflammatory and lipid metabolism gene profiles and enhances lipid-lowering effects. Complementary RNA sequencing and shotgun proteomics, combined with enrichment analysis, jointly identified downregulated serum amyloid A1/A2 as an essential component underlying the combination treatment's effectiveness. MASLD/MASH patient livers showed reduced PPARalpha and increased ERRalpha levels supporting disrupted NR crosstalk in the hepatocyte nucleus.
Conclusion
Our study comprehensively supports that dual nuclear receptor targeting by simultaneously increasing PPARalpha and diminishing ERRalpha activity may represent a viable novel strategy against MASLD."
Pharmacology and Toxicology,Role of CCK1 receptor in metabolic benefits of intestinal enteropeptidase inhibition in mice,"Simon  Amadeus,Kamal,Cassandre,Jianying,Stephen,Neetu,Rong,George,Raul  C.,James,Andrea  R.,Simon  Amadeus,Kamal,Cassandre,Jianying,Stephen,Neetu,Rong,George,Raul  C.,James,Andrea  R.,Simon  Amadeus,Kamal,Cassandre,Jianying,Stephen,Neetu,Rong,George,Raul  C.,James","Enteropeptidase (EP; enterokinase) is a serine protease that regulates intestinal protein digestion by converting trypsinogen into active trypsin, and thus initiates activation of the pancreatic zymogen cascade. Chronic inhibition of EP and trypsin (EP/T) with camostat (Foipan, FOY-305) or its active metabolite (FOY-251) causes weight loss in obese mice by reducing intestinal protein absorption and suppression of food intake, however, the mechanisms leading to appetite suppression are not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that cholecystokinin (CCK) signaling mediates the anorectic effects of EP/T inhibition using a CCK1R inhibitor (loxiglumide) or CCK1R knockout (KO) mice. Acute treatment with loxiglumide was able to partially reverse FOY-251-induced gallbladder contraction and delayed gastric emptying in mice. Chronic co-administration of loxiglumide reversed FOY-251 mediated effects on food intake and metabolism in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Chronic dosing of FOY-251 caused similar reductions in food intake but greater weight loss in CCK1R KO mice compared to wildtype (WT) mice, primarily due to fat mass loss. Pair fed (PF) groups revealed food intake-dependent and -independent mechanisms of weight loss by FOY-251. Notably, FOY-251 treatment induced sustained weight loss, whereas body weight loss rebounded in PF animals. In CCKR1 KO mice, FOY-251 caused greater weight loss, and increased protein calorie loss relative to that in WT mice, while having no effect on glycemic control or FGF21. Hence, CCK1R-dependent and -independent mechanisms modulate the metabolic effects of EP/T inhibition and may play a role in maintaining weight loss by this mechanism."
Pharmacology and Toxicology,"Alcohol induces p53-mediated apoptosis in neural crest by stimulating the AMPK-mediated suppression of TORC1, p70/S6K, and ribosomal biogenesis.","Yanping,George R,Susan M,Yanping,George R,Susan M,Yanping,George R","Background. Prenatal alcohol exposure is a leading cause of permanent neurodevelopmental disability. Diagnosis is often initiated by a distinctive craniofacial appearance that originates, in part, from the apoptotic deletion of craniofacial progenitors, a stem cell lineage called the neural crest (NC). We recently demonstrated that alcohol causes nucleolar stress in NC through its suppression of Ribosome Biogenesis (RBG) and this suppression is causative in their p53/MDM2-mediated apoptosis. Here, we show that this nucleolar stress originates from alcohol's activation of AMPK, which suppresses TORC1 and the p70/S6K-mediated stimulation of RBG. Methods. Alcohol-exposed cells of the pluripotent, primary cranial NC line O9-1 were evaluated with respect to their p70/S6K, TORC1, and AMPK activity. The functional impact of these signals with respect to RBG, p53, and apoptosis were assessed using gain-of-function constructs and small molecule mediators. Results. Alcohol rapidly (<2hr) increased pAMPK, p-Raptor, and reduced both total and p-p70/S6K in NC cells. These changes persisted for at least 12hr to 18hr following alcohol exposure. Attenuation of these signals via gain- or loss-of-function approaches prevented alcohol's suppression of rRNA synthesis and the induction of p53-stimulated apoptosis. Conclusions. We conclude that alcohol induces ribosome dysbiogenesis and activates their p53/MDM2-mediated apoptosis via its activation of pAMPK, which in turn activates Raptor to suppress the TORC1/S6K-mediated promotion of ribosome biogenesis. This represents a novel mechanism underlying alcohol's neurotoxicity and is consistent with findings that TORC1/S6K networks are critical for cranial NC survival."

A substantial strategy to combat AMR and ensure safe and efficient antimicrobial therapies in the future is the development of antimicrobial agents based on novel scaffolds exerting an innovative mode of action. The antibacterial class of cystobactamids, natural products targeting the bacterial gyrase and topoisomerase IV, have such a novel scaffold, and their synthetic derivatives exhibit broad-spectrum antibiotic activity. Herein, as part of our de-risking strategy, we set out to study and characterize potential biological effects on eukaryotic cells. A comprehensive toxicological in vitro profiling focusing on general cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and mitochondrial toxicity is provided along with in vivo experiments to characterize potential developmental, cardio- and hepatotoxicity in zebrafish embryos. Results from these investigations support good safety and a presumably high therapeutic index of cystobactamids, even suggesting potential protective properties against oxidative cell stress. Furthermore, in vitro metabolism studies unveiled glucuronidation and amide bond hydrolysis as the main pathways of biotransformation in hepatocytes. Metabolic stability of cystobactamids was substantially improved by co-treatment with the CYP3A/OATP1B inhibitor cobicistat. In addition, eukaryotic off-targets of cystobactamids were studied on the molecular level employing affinity-based protein profiling and revealing scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SCARB1) as primary eukaryotic target protein. Indeed, functional inhibition of SCARB1 by cystobactamids was shown and effectively prevented hepatitis C virus pseudoparticles (HCVpp) from cell entry, thus confirming SCARB1 inhibition as novel target of the class."

Trastuzumab, HER2-targeting monoclonal antibody drug, has shown considerable clinical success, however, readily emerging drug resistance emphasizes the pressing need for improved interventions in HER2-overexpressing cancers. To address this, we proposed targeting the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between ELF3 and MED23 as an alternative therapeutic approach to trastuzumab. In this study, we synthesized a total of 26 compounds consisting of 10 chalcones, 7 pyrazoline acetyl, and 9 pyrazoline propionyl derivatives, and evaluated their biological activity as potential ELF3-MED23 PPI inhibitors. Upon systematic analysis, candidate compound 10 was selected due to its potency in downregulating reporter gene activity of HER2 promoter confirmed by SEAP activity and its effect on HER2 protein and mRNA levels. Compound 10 effectively disrupted the binding interface between the ELF3 TAD domain and the 391-582 amino acid region of MED23, resulting in successful inhibition of the ELF3-MED23 PPI. This intervention led to a substantial reduction in HER2 levels and its downstream signals in the HER2-positive gastric cancer cell line. Subsequently, compound 10 induced significant apoptosis and anti-proliferative effects, demonstrating superior in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity overall. We found that the anticancer activity of compound 10 was not only restricted to trastuzumab-sensitive cases, but was also valid for trastuzumab-refractory clones. This suggests its potential as a viable therapeutic option for trastuzumab-resistant gastric cancers. In summary, compound 10 could be a novel alternative therapeutic strategy for HER2-overexpressing cancers, overcoming the limitations of trastuzumab."

Here we applied mass spectrometry-based proteomics to assess the effects of 46 approved or retracted drugs with various levels of concerns for drug-induced liver injury and annotated for mitochondrial mechanisms, along with 8 tool compounds, on the secretome of a hepatocyte liver model. We observed distinct clusters of non-canonical secretion, and intracellular thermal proteome profiling linked dysregulated mechanisms to extracellular markers. Functional follow-up confirmed lysosomal alterations by cationic-amphiphilic drugs, connected damage of the respiratory chain to Rab7-dependent secretion of mitochondrial proteins, and linked drug-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress to reduced basal secretion. Perturbation of sphingolipid biosynthesis pathways specifically induced secretion of the cargo sorting protein SDF4 whilst suppressing secretion of its cargo proteins. Thermal stability changes of clusters of membrane proteins in distinct subcellular compartments suggest local accumulation as important driver for unexpected drug effects through direct and indirect interactions."
Pharmacology and Toxicology,Predicting uptake and elimination kinetics of chemicals in invertebrates: a technical note on residual variance modeling,"Henk J.,Edoardo,Maria,Marta,Nico W.,Henk J.,Edoardo,Maria,Marta,Nico W.,Henk J.,Edoardo,Maria,Marta","Toxicokinetic models for predicting contents of nanomaterials and other toxic chemicals are often fitted without evaluation of the residual variance structure. The aim of the present study was to evaluate various residual variance structures, assuming either homoscedasticity or heteroscedasticity, when fitting non-linear toxicokinetic one-compartment models for predicting uptake, bioaccumulation and elimination of chemicals in invertebrate organisms. Data describing the exposure of several aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates to specific metal nanomaterials and other chemicals were available from real experiments for evaluating the residual variance functions for toxicokinetic models. As proof of concept, datasets of truly homoscedastic and heteroscedastic nature were simulated. Depending the dataset, applying models with different residuals variance assumption largely affected the residual plots and the error margins of parameters or the predicted content of a chemical. Consequently, selecting the most accurate residual variance functions for toxicokinetic modeling, either homoscedastic or heteroscedastic, improves the prediction of chemical contents in invertebrate organisms and the estimation of the associated uptake and elimination rates."
Pharmacology and Toxicology,Attentive graph neural network models for the prediction of blood-brain barrier permeability,"Jesse W.,Mahmoud,Daniel,Mostafa,Laurence,Bridget M.,Brandon,Jennifer O.,Jesse W.,Mahmoud,Daniel,Mostafa,Laurence,Bridget M.,Brandon,Jennifer O.,Jesse W.,Mahmoud,Daniel,Mostafa,Laurence,Bridget M.,Brandon","The blood-brain barrier (BBB) has unique endothelial cells and tight junctions that selectively regulate passage of molecules to the central nervous system (CNS) to prevent pathogen entry and maintain neural homeostasis. Various neurological conditions and neurodegenerative diseases benefit from small molecules capable of BBB penetration (BBBP) to elicit a therapeutic effect. Predicting BBBP often involves in silico assessment of molecular properties such as lipophilicity (logP) and polar surface area (PSA) using the CNS multiparameter optimization (MPO) method. This study curated an open-source dataset to rigorously benchmark machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) models with each other and with MPO for predicting BBBP. Our analysis demonstrated that AI models, especially attentive NNs using stereochemical features, significantly outperform MPO in predicting BBBP. An attentive graph neural network (GNN), which we refer to as CANDID-CNS, achieved a 0.23-0.26 higher AUROC score than MPO on full test sets, and a 0.17-0.19 higher score on stereoisomers filtered subsets. Regarding stereoisomers that differ in BBBP, which MPO cannot distinguish, CANDID-CNS correctly classifies these with AURPC, AUROC, and MCC metrics comparable to or better than those of MPO on less difficult test molecules. These findings suggest that integrating attentive GNN models such as CANDID-CNS into pharmaceutical drug discovery processes can substantially improve prediction rates, and thereby reduce the timeline, cost, and increase the probability of success of designing brain penetrant therapeutics for the treatment of a wide variety of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases."
Systems Biology,Spillover rate is not predictive of host jump risk,"Brandon J,David A,Brandon J,David A,Brandon J","Spillover of infectious diseases is a significant issue for human, animal, and plant health, in part due to their potential to host jump. Current approaches to predict and prevent host jumps are structured around discovering new viruses, drawing associations between pathogen characteristics and host jump risk, and managing spillover, but prediction and prevention are still elusive. Spillover is a critical step in the process of completing a host jump, so it is often assumed that a pathogen's spillover rate is predictive of host jump risk. However, this may not necessarily be the case.  While a pathogen that spills over into a novel host frequently will indeed have many opportunities to establish itself, the lack of success establishing itself in previous spillovers demonstrates a poor ability to do so. In comparison, a pathogen that rarely spills over will have few opportunities to establish itself, but may be well suited to do so, and could, in theory, be more likely to host jump despite these limited opportunities. Here we address the question of which of these poses the greater risk. Using a Bayesian framework, we create a model to quantify the probability that a host jump occurs in some future time interval. This model only depends on the number of spillover events in the past and future, and our uncertainty regarding the probability that a single spillover will result in a host jump. We derive an analytical solution to this model, which shows that when past and future spillover rates are linearly correlated, a pathogen's inherent rate of spillover is a poor predictor of host jump risk owing to two complementary factors. First, the pathogens that pose the greatest host jump risk may be either those that spillover extremely rarely or extremely commonly, with the result depending on our prior uncertainly in the probability that a spillover will result in a host jump. Second, as spillover rate becomes large, the increase in the number of opportunities for a host jump to occur conferred by the increase in the number of spillover events is exactly balanced by a decrease in the probability of success for each individual spillover event. Therefore, we show that spillover rate is not a useful metric for evaluating host jump risk."
Systems Biology,Parameter Dependence in Identifiability Applied to FP-Fisher-KPP Reaction-Diffusion Equations Parameterized for Tauopathy Network Modeling,"Arsalan,Habib,Arsalan,Habib,Arsalan","Parameterization and a priori identifiability analysis are two interconnected steps that should be carried out in advance of model calibration. In the first place, we propose a framework for parameterizing a recently introduced and analytically studied generalization of the celebrated Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (Fisher-KPP) reaction-diffusion (Re-Di) equation with fractional polynomial (FP) terms to model heterogeneous nonlinear diffusion in the propagation of a given species through directed networks, exemplified by the tauopathy progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Next, we present our results on identifiability in a generic sense for multi-experimental designs, applicable to analytic and meromorphic systems, including the suggested parameterized FP-Fisher-KPP Re-Di equations. In particular, the concept of generic local minimal dependence of unknown parameters and parameterized initial conditions will be formalized using one-parameter Lie groups of transformations, and a decomposition method to explore this new concept will be devised. Finally, the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (AMBCA) dataset is utilized to develop a model for tauopathy progression in the mouse brain, which will subsequently be employed to implement the proposed methodology for analyzing a priori identifiability."

Protein abundance, turnover, and post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, are key factors that determine tissue-specific proteome properties. However, these properties are challenging to study across tissues and remain poorly understood. Here, we present Turnover-PPT, a comprehensive resource mapping the abundance and lifetime of 11,000 proteins and 40,000 phosphosites across eight mouse tissues and various brain regions, using advanced proteomics and stable isotope labeling. We revealed tissue-specific short- and long-lived proteins, strong correlations between interacting protein lifetimes, and distinct impacts of phosphorylation on protein turnover. Notably, we discovered that peroxisomes are regulated by protein turnover across tissues, and that phosphorylation regulates the stability of neurodegeneration-related proteins, such as Tau and α-synuclein. Thus, Turnover-PPT provides new fundamental insights into protein stability, tissue dynamic proteotypes, and the role of protein phosphorylation, and is accessible via an interactive web-based portal at https://yslproteomics.shinyapps.io/tissuePPT."
Systems Biology,Metabolic modeling of microbial communities in the chicken ceca reveals a landscape of competition and co-operation,"Irina,Yi,Benjamin P.,John,Irina,Yi,Benjamin P.,John,Irina,Yi,Benjamin P.","With their ability to degrade dietary fibers to liberate otherwise unavailable substrates, members of the Bacteroidales exert a substantial influence on the microbiome of the lower intestine. Currently our knowledge of how this influence translates to the metabolic interactions that support community structure is limited. Here we applied constraints-based modeling to chicken cecal communities to investigate metabolic interactions in the presence and absence of Bacteroides. From metagenomic datasets previously generated from 30 chicken ceca, we constructed 233 metagenome-assembled genomes. Metabolic modeling of communities built from these genomes generated profiles of short chain fatty acids largely consistent with experimental assays and confirmed the role of B. fragilis as a metabolic hub, central to the production of metabolites consumed by other taxa. In its absence, communities undergo significant functional reconfiguration, with metabolic roles typically fulfilled by B. fragilis assumed by multiple taxa. Beyond B. fragilis, we found Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus crispatus also mediate influential metabolic roles that vary in the presence or absence of B. fragilis. Compensatory adaptations adopted by the microbiome in the absence of B. fragilis resulted in metabolic profiles previously associated with inflammatory bowel disease in humans, including energy deficiency, increased lactate production and altered amino acid metabolism. This work demonstrates the potential of chicken cecal microbiomes to investigate the complex metabolic interactions and key contributions that drive community dynamics."

Our analysis, supported by validation in an independent cohort, identified top APOE-associated plasma metabolites as diacylglycerols, which were increased in epsilon2-carriers and trended higher in epsilon4-carriers compared to epsilon3-homozygotes, despite the known opposing aging effects of the allele variants. 'Omics association patterns of epsilon2-carriers and increased biological age were also counter-intuitively similar, displaying increased associations between insulin resistance markers and energy-generating pathway metabolites.

Transcriptional plasticity is one important mechanism that enables host use in polyphagous insects that maintain a broad host range. However, whether specialist herbivores also rely on transcriptional plasticity to feed successfully on different hosts remains largely unexplored. Here, we measure genome-wide transcriptional plasticity of grape phylloxera, Daktulosphaira vitifoliae, a grapevine (Vitis spp.) specialist, after transfer onto different host grapevines for a single generation using RNA-seq. We show that the transcriptome of D. vitifoliae is highly plastic and responsive to host genotype - 4,820 genes (37% of the 12,876 expressed genes) are significantly differentially expressed in at least one contrast comparing host genotypes. Genes with functions related to host manipulation (predicted secretory effectors), cuticle and chitin, detoxification of xenobiotics, and development were enriched among host-responsive genes, with predicted secretory effectors being most strongly enriched (Fisher's exact test odds ratio = 8.3, BH-adjusted p-value = 0). We further linked gene co-expression modules to D. vitifoliae fitness using weighted gene co-expression network analysis. The co-expression module most strongly correlated with fitness was enriched for predicted secretory effectors, including a novel group of proline-rich genes that exist as a tandem gene cluster. The only module negatively correlated with fitness was enriched for genes encoding glycoside hydrolase enzymes that function in carbohydrate metabolism. Overall, our results show that the phylloxerid transcriptome is highly plastic and rapidly reprogrammed when transferred onto distinct hosts, which may be an adaptive mechanism underlying host use in this clonally reproducing herbivore."
Systems Biology,A Model-Driven Meta-Analysis Supports the Emerging Consensus View that Inhibitory Neurons Dominate BOLD-fMRI Responses,"Nicolas,Henrik,Sebastian,Maria,Salvador,Gunnar,Nicolas,Henrik,Sebastian,Maria,Salvador,Gunnar,Nicolas,Henrik,Sebastian,Maria,Salvador","Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a pivotal tool for mapping neuronal activity in the brain. Traditionally, the observed hemodynamic changes are assumed to reflect the activity of the most common neuronal type: excitatory neurons. In contrast, recent experiments, using optogenetic techniques, suggest that the fMRI-signal instead reflects the activity of inhibitory interneurons. However, these data paint a complex picture, with numerous regulatory interactions, and where the different experiments display many qualitative differences. It is therefore not trivial how to quantify the relative contributions of the different cell types and to combine all observations into a unified theory. To address this, we present a new model-driven meta-analysis, which provides a unified and quantitative explanation for all data. This model-driven analysis allows for quantification of the relative contribution of different cell types: the contribution to the BOLD-signal from the excitatory cells is <20 % and 50-80 % comes from the interneurons. Our analysis also provides a mechanistic explanation for the observed experiment-to-experiment differences, e.g. a biphasic vascular response dependent on different stimulation intensities and an emerging secondary post-stimulation peak during longer stimulations. In summary, our study provides a new, emerging consensus-view supporting the larger role of interneurons in fMRI."

This study presents a comprehensive, time-resolved multi-omics analysis of kidney fibrosis using an in vitro model system based on human kidney PDGFRβ+ mesenchymal cells aimed at unraveling disease mechanisms. Using transcriptomics, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and secretomics we quantified over 14,000 biomolecules across seven time points following TGF-β stimulation. This revealed distinct temporal patterns in the expression and activity of known and potential kidney fibrosis markers and modulators. Data integration resulted in time-resolved multi-omic network models which allowed us to propose mechanisms related to fibrosis progression through early transcriptional reprogramming. Using siRNA knockdowns and phenotypic assays, we validated predictions and regulatory mechanisms underlying kidney fibrosis. In particular, we show that several early-activated transcription factors, including FLI1 and E2F1, act as negative regulators of collagen deposition and propose underlying molecular mechanisms. This work advances our understanding of the pathogenesis of kidney fibrosis and provides a resource to be further leveraged by the community."
Physiology,Mice with Reduced PAR4 Reactivity show Decreased Venous Thrombosis and Platelet Procoagulant Activity,"Elizabeth A,Johana,Norman,Dante,Grace H,Anirban,Marvin T,Elizabeth A,Johana,Norman,Dante,Grace H,Anirban,Marvin T,Elizabeth A,Johana,Norman,Dante,Grace H,Anirban","Background: Hypercoagulation and thrombin generation are major risk factors for venous thrombosis. Sustained thrombin signaling through PAR4 promotes platelet activation, phosphatidylserine exposure, and subsequent thrombin generation. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in PAR4 (rs2227376) changes proline to leucine extracellular loop 3 (P310L), which decreases PAR4 reactivity and is associated with a lower risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in a GWAS meta-analysis. Objective: The goal of this study is to determine the mechanism for the association of rs2227376 with reduced risk for VTE in using mice with a homologous mutation (PAR4-P322L). Methods: Venous thrombosis was examined using our recently generated PAR4-P322L mice in the inferior vena cava stasis and stenosis models. Coagulation and clot stability was measured using rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). Thrombin generating potential was measured in platelet-rich plasma. Phosphatidylserine surface expression and platelet-neutrophil aggregates were analyzed using flow cytometry. Results: PAR4P/L and PAR4L/L had reduced incidence and size of venous clots at 48 hours. PAR4P/L and PAR4L/L platelets had progressively decreased phosphatidylserine in response to thrombin and convulxin, which led to decreased thrombin generation and decreased PAR4-mediated platelet-neutrophil aggregation. Conclusions: The leucine allele in extracellular loop 3, PAR4-322L leads to fewer procoagulant platelets and decreased endogenous thrombin potential. This decreased ability to generate thrombin offers a mechanism for PAR4s role in VTE highlighting a key role for PAR4 signaling"
Systems Biology,Thermal Proteome Profiling reveals rapid proteomic responses to redox changes in specific cellular compartments,"Aram,Alexey M,Daria,Ting,Didier M,Christine S,Ivan,Joris,Vsevolod V,Aram,Alexey M,Daria,Ting,Didier M,Christine S,Ivan,Joris,Vsevolod V,Aram,Alexey M,Daria,Ting,Didier M,Christine S,Ivan,Joris","Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) functions as a secondary messenger in cellular redox signaling, acting mainly via oxidation of protein thiols. Its spatially and temporally regulated activity within cells is essential for maintaining proper redox balance, and disruptions in these patterns can lead to oxidative stress and various related pathologies. Redox proteomics, which examines the impact of H2O2 at the proteome level, typically focuses only on thiol oxidation, overlooking broader proteomic alterations and the significance of subcellular localization in these redox processes. In this study, we address these open questions by combining chemogenetics with Thermal Proteome Profiling (TPP) to map global proteome response to compartmentalized H2O2 production. We identified hundreds of proteins with altered thermostability and/or abundance upon localized H2O2 generation in the cytosol, nucleus, and the ER lumen, highlighting their roles in cellular responses to localized H2O2. We identified proteins such as MAP2K1, PARK7, TRAP1, and UBA2 to be highly sensitive to localized H2O2 production. Furthermore, we validated their altered thermostability and found that these changes are controlled via dysregulated protein-protein interactions. This study provides a valuable resource for researchers exploring redox-mediated signal transduction and offers novel insights that could be harnessed in treating oxidative stress-induced pathologies."

G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase 2 (GRK2) is a pivotal regulator of cellular signaling whose elevation is a hallmark of heart failure progression. Its complex network of protein interactions impact a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological processes including cardiac function. In this study, we examined the effects of cardiac-restricted expression of an amino-terminal peptide of GRK2 (βARKnt) in female mice subjected to acute and chronic pressure overload. Our findings reveal that that βARKnt affects hypertrophy development and cardiac function differently in female mice than in males, leading to a transition to heart failure not observed in control females or βARKnt males. Notably, the βARKnt female mice exhibited baseline hypertrophy with distinct left atrial morphology, increased fibrosis, and immune cell infiltration compared to the controls, which progressed under chronic stress, indicating adverse cardiac remodeling. Furthermore, βARKnt female mice, unlike males, exhibit impaired tissue respiration following acute pressure overload and altered glucose sensitivity and insulin tolerance, highlighting significant remodeling of cardiac and systemic metabolism."

Maximal longevity revealed an increased average age in males. Furthermore, median lifespan differed between sex and genotype. This study supports sexual dimorphic survival in two mouse models of AD, emphasizing the need to examine mechanisms and treatments in both sexes."
Systems Biology,Unlocking the role of SH3PXD2B in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition driving Breast Cancer Lung Metastasis,"Subhajit,Riya,shailza,Subhajit,Riya,shailza,Subhajit,Riya","Despite advancements in breast cancer treatment, metastasis remains a significant challenge, contributing to high mortality rates. This study investigates the mechanisms underlying breast cancer lung metastasis, with a particular emphasis on the role of SH3PXD2B in driving epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Here, we analyzed RNA sequencing data from CCLE and TCGA databases and characterized that SH3PXD2B expression is elevated in breast cancer (BC) and lung cancer (LC) tissues compared to non-transformed tissues. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that SH3PXD2B regulates several cellular processes and is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer (BRCA) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients. Functional experiments underscore that the upregulation of SH3PXD2B promoted BC and LC cell migration in vitro; however, its knockdown inhibited the effect. Mechanistically, the mass spectrometry analysis was utilized to pull down interacting partners of SH3PXD2B, and the findings were substantiated by immunoblotting. Additionally, our findings on immunofluorescence and gene expression analysis demonstrated the additive role of SH3PXD2B and migratory proteins in promoting breast cancer progression. Further, we performed bioluminescent IVIS imaging analysis to trace the metastatic spread of MDA-MB-468 cells and observed strong signals and a high degree of dissemination to distant organs. Collectively, our results highlight the importance of SH3 domains in aggravating breast transformation, which can therefore serve as a promising therapeutic strategy in counteracting breast-related malignancy."
Physiology,Endurance exercise with reduced muscle glycogen content influences substrate utilization and attenuates acute mTORC1- and autophagic signaling in human type I and type II muscle fibers,"Oscar,Lucas,Henrik,Marcus,Sebastian,Karin,Antonio,Jorge,Eva,Oscar,Lucas,Henrik,Marcus,Sebastian,Karin,Antonio,Jorge,Eva,Oscar,Lucas,Henrik,Marcus,Sebastian,Karin,Antonio,Jorge","Background: Exercising with low muscle glycogen content can improve training adaptation, but the mechanisms underlying the muscular adaptation are still largely unknown. In this study, we measured substrate utilization and cell signaling in different muscle fiber types during exercise and investigated a possible link between these variables.
Methods: Five subjects performed a single leg cycling exercise in the evening (day 1) with the purpose of reducing glycogen stores. The following morning (day 2), they performed two-legged cycling at ~70% of VO, for 1h. Muscle biopsies were taken from both legs pre- and post-exercise for enzymatic analyses of glycogen, metabolite concentrations using LC-MS/MS-based quantification, and protein signaling using Western blot in pools of type I or type II fibers. 
Results: Glycogen content was 60-65% lower for both fiber types (P<0.01) in the leg that exercised on day 1 (low leg) compared to the other leg with normal level of glycogen (normal leg) before the cycling exercise on day 2. Glycogen utilization during exercise was significantly less in both fiber types in the low compared to the normal leg (P<0.05). In the low leg, there was a 14- and 6-fold increase in long-chain fatty acids conjugated to carnitine in type I and type II fibers, respectively, post-exercise. This increase was 3-4 times larger than in the normal leg (P<0.05). Post-exercise, mTOR, phosphorylation was increased in both fiber types in the normal leg (P<0.05) but remained unchanged in both fiber types in the low leg together with an increase in eEF2, phosphorylation in type I fibers (P<0.01). Exercise induced a reduction in the autophagy marker LC3B-II in both fiber types and legs, but the post-exercise level was higher in both fiber types in the low leg (P<0.05). Accordingly, the LC3B-II/I ratio decreased only in the normal leg (75% for type I and 87% for type II, P<0.01).
Conclusions: Starting an endurance exercise session with low glycogen availability leads to profound changes in substrate utilization in both type I and type II fibers. This may reduce the mTORC1 signaling response, primarily in type I muscle fibers, and attenuate the normally observed reduction in autophagy."
Physiology,"Academic stress through salivary biomarkers: A multivariate analysis of cortisol, IL-1β, CRP, and IgA levels and their variations as a function of sex.","Rodrigo Castillo,Camila Pezo,Luis,Veronica,Favian Treulen,Rodrigo Castillo,Camila Pezo,Luis,Veronica,Favian Treulen,Rodrigo Castillo,Camila Pezo,Luis,Veronica","Introduction: Academic stress can activate physiological changes mediated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, triggering the release of biomarkers such as cortisol and proinflammatory cytokines. Although physiological stress has been studied in relation to different inducers and diseases, there is still a gap regarding the association of academic stress with biological markers. Thus, this study aimed to associate the levels of academic stress against biological markers isolated from saliva from undergraduates' students. Materials and methods: 81 students (53 women and 28 men) were recruited and completed the SISCO inventory to determine the level of academic stress. The levels of cortisol, interleukin–1β (IL–1β), C-reactive protein (CRP) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) from saliva samples were determined by ELISA assays, and data were analyzed using ANOVA, Pearson correlation tests. A predictor model was estimated by lineal regression. Results: Stress categorization following the SISCO inventory showed that 37% of the students grouped in the low stress level (<48%), 35% grouped in the moderate stress level (>49% <60%), and 28% in high stress level (>61% <100%). The levels of salivary markers were similar across stress categories, however the trends identified–such as the decrease in cortisol and the increase in pro–inflammatory markers in male participants categorized in the high stress group–suggest a possible association between these biomarkers with academic stress gender–dependent. The multivariable model including the 4 biomarkers resulted in R2 = 0.14 with predictions that were roughly within ± 20% of stress levels. Conclusion: This research suggests a possible association between academic stress and salivary biomarkers and proposes a predictive tool for stress levels in college students. Further research will consider individual factors, longitudinal assessments, and the use of multiple psychometric tools to better define the interaction between academic stress and salivary biomarkers."
Physiology,Integrated single cell functional-proteomic profiling of human skeletal muscle reveals a shift in cellular specificity in nemaline myopathy,"Robert A E,Roger,Jenni,Chris,Lola,Edmar,Michael,Heinz,Atul Shahaji,Julien,Robert A E,Roger,Jenni,Chris,Lola,Edmar,Michael,Heinz,Atul Shahaji,Julien,Robert A E,Roger,Jenni,Chris,Lola,Edmar,Michael,Heinz,Atul Shahaji","Skeletal muscle is a complex syncytial arrangement of an array of cell types and, in the case of muscle specific cells (myofibers), sub-types. There exists extensive heterogeneity in skeletal muscle functional behaviour and molecular landscape, at the cell composition, myofiber sub-type and intra-myofiber sub-type level. This heterogeneity highlights limitations in currently applied methodological approaches, which has stagnated our understanding of fundamental skeletal muscle biology in both healthy and myopathic contexts. Here, we developed a novel approach that combines a fluorescence based assay for the biophysical examination of the sarcomeric protein, myosin, coupled with same-myofiber high sensitivity proteome profiling, termed Single Myofiber Protein Function-Omics (SMPFO). Successfully applying this approach to healthy human skeletal muscle tissue, we identify the integrate relationship between myofiber functionality and the underlying proteomic landscape that guides divergent, but physiologically important, behaviour in myofiber sub-types. By applying SMPFO to two forms of human nemaline myopathy (ACTA1 and TNNT1 mutations), we reveal significant reduction in the divergence of myofiber sub-types, across both biophysical and proteomic behaviour. Collectively, we develop SMPFO as a novel approach to study skeletal muscle with greater specificity, accuracy and resolution then currently applied methods, facilitating that advancement in understanding of SkM tissue in both healthy and diseased states."
Physiology,Increase trajectories of tendon micro vibration intensity during ankle plantar flexion: A longitudinal data analysis using latent curve models,"Tatsuhiko,Yutaka,Tatsuhiko,Yutaka,Tatsuhiko","We focus on fine vibrations originating from tendons (Mechanotendography: MTG) as a novel method for quantifying muscle activity. Quantifying muscle activity using MTG can enable measurements in daily life and long-term continuous measurements, which have been challenging for electromyography (EMG) and mechanomyography (MMG). However, the detailed trajectory of MTG increase relative to exerted muscle strength has not been clarified, nor has any mechanism of MTG generation. Our research has two objectives. The first is to clarify the detailed relationship between exerted muscle strength levels and MTG through statistical modeling. The second is to establish a highly accurate hypothesis concerning the mechanism of MTG generation based on the modeling results and physiological knowledge. We focused on the Achilles tendon to study these two objectives. Experiments were conducted on 62 participants, and MTG data were obtained at various levels of exerted muscle strength. The obtained data were structured into a longitudinal data format representing the trajectory of MTG increase with increasing exerted muscle strength. We used latent curve models (LCM) to identify this structure. By applying various LCMs to explore an optimal model, we found that the quadratic LCM received the best fit for females, while the piecewise linear LCM with a breakpoint at 50\% exerted muscle strength received the best fit for males. Notably, a significant sex difference was observed in the rate of increase in MTG at low levels of exerted muscle strength. These results suggest that MTG is caused by fine vibrations generated by muscle fiber contractions, and these fine vibrations are transmitted to the tendons connected to the muscles, where they are observed. Future research will focus on verifying this hypothesis through increased time points and physiological experiments."
Plant Biology,Exogenous selenium supplements reduce cadmium accumulation and restores micronutrient content in rice grains,"Falguni,Titir,Dr. Rita,Falguni,Titir,Dr. Rita,Falguni,Titir","Purpose: Cadmium (Cd) contamination in agricultural soil and accumulation in rice poses serious threat to human health. It is reported that Selenium (Se) can mitigate the toxic effect of Cd in rice. But the underlying mechanism of Se preventing the Cd accumulation and restoring the micronutrient content in rice grains have not been studied before. Therefore, our main aim is to reduce Cd content and restore micronutrient content in rice grain and study the mechanism. Methods: Two indigenous rice genotypes (Maharaj and Jamini) were exposed to 10 and 50 Micromolar Cd in presence and absence of Se (5 Micromolar) with a control set and assessed for plant growth, biomass, Cd content, ROS and antioxidants for Cd induced toxicity and amelioration. Genes for micronutrient transporters were studied by RT-PCR. Grain Cd and micronutrient content and agronomic parameters were also studied. Results: Se supplementation increased plant growth, biomass, and yield under Cd stress. SEM and EDX analysis revealed that Se-Cd complex formed on root surfaces restricted Cd uptake by the roots preventing root damage. Soil analysis confirmed that Se decreased Cd bioavailability, restricted root to shoot Cd translocation, ultimately reducing Cd accumulation and restoring micronutrients in grain. This was further validated by fluorescent Leadmium dye staining. In (Se+Cd) treated seedlings, up-regulation of S metabolism and nutrient transporter genes also contributed to the mitigation of Cd stress. Conclusions: So, the Se supplementation can be considered as a cost-effective, ecofriendly and sustainable approach to produce Cd free rice cultivation in Cd polluted soil."

However, the function and full genomic context of these paralogs remains uncharacterised. Here we present a highly contiguous long-read assembly of , WAI453. Using this assembly, we show that the duplication of the , and , gene families is distributed throughout the genome and pre-dates the speciation of , from its sister species. Some , paralogs have subsequently been lost or are absent in the sister species. The diversity of these paralogs was examined from , global populations and their expression was analysed during , and , growth to analyse the importance of these genes during infection. The majority of , and , paralogs in WAI453 genome were significantly upregulated during plant infection suggesting that the , and , genes harbour virulence roles. An attempt to further characterise function of NIP2.1 by infiltrating purified protein into barley leaves did not induce necrosis questioning its previously reported role as an inducer of host cell death. Together these results suggest that the , effector family does play a role during infection of barley, however the exact function of ,, like many effectors, remains uncharacterised."
Plant Biology,Parasitic-plant parasite utilizes flowering pathways at unconventional stages to form stem-derived galls,"Kanako,Naga Jyothi,Yuki,Ryo,Tsutomu,Kanako,Naga Jyothi,Yuki,Ryo,Tsutomu,Kanako,Naga Jyothi,Yuki,Ryo","Galls induced by various organisms exhibit diverse morphological and physiological characteristics, involving complex plant-insect interactions. Most transcriptome analyses to date have focused on leaf-derived galls. To better understand gall formation mechanisms, we investigated stem-derived galls induced by the weevil Smicronyx madaranus on the parasitic plant Cuscuta campestris at gene expression, cellular, and physiological levels. RNA-seq across four developmental stages identified differentially expressed genes and associated gene ontology terms. Consistent with histological observations, genes related to cell division and the cell cycle were upregulated early but decreased as the gall matured. Similar to leaf-derived galls, we found high expression of PLETHORA and meristem-related homeobox genes in early gall development, suggesting that stem cell induction and maintenance are involved in various gall types. Like leaf-derived galls, the expression of genes related to floral organ development increased through the gall development. However, their expression patterns were dramatically different: downstream genes in the flowering pathway were highly expressed at the initial gall stage, whereas upstream genes were highly expressed later. This suggests that the weevil might activate the flowering pathway at unconventional stages, potentially rerouting the typical flowering cascade to influence gall development. Unlike the decrease in photosynthesis-related genes in leaf-derived galls, we observed an increase in these genes in galls formed on the stem of the holoparasitic plant. Shading experiments confirmed that photosynthesis is crucial for both gall growth and the weevil. This study highlights how gall-inducers can co-opt host resources and genetic pathways, offering new insights into the complexity of plant-insect interactions."
Physiology,Substantial Braking Force of Anterior Tibial Translation Induces the Spontaneous Healing of Murine Anterior Cruciate Ligament,"Riku,Kazuki,Yuna,Saaya,Koyo,Takanori,Riku,Kazuki,Yuna,Saaya,Koyo,Takanori,Riku,Kazuki,Yuna,Saaya,Koyo","The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) has been recognized to have no spontaneous healing capacity after complete rupture due to an intra-articular environment. Meanwhile, our group reported that a completely ruptured ACL could heal spontaneously by restabilizing the femur-tibia joint. Several clinical studies have recently reported that ruptured ACL could heal spontaneously by controlling abnormal joint movement. Appropriate mechanical stimulation on the ruptured ACL promotes spontaneous healing, whereas excessive mechanical stress may inhibit the healing response. Here, we investigated how much braking force to control anterior tibial translation (ATT) affects the healing response of the ACL using two different braking forces for controlled ATT (CATT) models. Male and female C57BL/6 mice were ruptured ACL and randomly classified into Tight-CATT, Loose-CATT, and ACL-Rupture (ACL-R) groups. The Tight-CATT group showed a higher success rate of ACL healing than the Loose-CATT group at 4 and 8 weeks. However, collagen maturation and mechanical properties on healed ACL did not differ between the Tight-CATT and Loose-CATT groups. Our results suggested that tight ATT braking immediately after injury is essential for successfully healing the completely ruptured ACL. On the other hand, tightly ATT in the early healing phase was insufficient to improve mechanical strength and collagen maturation. Therefore, we should control mechanical stress tightly in the early phase of ACL spontaneous healing, and it would be necessary to apply higher mechanical stress in the later phases to achieve greater healing of the ACL."

Efficient farming of insects to meet this demand depends on an understanding of insect life history. Yet, detailed information and expertise about a single species are not always available for practitioners to make informed decisions about rearing practices or identify arising issues. The cricket (,) is commonly farmed for human consumption or animal feed, but few studies have characterized the life history of this species throughout ontogeny. Here, we describe the growth and development of , from hatch to adulthood and quantify reproductive traits relevant to mass-rearing and colony management, including egg development. This information provides foundation to start and manage a cricket colony and to conduct research on growth and performance. We highlight ways that a fundamental understanding of cricket biology can be informative for optimizing cricket growth, reducing variability in yield and informing future precision farming practices."
Physiology,Plasticity in cryoprotectant synthesis involves coordinated shunting away from pyruvate production,"Karin R. L.,Yasmin,Katie,Amanda,Katie Elizabeth,Karin R. L.,Yasmin,Katie,Amanda,Katie Elizabeth,Karin R. L.,Yasmin,Katie,Amanda","Insects living in temperate regions often accumulate a large amount of glycerol during winter to avoid freezing. This seasonal accrual of glycerol is generally produced from glycogen reserves through the pentose phosphate pathway. An alternative pathway to produce glycerol is through glycolysis, normally used for pyruvate production for eventual ATP synthesis. Aside from seasonal accumulation, some insects will also rapidly increase glycerol production as a short-term response to a sudden cold event, thereby increasing cold hardiness when necessary. In the eastern spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana, this plasticity in cold hardiness is locally adapted, where northern populations produce more glycerol upon cold shock. Here we investigate how glycerol is produced during the rapid plastic response to fluctuating cold conditions, and whether this pathway could be a target of local adaptation. After a period of repeated cold exposure, we found evidence of increased enzyme activity and increased mRNA abundance of several proteins associated with glycolysis, and a downregulation in expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, associated with pentose phosphate. Pyruvate production is prevented through downregulation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. We found higher overall enzyme activity and glycerol accumulation in a northern population from Alberta, although there was no evidence of an interaction effect between population and cold shock treatment. This is one the first studies to show a mechanistic basis of such plasticity in cold hardiness."

This intersegmental coordination (IC) of the lower limb elevation angles is called planar covariation law. Thickness of the IC plane is associated with gait variability. Research question: How are anteroposterior and lateral gait variabilities influenced by sinusoidal speed changes with different amplitudes (±0.33 vs. ±0.67 m/s) and periods (30 vs. 60 s)? Which limbs are responsible for the step variabilities in these conditions? Methods: We quantified the IC plane thickness, coefficient of variance of step width (CVSW), time delay of step length (TDSL), and step frequency (TDSF) in 18 healthy young adults. We applied statistical parametric mapping for the time courses of each limb angle during the acceleration and deceleration phases. Results: The IC plane thickness was greater in the ±0.67 m/s condition than in the ±0.33 m/s condition. Periods and amplitudes did not affect CVSW, TDSL, and TDSF. In the middle gait cycle, the thigh and shank were delayed in the greater amplitude condition during the acceleration phase but proceeded in the same condition during the deceleration phase. Significance: Sinusoidal speed amplitude influenced anteroposterior gait variability, but not lateral gait variability, regardless of period, even in healthy young adults. More distal limbs were delayed in the greater speed amplitude condition during the acceleration phase, whereas more proximal limbs proceeded in that condition during the deceleration phase, indicating that these different behaviors of the lower limb segments could be related to step variabilities."

In our previous study, we identified LluR1, the first C. lupini resistance gene, in a wild Lupinus luteus accession. Further research was necessary to unravel the defense mechanisms involved. Histological analysis revealed a hypersensitive response against C. lupini, while transcriptome analysis highlighted a complex network of differentially expressed genes, including TIR-NBS-LRR proteins, hypersensitive response, and phenylpropanoid pathways. SNPs were identified that distinguish the protein sequences underlying immunity. These findings, along with orthology in other lupin species, offer valuable insights for developing breeding strategies to enhance C. lupini resistance in lupins, with significant potential impacts on food, feed, and human nutrition."

Despite the central importance of signaling in biomedical research, our ability to quantify it in individual cells over time remains limited. Here, we introduce INSCRIBE, an approach for reconstructing signaling history in single cells using endpoint fluorescence images. By regulating a CRISPR base editor, INSCRIBE generates mutations in genomic target sequences, at a rate proportional to signaling activity. The number of edits is then recovered through a novel ratiometric readout strategy, from images of two fluorescence channels. We engineered human cell lines for recording WNT and BMP pathway activity, and demonstrated that INSCRIBE faithfully recovers both the intensity and duration of signaling. Further, we used INSCRIBE to study the variability of cellular response to WNT and BMP stimulation, and test whether the magnitude of response is a stable, heritable trait. We found a persistent memory in the BMP pathway. Progeny of cells with higher BMP response levels are likely to respond more strongly to a second BMP stimulation, up to 3 weeks later. Together, our results establish a scalable platform for genetic recording and , readout of signaling history in single cells, advancing quantitative analysis of cell-cell communication during development and disease."
Zoology,A hydrodynamic antenna: novel lateral line system in the tail of myliobatid stingrays,"Júlia,George V.,Júlia,George V.,Júlia","Eagle rays, cownose rays, and manta rays (family Myliobatidae) have a slender tail that can be longer than the animal’s body length, but its function and structure are unknown. Using histology, immunohistochemistry, and 3D imaging with micro-CT scans, we describe the anatomy and function of the tail in ,, the cownose ray. The tail is an extension of the vertebral column with unique morphological specializations. Along the tail behind the barb, vertebral centra are absent and neural and hemal arches fuse and form a solid mineralized structure that we term the caudal synarcual, which imparts passive stiffness to the tail, reducing bending. Two lateral line canals connected to an extensive tubule network extend along both sides of the tail. Tubules branch from the lateral line canal toward the dorsal and ventral tail surfaces and open to the surrounding water via pores. A continuous neuromast is located within each lateral line canal, maintaining an interrupted structure along the entire tail. The complex lateral line mechanosensory system in the tail of , supports the hypothesis that the tail functions like a hydrodynamic sensory antenna and may play an important role in their behavioral and functional ecology."

We characterized their ability to detect TNT in a natural soil system, measuring single-cell and population-level behavior over a 28-day period. The autonomous microbial sensor activated its response by 14-fold when exposed to low TNT concentrations and maintained stable activation for over 21 days, exhibiting exponential decay dynamics at the population-level with a half-life of about 5 days.

We present a method where DNA symbols, or oligos designed to encode information for data storage, are joined to linker sequences at either end. These linkers dictate the assembly order of the symbols; the order of the symbols can be changed by changing the sequences of the linkers attached to them. Utilizing a ligating DNAzyme as a catalytic splint, we achieve room-temperature, enzyme-free assembly, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional enzyme-based ligation methods. We demonstrate this technique by assembling three different five-symbol constructs, with the order of the symbols determined by their linking ends. This linker directed assembly technique allows data-encoding symbols to be assembled in any desired order. Furthermore, the DNAzyme-based assembly method is versatile and can be applied to various DNA assembly applications, particularly where cost-effectiveness and efficient room-temperature ligation are required."
Synthetic Biology,A robust synthetic biology toolkit to advance carboxysome study and redesign,"Daniel S.,Y,Anthony G.,Cesar R.,Daniel S.,Y,Anthony G.,Cesar R.,Daniel S.,Y,Anthony G.","Carboxysomes are polyhedral protein organelles that microorganisms use to facilitate carbon dioxide assimilation. They are composed of a modular protein shell which envelops an enzymatic core mainly comprised of physically coupled Rubisco and carbonic anhydrase. While the modular construction principles of carboxysomes make them attractive targets as customizable metabolic platforms, their size and complexity can be a hinderance. In this work, we design and validate a plasmid set – the pXpressome toolkit -in which α-carboxysomes are robustly expressed and remain intact and functional after purification. We tested this toolkit by introducing mutations which influence carboxysome structure and performance. We find that deletion of vertex-capping genes results in formation of larger carboxysomes while deletion of facet forming genes produces smaller particles, suggesting that adjusting the ratio of these proteins can rationally affect morphology. Through a series of fluorescently labeled constructs, we observe this toolkit leads to more uniform expression and better cell health than previously published carboxysome expression systems. Overall, the pXpressome toolkit facilitates the study and redesign of carboxysomes with robust performance and improved phenotype uniformity. The pXpressome toolkit will support efforts to remodel carboxysomes for enhanced carbon fixation or serve as a platform for other nanoencapsulation goals."
Synthetic Biology,Spheroplasted cells: a game changer for DNA delivery to diatoms,"E.J.L.,M.,G.,B.J.K.,E.J.L.,M.,G.,B.J.K.,E.J.L.,M.,G.","Diatoms, vital to global carbon fixation and climate change mitigation, produce 20% of the world’s fixed organic carbon annually. Their potential as cell factories for biofuels, proteins, and other high value chemicals remains underutilized due to a lack of genetic engineering tools, with DNA delivery being the biggest challenge. Here, we present an optimized, highly efficient electroporation method for delivering DNA constructs as large as 55.6 kb to ,, a model diatom species and emerging chassis for algal biotechnology. We also demonstrate that with this optimized protocol, episomes can be assembled ,, forgoing the need for time-consuming traditional cloning steps in , and ,.

Synthetic Biology,Template-Independent Enzymatic RNA Synthesis,"Nilesh B,Tatiana,Taylor,Leonardo,Marc,Richard,Steven A,Nilesh B,Tatiana,Taylor,Leonardo,Marc,Richard,Steven A,Nilesh B,Tatiana,Taylor,Leonardo,Marc,Richard","A route to prepare ribonucleoside triphosphates featuring a 3’-aminoxy (3’-O-NH,) removable blocking group is reported here. We then show that versions of two DNA polymerases, human DNA polymerase theta (Polθ) and mimiviral PrimPol, accept these triphosphates as substrates to add single nucleotides to an RNA primer under engineered conditions. Cleaving the O-N bond in the 3’-O-NH, group within the extended primer regenerates the 3’-OH group, facilitating subsequent polymerase cycles that add a second, selected, nucleotide. These enzymes and triphosphates together enable template-independent enzymatic RNA synthesis (TIERS) exploiting a cyclic reversible termination framework. The study shows that this process is ready for instrument adaptation by using it to add three ribonucleotides in three cycles using an engineered Polθ. This work creates a new way to synthesize RNA with a de novo defined sequence, without requiring the protecting groups, hazardous solvents, and sensitive reagents that bedevil phosphoramidite-based RNA synthesis."

Sesame yield improvement using molecular-biotechnological tools involving gene manipulation is a better alternative than traditional breeding because it requires less time, effort, and labour. Protoplasts are plant cells devoid of the cell wall. Protoplast systems are deployed as versatile cell-based tools for tissue culture, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenetics studies leading to crop improvement. Inadequate reports of sesame protoplasts restrict its potential use in this crop. In the present study, we are reporting the successful isolation and purification of sesame protoplasts from four different sesame explants: hypocotyl, internode, leaf, and hypocotyl-derived callus using the one-step enzymatic digestion method. We have carefully optimised enzyme combinations, digestion durations, temperatures, and shaking speeds for every tested explant to obtain the highest protoplast yield and viability. Maximum yield (9.9 x 10, protoplasts/gm fresh weight) and viability (92.1%) were achieved from callus explants. We purified isolated protoplasts by floating them over a 20% (w/v) sucrose solution. Among tested media, callus-derived protoplasts divided rapidly in Murashige and Skoog broth medium supplemented with 17.77 μM 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 0.54 μM α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). In the same medium, protoplasts divided into the 2-cell stage after 2-3 days of culture and progressed to the micro-callus stage at 0.24 ± 0.05% frequency within 16-20 days of culture. Sesame protoplasts could be an excellent system for investigating potential avenues for biotechnological improvements of sesame including transient gene expression and CRISPR-based studies."

Synthetic Biology,An Expanded Substrate Scope for Cross-Chiral Ligation Enables Efficient Synthesis of Long L-RNAs,"Xuan,Jonathan T.,Xuan,Jonathan T.,Xuan","Despite the growing interest in mirror-image L-oligonucleotides, both as a robust nucleic acid analogue and as an artificial genetic polymer, their broader adoption in research and medicine remains hindered by challenges associated with the synthesis of long sequences, especially for L-RNA. Herein, we present a novel strategy for assembling long L-RNAs via the joining of two or more shorter fragments using cross-chiral ligase ribozymes together with new substrate activation chemistry. We show that 5′-monophosphorylated L-RNA, which is readily prepared by solid phase synthesis, can be activated by chemical attachment of a 5′-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) or diphosphate (ADP), yielding 5′-adenosyl (di-or tri-) phosphate L-RNA. The activation reaction is performed in mild aqueous conditions, proceeds efficiently with short or large L-RNA, and, yielding few biproducts, requires little or no further purification after activation. Importantly, both groups, when added to L-RNA, are compatible with ribozyme-mediated ligation, with the 5′-adenosyl triphosphate permitting rapid and efficient joining of multiple, long L-RNA strands. This is exemplified by the assembly of a 129-nt L-RNA molecule via a single cross-chiral ligation event. Overall, by relying on ribozymes that can be readily prepared by , transcription and L-RNA substrates that can be activated through simple chemistry, these methods are expected to make long L-RNAs more accessible to a wider range of researchers and facilitate the expansion of L-ON-based technologies."

Here, we developed a reconstituted system capable of sustainably regenerating all 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), which are major components of the translation system. To achieve this, we needed five types of improvements: 1) optimization of aaRS sequences for efficient translation, 2) optimization of the composition of the translation system to enhance translation, 3) employment of another bacterial AlaRS and SerRS to improve each aminoacylation activity, 4) diminishing the translational inhibition caused by certain aaRS sequences by codon optimization and EF-P addition, and 5) balancing the DNA concentrations of 20 aaRSs to match each requirement. After these improvements, we succeeded in the sustainable regeneration of all 20 aaRSs for up to 20 cycles of 2.5-fold serial dilutions. These methodologies and results provide a substantial advancement toward the realization of self-reproducible artificial systems."
Synthetic Biology,Chemically defined lipid diets reveal the versatility of lipidome remodeling in genomically minimal cells,"Nataliya,Lisa,Jana,Karim,James P.,Nataliya,Lisa,Jana,Karim,James P.,Nataliya,Lisa,Jana,Karim","All cells are encapsulated in a lipid membrane that provides a responsive interface between life and its environment. Although simple membranes can be built from a single type of lipid, cellular membranes contain 10s to 100s of unique lipid species. Deciphering the significance of lipidome complexity is a central challenge in understanding the design principles of living membranes. While functions of individual lipids have been extensively studied, understanding how lipidomes collectively contribute to membrane function and cell phenotypes is experimentally challenging in most organisms. To address this challenge, we turned to the simple pathogenic organism , and its genomically derived “Minimal Cell” JCVI-syn3B, to establish a living minimal membrane model system in which lipidome complexity can be experimentally manipulated. By complexing lipids with cyclodextrins, we introduce a chemically defined approach to deliver lipid ‘diets’ with different chemistries to cells, resulting in cellular lipidomes with as few as seven to nearly 30 lipids species. We explored how lipidome size and composition influences cell growth, osmotic sensitivity, and membrane adaptability to changes in growth temperature. Our findings indicate that lipidome composition dictates membrane adaptation to temperature change. Moreover, we show that lipidome diversity enhances cellular robustness to hypoosmotic shock. We further show that impaired acyl chain remodeling in the minimal cell is associated with impaired membrane temperature adaptation. Finally, we demonstrate as a proof of principle, how cells with tuneable lipidomes can be used as experimental chassis for screening membrane active antimicrobial peptides. Our study introduces an experimental resource and foundation for deciphering the role of lipidome complexity in membrane function and cellular fitness."

Herein, we describe the construction of a biotin-independent yeast strain by engineering a bypass of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, an essential biotin-dependent enzyme in the synthesis of fatty acids. Besides complete rescue of growth in biotin-free media, the resulting , strains showed significantly improved growth on malonate compared to biotin.

Scientific Communication and Education,A ChatGPT Assisted Reading Protocol for Undergraduate Research Students Engaging with Biophysics Literature,"Marcus,Gonzalo R.,Anne V.,Frank X.,Marcus,Gonzalo R.,Anne V.,Frank X.,Marcus,Gonzalo R.,Anne V.","A major challenge for undergraduate students engaged in research is reading scientific literature. This is especially true for students engaged in biophysics research, where many of the concepts, definitions, and experimental methodologies discussed may be beyond the material covered in standard undergraduate courses. Without specific guidance on how to read journal articles, students can become overwhelmed, which may lead to students reading fewer papers and not engaging with the scientific literature related to their research. To help undergraduate students effectively engage with scientific papers, we have developed a guided reading protocol that combines pre-reading strategies, structured notetaking, and the use of ChatGPT. Using ChatGPT in this protocol allows students to clarify unfamiliar terms and concepts in an interactive way that helps them to integrate the paper’s content into their own understanding. To test the impact of this protocol, participants in this study were given an initial survey to determine their comfort and experience with reading scientific literature. After this they were given an abridged biophysics paper and the ChatGPT assisted guided reading protocol. The ChatGPT transcripts were analyzed using open coding and the students were given a post-study survey to determine how they felt about their experience using ChatGPT. We found that most students do not appear to engage with the literature regularly, which may be due to barriers they encounter in terms of new and unknown content. Analyzing their conversations with the chatbot, we observed that students asked for definitions, explanations of unknown concepts, summaries of text or their own understanding, and simplifications of the text. Overall, students reported in the post-implementation survey that using ChatGPT was a positive experience and all students reported that they expected to use ChatGPT in the future when reading scientific literature. From this work, we believe that this new chatbot assisted reading protocol may be a way to keep novice biophysics students from becoming discouraged when they begin reading scientific literature and help keep them engaged with the current literature in the field."

We screened synthetic cell models, including giant unilamellar vesicles, coacervates, microdroplet emulsions, proteinosomes, and colloidosomes, for their ability to form hybrid tumoroids. Our results identify the balance of inter- and extracellular adhesion and synthetic cell surface tension as key material properties driving successful co-assembly of hybrids. We further demonstrate that these synthetic cells can establish artificial tumor immune microenvironments (ART-TIMEs), mimicking immunogenic signals within tumoroids. Using the ART-TIME approach, we identify co-signaling mechanisms between PD-1 and CD2 as a driver in immune evasion of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Our findings demonstrate the 3D bottom-up self-assembly of hybrid cancer microenvironments to replace immune components with defined bionic materials, pushing the boundaries to functionally integrating living and non-living matter."

We demonstrate the plug-and-play versatility of GrowBio in the production of the structurally complex animal biopigment xanthommatin, a color-changing ommochrome with material and cosmetic potential. Xanthommatin biosynthesis directly fuels growth of a newly designed , 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate auxotroph (PUMA). Aided by genome-scale metabolic modeling, PUMA was designed and built to be controlled by endogenous formate co-produced as a coupled biosynthetic byproduct in the multistep conversion of tryptophan to xanthommatin. Adaptive laboratory evolution was utilized to streamline xanthommatin’s gram-scale bioproduction via growth rate selection, establishing GrowBio as a promising biotechnological approach for establishing and optimizing the microbial production of value-added molecules."

One way is through their follow-up behaviors, which are the specific strategies instructors implement after active learning activities. These behaviors could play an important role in student learning as students can receive feedback from the instructor. However, there is little research on the effects of different types of follow-up behaviors. Follow-up after active learning can be seen as a form of discourse between the instructor and the entire class. Previous researchers developed the Classroom Discourse Observation Protocol (CDOP) to analyze discourse between the instructor and individual students or small groups. We used CDOP as a starting point to develop and validate a new protocol, the Follow-Up Discourse Observation Protocol (FUDOP), to characterize instructional follow-up behaviors to the entire class after active-learning activities. We then used FUDOP to characterize follow-up behaviors of multiple instructors in introductory biology courses at three different universities. We measured consistent differences in these behaviors across instructors but not within instructors, demonstrating that instructors may engage in consistent follow-up behaviors. FUDOP could allow instructors and researchers to better measure and analyze follow-up behaviors and their effects, which could in turn provide guidance to instructors and faculty developers."

Our approach focuses on challenges in specifying scientific studies for scientific inference via statistical inference, and is complementary to classical discussions in philosophy of statistics. We particularly consider the challenges in replicating studies exactly, using the notion of the idealized experiment. We argue against treating reproducibility as an inherently desirable property of scientific results, and in favor of viewing it as a tool to measure distance between an original study and its replications. To sensibly study the implications of replicability and results reproducibility on inference, such a measure of replication distance is needed. We present an effort to delineate such a framework here, addressing some challenges in capturing the components of scientific studies while identifying others as ongoing issues. We illustrate our measure of replication distance by simulations using a toy example. Rather than replications, we present purposefully planned modifications as an appropriate tool to inform scientific inquiry. Our ability to measure replication distance serves scientists in their search for replication-ready studies. We believe that likelihood-based and evidential approaches may play a critical role towards building a statistics that effectively serves the practical needs of science."

In field studies, identifying kin typically relies in part on genetic analysis, especially for discriminating paternal relationships. Such analyses assume knowledge of Mendelian inheritance, genotyping technologies, and basic statistical inference. Consequently, they can be difficult for students to grasp, particularly through traditional lecture formats. Here, we investigate whether integrating an additional active learning approach—interaction with a Shiny web application,, which implements a popular paternity inference approach in an accessible graphical user interface—improves student understanding of genetic kinship analysis in molecular primatology. We do so in the context of a non-traditional learning environment in Kenya, a developing nation in which students have limited access to technology, and where the efficacy of educational Shiny apps has never been assessed. Twenty-eight (28) participants with diverse educational backgrounds attended an introductory lecture on genetics and paternity inference, completed a pre-test, interacted with , via a structured set of exercises and questions, and then completed a post-test and survey about their experience and subjective understanding.

Previous studies have identified phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming as early predictors. However, the graphic complexity of Arabic letters imposes particular constraints on the visual system, which should mobilize visual attention. To test this hypothesis, 101 Arabic-speaking children who just began their formal reading instruction in Arabic were administered tests of syllable and word reading. Their nonverbal reasoning, vocabulary, phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming and letter knowledge were measured. Their visual attention was estimated through tasks of visual attention span. We found that phonological awareness, visual attention span and letter knowledge were associated with reading outcomes. However, regression analyses showed that the relationship between visual attention span and reading disappeared when letter knowledge was taken-into-account. We used structural equation modeling to examine the direct and indirect effects of visual attention span to reading. Results showed that phonological awareness and letter knowledge were significant and independent predictors of reading while visual attention span contributed only indirectly through its influence on letter knowledge. Our findings suggest that beginning readers rely on visual attention to identify and discriminate visually-complex Arabic letters. In turn, more efficient letter identification in children with higher visual attention facilitates reading acquisition. These findings support the cognitive models of word recognition that include visual attention as a component of the reading system. They open new perspectives for cross-language studies, suggesting that visual attention might contribute differently to reading depending on the orthographic system. They also provide a foundation for innovative teaching methodologies in Arabic language education."

Aphids are one of the biggest group of ectotherms that transmit viruses to plants; more than 200 species have been identified as pathogen vectors. These aphids are responsible for transmitting over 300 viruses. The life-history traits of aphids such as fecundity and survival respond strongly and non-linearly to temperature and therefore to global warming. In this study, we elaborate the thermal responses for the main life-history traits (i.e, development and mortality rate) for aphid species for which data were available or generated. Also, thermal responses for virus transmission rates were elaborated to describe plant host to vector and vector to plant host dynamics. With these data, we elaborated thermal suitability models which were used to map current and projected scenarios for the transmission of viruses by aphids. Data was only available/generated for 19 aphid species, many of which only have data either at the lower or upper thermal limits. For virus transmission rates, from host plant to vector and from vector to plant data was only available/generated for potato virus Y (PVY), potato virus A (PVA), and potato leaf roll virus (PLRV) transmitted by the aphid ,. Projections show that virus transmission by aphids will shift to northern latitudes. Understanding the thermal biology of aphids is crucial for developing effective measures to safeguard agriculture, especially staple crops, and food security in the context of climate change."

Cells in G1 undergo a transient nuclear peak of glutathione (GSH) prior to coordinated entry into S phase followed by rapid divisions and cellular reprogramming. A symplastic block of the ground tissue impairs regeneration, which is rescued by exogenous GSH. We propose a model in which GSH from the outer tissues is released upon injury licensing an exit from G1 near the wound to induce rapid cell division and reprogramming."

Cardiac glycosides, along with additional specialized metabolites, also contribute to the ethnobotanical uses of A. curassavica. To facilitate further research on milkweed metabolism, we assembled the 197 Mbp genome of a fifth-generation inbred line of A. curassavica into 619 contigs, with an N50 of 10 Mbp. Scaffolding resulted in 98% of the assembly being anchored to 11 chromosomes, which are mostly colinear with the previously assembled common milkweed (A. syriaca) genome. Assembly completeness evaluations showed that 98% of the BUSCO gene set is present in the A. curassavica genome assembly. The transcriptomes of six tissue types (young leaves, mature leaves, stems, flowers, buds, and roots), with and without defense elicitation by methyl jasmonate treatment, showed both tissue-specific gene expression and induced expression of genes that may be involved in cardiac glycoside biosynthesis. Expression of a CYP87A gene, the predicted first gene in the cardiac glycoside biosynthesis pathway, was observed only in the stems and roots and was induced by methyl jasmonate. Together, this genome sequence and transcriptome analysis provide important resources for further investigation of the ecological and medicinal uses of A. curassavica."
Plant Biology,Three cytochrome P450 enzymes catalyse the formation of furanoclerodane precursors in Salvia spp.,"Ruoxi,Haixiu,Yiren,Zhuo,Licheng,Gerhard,Carlo,Cathie,Evangelos,Ruoxi,Haixiu,Yiren,Zhuo,Licheng,Gerhard,Carlo,Cathie,Evangelos,Ruoxi,Haixiu,Yiren,Zhuo,Licheng,Gerhard,Carlo,Cathie","Salvia species native to the Americas are rich in valuable bioactive furanoclerodanes, like the psychoactive salvinorin A found in Salvia divinorum, which is used in treatment of opioid addiction. However, there is relatively little known about their biosynthesis. To address this, we investigated the biosynthesis of salviarin, the simplest furanoclerodane structure in the ornamental sage Salvia splendens. Using a self-organizing map and mutual rank analysis of RNA-seq co-expression data, we identified three cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for converting kolavenol into salviarin precursors, consecutively: annonene, hardwickiic acid and hautriwaic acid. As annonene and hardwickiic acid have also been proposed as intermediates in the biosynthesis of salvinorin A, and to examine our hypothesis for common evolutionary origin of the furanoclerodane pathway between the two Salvia species, we searched for homologous genes in available data for S. divinorum. The enzymes encoded by orthologous genes from S. divinorum displayed kolavenol synthase (SdKLS), annonene synthase (SdANS), and hardwickiic acid synthase (SdHDAS) activity respectively, supporting the view that these are intermediate steps in the biosynthesis of salvinorin A. We investigated the origin of annonene synthase and the role of gene duplication in the evolution of this specific activity. Our work shows how S. splendens can serve as a model species for studying furanoclerodanes biosynthesis in Salvia species, contributes to understanding the evolution of specialized metabolism in plants, and provides new tools to produce salvinorin A in biotechnological chassis."

In this study, we collected RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from , registered in public databases and conducted a meta-analysis integrating multiple studies. We analyzed 105 paired RNA-Seq datasets from resistant or susceptible , cultivars under salt and drought conditions to identify novel stress-responsive genes with common expression changes across these datasets. A meta-analysis identified 10 genes specifically upregulated in resistant cultivars and 12 specifically upregulated in susceptible cultivars under both drought and salt conditions. Furthermore, by comparing previously identified stress-responsive genes in ,, we explored genes potentially involved in stress response mechanisms that are conserved across plant species.

They derive from secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga by an unknown heterotrophic eukaryote, leading to a complex intracellular organization. In response to unfavorable conditions (stress), diatoms store oil in lipid droplets (LD), raising interest for applications, in particular biofuels. In spite of numerous investigations aiming to increase their oil content, LD biogenesis mechanisms in these organisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we functionally characterized the homolog of Seipin, a major actor of LD biogenesis, in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. PtSeipin shares conserved structural features with other Seipins, yet presents unique characteristics, that appear common to diatoms and more broadly Stramenopiles. We provide evidence that Stramenopiles Seipins were inherited from the host during secondary endosymbiosis. The localization of PtSeipin highlights that LD biogenesis can arise simultaneously from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plastid's most external membrane. Finally, the knock-out of PtSeipin leads to a strong increase of TAG accumulation, a feature that is not observed in other organisms and is greatly enhanced following high light exposure. Our results suggest a redirection of lipid fluxes towards TAG synthesis, reduced TAG recycling or a combination of both."

The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains three loci for genes encoding H-protein. We show that in land plants, there are two clades of mitochondrial H-proteins; one that clusters with H1 and H3, and another that clusters with H2, an isoform mostly expressed in heterotrophic tissue and for which a null mutation results in a >99% impeded growth. After showing that all three isoforms fulfill the same metabolic function, we evidenced that the impaired root growth in h2 results from an altered cell cycle progression concomitant to a lower Target Of Rapamycin kinase activity. Subsequent metabolomic approaches revealed an accumulation of storage sugars and a significant decrease of the TCA intermediates and several vitamins in the h2 root cells as compared to the wild-type ones. 
Additional investigations evidenced that H2 acts as the main relay for lipoylation in root mitochondria, which diverges from the current lipoylation model proposed for photosynthetic tissues. Together, this work provides new insight on the control of the cell cycle by mitochondrial metabolism, and also challenges the current dogma for lipoylation in mitochondria of plant cells."

Abul,Afifa,Ankon,Shahina,Takashi","The current study aimed to optimize the fasting duration in order to mitigate the detrimental effects of heat stress on broilers raised in hot and humid climatic environments. A total of 500 broiler DOCs were assigned to five distinct treatment groups: Tₒ= Non-fasted controlled temperature (24-26℃) (NF-CT), T,= Non-fasted heat stressed (30-38℃) (NF-HS), T,= 6 hours fasted heat stressed (6-h FHS), T,= 8 hours fasted heat stressed (8-h FHS), and T,= 10 hours fasted heat stressed (10-h FHS). Each treatment was replicated five times, with 20 birds in each replicate group. As expected, the birds in NF-CT group showed significantly better performances for all the growth parameters, although birds who fasted for 8-h under heat stress exerted better growth and FCR in comparison to the other HS groups. Fasting of birds under heat stress significantly showed the lowest mortality. Like the NF-CT group, birds in 8-h FHS achieved significantly higher dressing percentage, breast meat, liver yields, and the lowest abdominal fat. Fasting for 8- and 10-h significantly increased breast meat pH and water holding capacity and thus reduced cooking loss. Fasting also improved the breast meat color quality by increasing redness (a*) and reducing the hue angle values comparable with the NF-CT group. A significantly upward trend in villi height (VH), width (VW) and crypt depth (CD) of gut segments was also observed in the birds of the 8-h FHS group. Total bacterial and coliform counts in cecum contents were reduced significantly with the increase in the fasting period. Benefit-cost analysis showed better profitability in the 8-h FHS group than other HS groups. Taken altogether, it can be concluded that broiler chicken exposed to 8-h fasting period is an effective approach to mitigate heat stress under hot and humid climatic conditions."

In this context, lignans are potential defensive substances that accumulate in plants during abiotic stresses. Flax (, L.) is one of the richest lignan source. Plant genotypes differ in lignan contents. Therefore, to draw a correlation between genotype-specific lignan content and plant salinity-adaptiveness, we compared two flax varieties Flanders and Astella, where Flanders has higher lignan contents than Astella. We used a 1-week NaCl stress for the study. Post-stress morphological analyses revealed comparatively higher growth arrest in Flanders, suggesting its energy and resource-saving behaviour than Astella. Salinity-mediated reactive oxygen species production and associated cell damage were relatively greater in Astella than in Flanders. In biochemical stress marker assays, we found comparatively upregulated antioxidants and osmoprotection machinery in Flanders, showing its higher ROS scavenging and cellular protection capabilities than Astella. Moreover, the two-tailed qPCR assay showed comparatively higher upregulation of three lignan biosynthesis-related miRNAs - miR168a, miR399g, and miR828a in stressed Flanders indicating its emphasised involvement of lignans in salt stress mitigation. The results depict the superiority of Flanders in salt stress mitigation over Astella."

Information on the genetic variability and trait associations of common bean in the Sekota district of north Western Ethiopia is inadequate. This study was initiated with the objective to assess variability, heritability and trait association among 64 common bean genotypes for quantitative traits using 8x8 simple lattice design at Aybra main research site 2023 under rain fed conditions. Analysis of variance was performed using SAS software and the ANOVA revealed highly significant variations among genotypes for all the traits considered in the study. The yield ranged from 1633.1 to 3702.10 kg ha, with a mean of 2542.53 kg ha,. There was a yield advantage of 24.56 to 55.89% over the checks. A moderate genotypic coefficient of variation coupled with high heritability and high genetic advance as a percentage of the mean was obtained for plant height, branches per plant, hundred seed weight, seed yield, and harvest index. Branches per plant, aboveground biomass and harvest index had significant positive correlations and direct effects on seed yield at the genotypic and phenotypic levels while days to maturity had a significant negative correlation and indirect effect with seed yield at the genotypic. The maximum inter cluster distance was found between clusters VII and 8 (D, =351.39), followed by clusters V and VIII (D, =331.23). The first five principal component axes accounted for 74.3% of the total variation, with eigenvalues greater than unity. The number of days to maturity, plant height, number of pods per plant, number seeds per pod, seed yield, and harvest index were the traits that contributed most of the variation in the first PCs. Generally, the presence of variability, and strong positive association of traits among the genotypes were observed in the traits under study. Therefore, selection based on agronomic performance and hybridization based on cluster distance could be possible for the improvement of common bean in the study area."

The goal of this analysis is to determine which approaches (including groups of focus, research methods, and settings/perspectives) from social science fields (i.e., psychology, sociology, and anthropology) are utilized in published peer-reviewed biology education research relating to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Scoping how social science approaches are used in this area is important to understanding whether biology education research could benefit from complementary approaches that might advance praxis. This analysis found that research informing the biology education community draws heavily from psychological perspectives that are overwhelmingly not disaggregated (78% of articles identifying a group used a lumped together one), are by far more quantitative (58% used survey, 26% grades, 20% school data) than qualitative (17% used interview, 10% observation), and did not (72%) adopt structural approaches.

This has important implications for education, biology education, biology education research, social science, and research in related STEM fields."
Scientific Communication and Education,Probing visual literacy skills reveals student conceptions of scale and abstraction with respect to chromosomes,"Crystal,Dina L.,L. Kate,Crystal,Dina L.,L. Kate,Crystal,Dina L.","Molecular biology can be difficult for undergraduate students because course content is often taught using highly-abstract visual representations. Genetic concepts can be depicted with lines, letters, shapes, and symbols, and students need to engage their visual literacy skills to appropriately decipher these abstract representations. We previously found that undergraduate course materials almost always represent chromosomes in abstract forms, such as “X” shapes or straight lines with a dot for the centromere. We hypothesized that students struggle to apply their visual literacy skills to accurately interpret these abstract representations of chromosomes, which may be related to the frequently-documented incomplete or incorrect ideas students have about chromosome structure and function. To explore students’ visual literacy related to representations of chromosomes, we conducted 35 semi-structured interviews with students who had taken at least a year of biology courses. We asked them to sketch chromosomes, interpret an abstract representation of chromosomes, and use the abstract representation to answer a question about meiosis. We found that 97% of participants (34 of 35) held conceptual errors related to chromosome structure and function. These conceptual errors were often not evident in participants’ verbal definitions of chromosomes and were only revealed in their sketches or explanations of their sketches. We found that participants frequently misinterpreted X-shaped representations of chromosomes, mistook unreplicated homologous chromosomes as separated sister chromatids, and held misconceptions related to the structure and function of centromeres. These findings have implications for how chromosomes are taught in biology courses. We recommend that instructors explicitly discuss the conventions and norms of representing chromosomes as a pathway for increasing students’ visual literacy in molecular biology."

The drawings heavily relies on the task, so the ecological validity of the conclusions is low; 2. The subjective interpretation of drawings is inevitable. To address these problems, this study uses the Large Language Model (LLM) to identify the drawing contents of 1096 children’s scientific drawings (covering 6 scientific concepts), and uses the word2vec algorithm to calculate their semantic similarity. The study explores whether there are consistent drawing representations among children with the same theme, and attempts to establish a norm for children’s scientific drawings, providing a baseline reference for following children’s drawing research. The results showed that there were significant differences in the consistency of children’s representations of different concepts, and there was a possibility of consistency bias, that is, the appearance of consistency representations misled LLM. At the same time, linear regression tests were used to analyze the relevant factors that affect children’s representation. The results show that sample size and teaching strategies can affect the accuracy of LLM’s image recognition, while the degree of conceptual abstraction may affect the consistency of representation."

Ann,Tom,Emily A.,Austin M.,Shubham,L. Ann,Tom,Emily A.,Austin M.,Shubham,L. Ann","Harsh environments, such as those with breaking waves and turbulent flows, present extreme challenges to organismal survival. Many animals exploiting these habitats possess adaptations to maintain position under dynamic flow conditions, such as reversible or permanent attachment systems. However, some station-holding fishes (e.g., sculpins) instead rely on morphological and behavioral modifications of their pectoral fins to increase friction with the substrate and combat drag. Despite epidermal microstructures on the fins of other benthic fishes, little exploration of pectoral fin surfaces at the microscopic scale has been undertaken in sculpins. Using scanning electron microscopy, we discovered microscopic, fibrillar projections contained within single cells on the ventral surfaces of the paired fin rays of two intertidal and two subtidal species of marine sculpins. In contrast to subtidal species, the intertidal species possessed epidermal cells with discrete channels separating groups of fibrillar projections. These features bear a striking resemblance to epidermal microstructures described in other fishes but have distinct morphological differences. We posit that these previously overlooked features likely contribute to sculpin station-holding performance via enhanced mechanical interactions with the substrate, suggesting new taxa within which to examine mechanisms of underwater friction enhancement and adhesion."

The total diversity of geographic radiations of many Indo-Pacific fauna is often incompletely sampled in phylogenetic studies due to the difficulty in obtaining single island endemic forms across the Pacific and the relatively poor performance of degraded DNA when using museum specimens for inference of evolutionary relationships. New methods for production and analysis of genome-wide datasets sourced from degraded DNA are facilitating insights into the complex evolutionary histories of these influential island faunas. Here, we leverage whole genome resequencing (20X average coverage) and extensive sampling of all taxonomic diversity within , kingfishers, a rapid radiation of largely island endemic ‘Great Speciators.’ We find that whole genome datasets do not outright resolve the evolutionary relationships of this clade: four types of molecular markers (UCEs, BUSCOs, SNPs, and mtDNA) and tree building methods did not find a single well-supported and concordant species-level topology. We then uncover evidence of widespread incomplete lineage sorting and both ancient and contemporary gene flow and demonstrate how these factors contribute to conflicting evolutionary histories. Our complete taxonomic sampling allowed us to further identify a novel case of mitochondrial capture between two allopatric species, suggesting a potential historical (but since lost) hybrid zone as islands were successively colonized. Taken together, these results highlight how increased genomic and taxon sampling can reveal complex evolutionary patterns in rapid island radiations."

In experiment II, changes in polyp extension were measured following a simulated predator cue for both shaded and un-shaded colonies. Experiment I demonstrates that , possesses a mechanism for detecting changes in light intensity and responds by manipulating the extension of its polyps. Following polyp retraction due to a predator cue in experiment II, the temporal pattern of polyp re-extension differed between shaded and non-shaded colonies, and at the end of the observation period, shaded colonies had a greater proportion of extended polyps than non-shaded colonies, consistent with the results of experiment I.

Moringa oleifera seeds were defatted using solvent and used in formulating diets for PEM-induced Wistar rats. The study analyzed the seeds' phytochemical constituents, proximate composition, amino acid profiles, and bioactive compounds through Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS). 20 Rats were randomly assigned to four groups: A=control, B= PEM, C= malnourished rats treated with 15% soya bean based-diet and D= malnourished rats  treated with 15% defatted Moringa oleifera seed-based diet. The results show that defatting increased protein content and reduced anti-nutritional factors like oxalates, saponins, and tannins, enhancing nutrient bioavailability. Defatted Moringa oleifera seed-based diets improved liver and kidney functions, lipid profiles, and protein digestibility in protein energy malnutrition-induced rats. Additionally, the seeds contained essential bioactive compounds with potential antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. These findings suggest that Moringa oleifera seeds could be a promising alternative protein source for combating protein energy malnutrition"
Zoology,Optimization of rearing ,"Hung,Binh,Bishwo,Maciej,Hung,Binh,Bishwo,Maciej,Hung,Binh,Bishwo","The global application of , (Acari: Phytoseiidae) as a biological control agent across various protected crops has proven effective against a range of insect pests like thrips and whiteflies, as well as pest mites like broad mites and russet mites. Optimization of rearing , under laboratory conditions is crucial for further studies of this species to improve their application in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs. Here, we evaluated the development and reproduction of , when fed on four different diets, including cattail pollen (,), living dried fruit mites (,), frozen , eggs, and a mixed diet of frozen , eggs and , pollen. Females consuming the mixed diet exhibited superior total fecundity and daily oviposition rate, along with the highest intrinsic rate of increase (r,) and net productive rate (R,) among all diets tested. The immature period was significantly longer for mites on a diet of living , compared to those on other diets. Importantly, utilizing frozen , eggs and , pollen mitigates the risk of infestation and contamination from the living dried fruit mites, which is important for laboratory and field settings when releasing the predator colonies. Our findings not only present an optimized rearing method for predatory mites under laboratory conditions but also suggest potential broader applications for enhancing the effectiveness and sustainability of biological control strategies across various agroecosystems and reducing dependency on chemical pesticides."
Plant Biology,Highly expressed cell wall genes contribute to robustness of sepal size,"Diego A,Mathilde,Nelly,Françoise,Arezki A,Diego A,Mathilde,Nelly,Françoise,Arezki A,Diego A,Mathilde,Nelly,Françoise","Reproducibility in organ size and shape is a fascinating trait of living organisms. The mechanisms underlying such robustness remain, however, to be elucidated. Taking the sepal of Arabidopsis as a model, we investigated whether variability of gene expression plays a role in variation of organ morphology. Previous work from our team identified cell-wall related genes as being enriched among the genes whose expression is highly variable. We then hypothesized that the variation of measured morphological parameters in cell-wall related single knockout mutants could be correlated with the variation in gene expression of the corresponding gene (the knocked-out gene) in wild-type plants. We analyzed sepal morphology from 16 cell-wall mutants and found that, unexpectedly, the higher a gene is expressed in wild type, the more variable the size of the corresponding mutant. These findings support a contribution of cell-wall related genes to the robustness of sepal size."

Severe outbreaks of the grey pineapple mealybug, , Beardsley (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), have been observed in several villages of the Pune district, Maharashtra (India), since 2021, leading to significant economic losses. This report provides an illustrative morphological diagnosis of , and basic information on its field establishment, impact on tuberose crops, nature of the damage and field symptoms etc. Surveys conducted in major tuberose-growing areas of Pune district (Maharashtra) revealed that the mealybug primarily infests the underground and basal portion of tuberose plants, causing stunted growth, drooping, and ultimately death of the plants. , produces honeydew, fostering sooty mold growth that impairs photosynthesis, reduces flower yield. It also infests tuberose bulbs, spoiling them in storage. Based on primary scientific literature, this study represents the first scientifically confirmed record of , as a new pest of tuberose in India. The ant species , was found attending to mealybug colonies, aiding their spread and creating a nuisance for farmers during routine field activities. A total of 87.09% of the surveyed fields (n=62) showed mealybug infestation, ranging from 68% to 97%. Raising awareness among the farmers and implementing regular monitoring in tuberose-growing areas are crucial steps for developing effective management practices and preventing the further spread of this pest to other regions."

Plant Biology,"Stabilization of HSA32, an aggregation-prone protein, by the protein disaggregase HSP101 plays a critical role in maintaining acquired thermotolerance in Arabidopsis","Suma,Shih-Jiun,Nai-Yu,Chuan-Chih,Hong-Yi,Akankshita,Yu-Yen,Yang-Hsin,Hongyong,Yee-yung,Suma,Shih-Jiun,Nai-Yu,Chuan-Chih,Hong-Yi,Akankshita,Yu-Yen,Yang-Hsin,Hongyong,Yee-yung,Suma,Shih-Jiun,Nai-Yu,Chuan-Chih,Hong-Yi,Akankshita,Yu-Yen,Yang-Hsin,Hongyong","Heat acclimation confers acquired thermotolerance (AT), and heat-acclimation memory (HAM) is the maintenance of AT for some time. In Arabidopsis and rice, the heat-stress-associated 32-kDa protein (HSA32) and the protein disaggregase heat shock protein101 (HSP101) form a positive feedback loop at the protein level to maintain AT; HSA32 mitigates HSP101 degradation, and HSP101 positively regulates the accumulation of HSA32. Here, we report the underpinning mechanism regarding how HSP101 affects the HSA32 level in Arabidopsis. We found that, without HSP101, nascent HSA32 was rapidly degraded, and the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, inhibited the degradation. In response to heat stress, the nascent HSA32-GFP fusion protein was present in liquid condensates and diffused in the cytosol after returning to non-stress temperature. Proximity labeling with HSA32-TurboID identified HSP101 and five other protein chaperones and co-chaperones as the primary interactors. Disturbing the interaction between HSA32 and HSP101 destabilized HSA32 and compromised HAM. HSA32 is predicted as a TIM-barrel protein with three intrinsically disordered regions of high aggregation propensity. Recombinant HSA32 expressed in E. coli was partitioned into insoluble fractions, suggesting that HSA32 is aggregation-prone. Our findings highlight how the interplay between an aggregation-prone protein and a protein disaggregase can maintain plant stress memory."
Plant Biology,Cis-regulatory mutations co-opting circadian clock regulation underlie naturally selected extreme trait in Arabidopsis halleri,"Leonardo,Justyna,Cecile,Julien,Marc,Ute,Leonardo,Justyna,Cecile,Julien,Marc,Ute,Leonardo,Justyna,Cecile,Julien,Marc","HEAVY METAL ATPase 4 (HMA4) is required for the naturally selected traits of zinc/cadmium hyperaccumulation and hypertolerance of in Arabidopsis halleri. Cis-regulatory alterations and tandem triplication of AhHMA4 result in substantially elevated transcript levels compared to the closely related non-tolerant non-hyperaccumulator Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we identify cis-regulatory Metal Hyperaccumulation Elements (MHEs) necessary for AhHMA4 promoter activity, employing sequence comparisons and motif elicitation analyses combined with progressive deletions and site-directed mutagenesis of promoter-reporter constructs. We report that the promoters of all AhHMA4 gene copies share a distal MHE1 (consensus TGTAAC), and a proximal pair of MHE2s identical or highly similar to the Evening Element (AAAATATCT). Evening elements are known binding sites of Arabidopsis CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1), a phytochrome-regulated transcription factor in the core circadian clock. We show that the promoter of each AhHMA4 gene copy, but not of AtHMA4, mediates enhanced transcript levels of the reporter and their diel rhythmicity. These functional characteristics are CCA1-dependent and recapitulated by a synthetic reporter construct placing the MHE2 pair into the AtHMA4-promoter sequence context, according to the example of the AhHMA4-1 promoter. Consistent with our observations in transgenic reporter lines, AhHMA4 transcript levels follow a diel rhythm in wild-type A. halleri plants. Different from A. halleri, we identify complex repressive functionalities co-localizing with an upstream lncRNA and an intron in the 5′ untranslated region of A. thaliana HMA4. In summary, our work exemplifies how cis-regulatory mutations contributed to the evolution of extreme physiological traits through the co-option of the circadian clock regulatory network."

This study aims at deciphering the genetic architecture underlying resistance or tolerance across environments for major pests and diseases in peach (P. persica) and apricot (P. armeniaca). We set up a multi-environment trial (MET) approach by studying two core collections of 206 peach and 150 apricot accessions deployed under low phytosanitary conditions in respectively three and two environmentally contrasted locations in South-East of France. To capture the complex dynamics of pest and disease spread in naturally infected orchards, visual scoring of symptoms was repeated within and between 3 years, for five and two pests and diseases respectively for peach and apricot, resulting in the maximum of damage score and the AUDPC. These traits were used as phenotypic inputs in our genome-wide association studies (GWAS) strategy, and leading to the identification of: i) non-additive genotype–phenotype associations, ii) environment-shared QTLs iii) environment-specific QTLs, and iv) interactive QTLs which changes in direction (""antagonist"") or intensity (""differential"") according to the environment. By conducting GWAS with multiple methods, we successfully identified a total of 60 high confidence QTLs, leading to the identification of 87 candidate genes, the majority belonging to the Leucine-rich repeat containing receptors (LRR-CRs) family gene. Finally, we provided a comparative analysis of our results on peach and apricot, two closely related species.

To examine this dogma, we measured fluorescence induction at 77K at 690 nm (PSII) and 760 nm (mainly PSI) in the leaf discs of Spinacia oleracea, Cucumis sativus and shade tolerant Alocasia odora, grown at high and low light, and quantified their spillover capacities. PSI fluorescence (FI) consists of the intrinsic PSI fluorescence (FIα) and fluorescence caused by excitations spilt over from PSII (FIβ). When FI and FII parameters between State 1 and State 2, induced by weak far-red and blue light, were compared, PSII maximum fluorescence (FIIm) and FIβ were greater, and FIα was smaller in State 1 and thereby the spillover ratio, FIβ/(FIα+FIβ) or FIβ/FIm, was greater in State 1. Since the leftover FIIm was found to be about 10% of total Fm at 760 nm, all the data were corrected. Even after the correction, the spillover ratio in FIm in State 1 ranged from 21 to 32%, and the spillover ratios were comparable irrespective of growth light conditions. Although extensive grana in low light grown plants would suggest that PSII and PSI are too separated for spillover, in A. odora chloroplasts, the ratio of non-appressed thylakoid membranes/total thylakoid membranes was little affected by growth light and more than 40%.  Abundant non-appressed thylakoids would contribute to efficient spillover."

However, the regulatory basis of this integration on increased environmental adaptability in allohexaploid remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the change of transcriptome, epigenome as well as the chromatin interactome, and metabolome in three independent polyploidization events representing DD genome integration. Our findings reveal that polyploidization events induce the activation of defense-related genes through comprehensive reorganization of epigenome and chromatin architecture. DD integration not only brings an additional gene copy but also activates the homoeologs existing in the A and B subgenomes through chromatin interactions. Furthermore, secondary metabolites represented by alkaloids and flavonoids that are crucial for environmental adaptation, are significantly enriched following polyploidization. Thus, hexaploid wheat exhibits enhanced tolerance to alkalinity, UV-B light stress and high salt conditions was observed. These results highlight the indispensable role of DD genome integration in the adaptability of allohexaploid wheat during its evolution."
Plant Biology,Alternatives to photorespiration: A systems-level analysis reveals mechanisms of enhanced plant productivity,"Edward N.,Marvin,Andreas P.M.,Oliver,Matthias,Edward N.,Marvin,Andreas P.M.,Oliver,Matthias,Edward N.,Marvin,Andreas P.M.,Oliver",Photorespiration causes a significant decrease in crop yield due to mitochondrial decarboxylation. Alternative pathways (APs) have been designed to relocate the decarboxylating step or even fix additional carbon. To improve the success of transferring those engineered APs from model species to crops we must understand how they will interact with metabolism and how the plant physiology affects their performance. Here we used multiple mathematical modelling techniques to analyse and compare existing AP designs. We show that carbon-fixing APs are the most promising candidates to replace native photorespiration in major crop species. Our results demonstrate the different metabolic routes that APs employ to increase yield and which plant physiology can profit most from them. We anticipate our results to guide the design of new APs and to help improve existing ones.
Plant Biology,"The role of auxin-mediated gene activation in the bryophyte, Physcomitrium patens","Carlisle S,Daniella,Mark,Carlisle S,Daniella,Mark,Carlisle S,Daniella","Perception and response to the hormone auxin is critical to plant growth and development. Expression of auxin-response genes is tightly regulated via known mechanisms of both activation and repression. Across the plant lineage, auxin-response gene induction is performed by AUXIN-REPSONSE FACTOR (ARF) activating transcription factors. Conversely, AUXIN/INDOLE ACETIC ACID proteins repress expression. Studies of gain-of-function constitutive-repression lines and ARF loss-of-function mutants have advanced the field. Yet, there is a need for a comparative study of aberrant auxin-signaling mutants to understand the developmental consequences of constitutive repression versus the absence of auxin-mediated gene induction. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing tools, we mutated each activating ARF gene in the model bryophyte, Physcomitrium patens. The resulting septuple loss-of-function mutant line (arfasept) has severe developmental phenotypes and a diminished ability to respond to exogenous auxin. However, phenotypic analysis revealed that the arfasept line is not as severely affected as the constitutive-repression lines. Expression analysis of several auxin-response genes demonstrate that auxin-mediated gene induction is abolished in both arfasept and constitutive-repression lines but that basal expression levels are higher in the arfasept lines. Our results suggest that the expression of auxin-regulated genes important for developmental progression is maintained, albeit at reduced levels, in the absence of ARFs."
Zoology,Sperm quality metrics exhibit annual fluctuations in a critically endangered amphibian managed under human care,"Allison R.,Isabella J.,Carrie K.,Diane,Allison R.,Isabella J.,Carrie K.,Diane,Allison R.,Isabella J.,Carrie K.","The Puerto Rican crested toad (PRCT) is Puerto Rico’s only endemic toad and has undergone rapid population decline within the last 40 years. As a hedge against extinction, captive assurance colonies have been established at several zoological institutions for breeding and reintroduction. However, reproductive output has remained low, despite the use of hormone therapies to attempt to bypass missing abiotic cues and stimulate reproductive behaviors. This low output necessitates a better understanding of natural fluctuations in gamete, specifically sperm, quality in captive individuals. To generate an understanding of natural gametic cycles in captive PRCTs, we administered male PRCTs (n = 86) housed under natural temperature and photoperiod cycles with exogenous hormones monthly for one year. Samples were analyzed for motility and concentration to assess variations in sperm quality by month. Spermiation was successfully stimulated every month, but quality fluctuated; sperm motility was highest in June and July, while sperm concentration was highest in December, January, and March. These results indicate that, while hormones can be utilized to stimulate gamete production in PRCTs year-round, sperm quality is not consistent. Furthermore, the seasonal occurrence of peak sperm production of captive males differed from natural peaks reported for wild PRCTs. Our results illustrate the need for more biologically informed strategies for breeding of at-risk anuran populations."
Plant Biology,The role of IAA and its transport in the complex streptophyte algae Chara braunii,"Katarina,Stanislav,Daniel,Karel,Petre,Vojtěch,Piotr,Andre,Adrijana,Tom James,Dolf,Jiří,John L,Jan,Katarina,Stanislav,Daniel,Karel,Petre,Vojtěch,Piotr,Andre,Adrijana,Tom James,Dolf,Jiří,John L,Jan,Katarina,Stanislav,Daniel,Karel,Petre,Vojtěch,Piotr,Andre,Adrijana,Tom James,Dolf,Jiří,John L","The role of auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a phytohormone with numerous morphogenic functions, is now well-established in land plants. Although the role of IAA and its transport in algae remains unclear, PIN-driven auxin export is probably an ancient and conserved trait within Streptophytes. Among streptophyte algae, Chara represents a genus with a considerable degree of complexity in body arrangement. This study investigates the auxin response and characterizes homologs of land plant PIN auxin efflux carriers in Chara braunii. Through  regeneration experiments, we observed that IAA significantly promotes elongation of thallus and side branch development upon thallus tip decapitation, indicating an effect on morphogenesis. We show that IAA is actively uptaken and metabolized by thallus cells and that this process is influenced by N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA). To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we cloned and sequenced the most expressed Chara braunii PINs, CbPINa and CbPINc. Using epitope-specific antibodies, we showed their presence in the plasma membrane (PM) of vegetative internodal cells and generative antheridial cells. Functional tests in tobacco BY-2 cells, supported by in silico docking of IAA and NPA to CbPINa and CbPINc, showed that PM-localized CbPINa interferes with auxin transport in contrast to ER-localized CbPINc. Finally, our phosphoproteome analysis indicated that IAA rapidly induces specific phosphorylation events, including RAF-like kinase phosphorylation, highlighting a potential role for IAA in fast signaling processes in Chara braunii. Altogether, we provide new insights into IAA role in Chara braunii morphogenesis and suggest that while the canonical auxin transport mechanism may not be conserved, auxin still may likely play a role in rapid signaling pathways in this close relative of land plants."

Yet, these disciplinary literacy skills and professional practices are often part of the hidden curriculum of science research, thus excluding students and others from fully understanding ways in which scientific knowledge is constructed, refined, and disseminated even though students are participating in such activities. Secondary students are increasingly involved in scientific research projects that include authentic disciplinary literacy components such as research proposals, posters, videos, and scientific research papers. More and more, students are also engaging in professional practice of publishing their scientific research papers through dedicated secondary science journals. How teachers and other mentors support the development of professional disciplinary literacies in students is critical to understand as part of supporting more student participation in research. To this end, we used a mixed- methods study of interviews and surveys to examine the experience and conceptions of the mentors (teachers and professional scientists) who guided pre-college students through the writing and publication of their scientific research projects. Analyzing our data from a lens of cognitive apprenticeship, we find that mentors encourage independence by primarily employing the method of “exploration”. We also find that mentors have divergent views on the value of publication within science, versus for student scientists specifically. Our findings suggest that mentors could work to explicitly reveal their own thinking within science writing to provide more sequenced support for student scientists."

In plants, cell to cell mobility of transcription factors has emerged as a key paradigm. For the shoot apical meristem of the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana it has been described that the translocation of the WUSCHEL homeodomain transcription factor from niche cells to stem cells is essential for their maintenance. Here we systematically investigate the function of diverse WUS alleles and leverage multispectral live cell imaging coupled to computational analysis and mechanistic mathematical modelling to show that WUSCHEL protein mobility is the result of balance between active transport and retention in niche cells and likely independent of the stem cell signal CLAVATA3. Importantly, we show that diffusion across cell layers of the meristem is not symmetrical, suggesting that there is unexpected complexity in cellular connections."

The highly selected genes revealed after two rounds of screens included the previously reported KIAA039L, TM9SF2, and RNF121, along with a cluster of genes involved in glycan biogenesis, Golgi apparatus localization and endoplasmic reticulum penetration. In this report, we focused on solute carrier family 35 member A1 (SLC35A1), a Golgi apparatus-localized cytidine 5'-monophosphate-sialic acid (CMP-SIA) transporter. We confirmed that SLC35A1 knockout (KO) significantly decreased rAAV5 transduction to a level lower than that observed in KIAA0319L or TM9SF2 KO cells. Although SLC35A1 KO drastically reduced the expression of α2,6-linked SIA on the cell surface, the expression of α2,3-linked SIA, as well as the cell binding and internalization of rAAV5, were only moderately affected. Moreover, SLC35A1 KO significantly diminished the transduction of AAV multi-serotypes, including rAAV2 and rAAV3 which do not utilize SIAs for primary attachment. Notably, the SLC35A1 KO markedly increased transduction of rAAV9 and rAAV11, which primarily attach to cells via binding to galactose. Further analyses revealed that SLC35A1 KO significantly decreased vector nuclear import. More importantly, although the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail deletion (∆C Tail) mutant of SLC35A1 did not drastically decrease SIA expression, it significantly decreased rAAV transduction, as well as vector nuclear import, suggesting the C-tail is critical in these processes. Furthermore, the T128A mutant significantly decreased SIA expression, but still supported rAAV transduction and nuclear import. These findings highlight the involvement of the CMP-SIA transporter in the intracellular trafficking of rAAV vectors post-internalization."

In this study, tropical sheep (Doyogena rams) and goats (Woyito-Guji bucks) fed diets containing different amounts of WH were examined for their zoo-technical performance and profitability sing a 2 × 4 × 4 randomized crossover design with two animal species, four nutritional treatments, and four feeding intervals. The dietary treatments consisted of 50% hay + 0% WH + 50% commercial concentrate (CC, T1), 50% hay + 12.5% WH + 37.5% CC (T2), 50% hay + 25% WH + 25% CC (T3), and 50% hay + 37.5% WH + 12.5% CC (T4). The findings showed that compared to goats, sheep had the highest energy and nutrient intake (P<0.001), nutrient digestibility (P<0.001), average daily gain (ADG, g/day), and body weight change (BWC (kg) (P<0.05). Regarding energy and nutritional intake, there was a substantial difference (P < 0.001) between treatment groups for both animal species, with the exception of goats’ consumption of DM, OM, CHO, GE, and ADL (P <0.05). Likewise, significant differences existed between treatment groups for nutritional digestibility, ADG, BWC, and FCE for both species (P <0.001). Moreover, significant interactions (P < 0.005) were seen in all energy and nutrient intake parameters between species and treatment. Furthermore, in tropical sheep and goat breeds, water hyacinth can replace up to 37.5% of the commercial concentrate used for growth and fattening, but it has a major comparative effect on sheep. Feed prices for the T4 group fed sheep and goats were 37.2% and 36.8% lower, respectively, than for the T1 group. Therefore, farmers in the tropics who cannot afford commercial concentrates can still benefit economically by using the dry biomass of water hyacinth in their diet, either with or without it."
Plant Biology,Identification and Expression of the peach TNL RMia genes for the Resistance to the Root-knot Nematode Meloidogyne incognita,"Henri,Laure,Naima,Claire,Caroline,Cyril,Henri,Laure,Naima,Claire,Caroline,Cyril,Henri,Laure,Naima,Claire,Caroline","Root-Knot Nematodes (RKN) are major pests for world agriculture. As RKN are polyphagous endoparasites, present in various climates and able to multiply rapidly, the quest to discover new natural resistances in plants is essential. In Prunus species, several major resistance genes to RKN that belong to the NLR family, have been detected in recent years. In Peach, the RMia gene, which confers resistance to the RKN Meloidogyne incognita, M. arenaria, and M. ethiopica, was localized on the chromosome 2. In this study, we used short- and long-read sequencing technologies to identify the RMia gene in two independent RKN-resistant peach varieties. We characterized three candidate genes and studied their expression profile upon RKN infection. Our study identified and characterized these candidates that are most likely involved in the RKN resistance. Ultimately, we developed new molecular markers associated to this resistance that can be used in breeding programs."
Synthetic Biology,Light-guided actin polymerization drives directed motility in protocells,"HIdeaki T.,Shiva,T. Willow,Daichi,Hideki,Daniel A.,Tomoaki,Baoyu,Satoshi,Shin-ichiro M.,Takanari,HIdeaki T.,Shiva,T. Willow,Daichi,Hideki,Daniel A.,Tomoaki,Baoyu,Satoshi,Shin-ichiro M.,Takanari,HIdeaki T.,Shiva,T. Willow,Daichi,Hideki,Daniel A.,Tomoaki,Baoyu,Satoshi,Shin-ichiro M.","Motility is a hallmark of life′s dynamic processes, enabling cells to actively chase prey, repair wounds, and shape organs. Recreating these intricate behaviors using well-defined molecules remains a major challenge at the intersection of biology, physics, and molecular engineering. Although the polymerization force of the actin cytoskeleton is characterized as a primary driver of cell motility, recapitulating this process in protocellular systems has proven elusive. The difficulty lies in the daunting task of distilling key components from motile cells and integrating them into model membranes in a physiologically relevant manner. To address this, we developed a method to optically control actin polymerization with high spatiotemporal precision within cell-mimetic lipid vesicles known as giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Within these active protocells, the reorganization of actin networks triggered outward membrane extensions as well as the unidirectional movement of GUVs at speeds of up to 0.43 μm/min, comparable to typical adherent mammalian cells. Notably, our findings reveal a synergistic interplay between branched and linear actin forms in promoting membrane protrusions, highlighting the cooperative nature of these cytoskeletal elements. This approach offers a powerful platform for unraveling the intricacies of cell migration, designing synthetic cells with active morphodynamics, and advancing bioengineering applications, such as self-propelled delivery systems and autonomous tissue-like materials."
Microbiology,Enhancing pigment production by a chromogenic bacterium (Exiguobacterium aurantiacum) using tomato waste extract: A Statistical approach,"Birhanu,Diriba,Hunduma  Ababa,Dereje  Ababa,Jemal,Birhanu,Diriba,Hunduma  Ababa,Dereje  Ababa,Jemal,Birhanu,Diriba,Hunduma  Ababa,Dereje  Ababa","There is high demand for microbial pigments as promising alternative for synthetic pigments basically for safety and economic reasons. This study aimed at the optimization of yellowish-orange pigment production by Exiguobacterium aurantiacum using agro-waste extract as growth substrate. Air samples were collected using depositional method. Pure cultures of pigment producing bacteria were isolated by subsequent culturing on fresh nutrient agar medium and the potent isolate was identified using MALDI-TOF technique. Culture conditions were screened using Plackett-Burman design and the most three significant variables were optimized by response surface methodology. Fermentation was conducted in 150 mL agro-waste decoctions from which tomato waste extract was selected because of higher optical density of the culture compared to other agro-waste extracts. Pigment was extracted by solvent extraction method and the best solvent was selected based on its ability to dissolve the culture suspension. The pigment was characterized using spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques. Culture agitation rate, initial medium pH and concentration of yeast extract were identified as the most significant (p< 0.0001) variables affecting pigment production. At optimized conditions, 0.96 g/L of pigment was extracted from 4.73 g/L of culture biomass and the extracted pigment under optimized conditions was 1.6 times higher than the pigment extracted under un-optimized conditions. The spectroscopic and chromatographic analyses demonstrated the presence of different functional groups and carotenoids were identified as parts of the molecule responsible for the yellowish-orange pigmentation of the extract. This study demonstrated the potential for optimization of pigment production by bacteria using agro-waste extract as substrate. Hence, the current findings strongly encourage for further study at a large-scale level for industrial production."
Microbiology,SMC modulates ParB engagement in segregation complexes in Streptomyces,"Katarzyna,Agnieszka,Michal,Julia,Marcin,Dagmara,Katarzyna,Agnieszka,Michal,Julia,Marcin,Dagmara,Katarzyna,Agnieszka,Michal,Julia,Marcin","ParB is long established chromosome segregation protein in bacteria. Due to the recently demonstrated CTPase activity of ParB, formation of its nucleoprotein complexes was unrevealed. ParB homodimers bound to CTP are loaded onto DNA at parS sites, where they recruit condensin (SMC), thereby facilitating chromosome organization and segregation. Whether SMC modulates ParB complexes has remained unknown. Here, we generated Streptomyces venezuelae strains producing ParB-HaloTag in the presence or absence of SMC and used single-cell time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, single molecule tracking and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis to explore ParB dynamics. Additionally, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation to examine ParB interactions with DNA in the presence or absence of SMC. We reveal that SMC modulates ParB complex stability on DNA. We find that the absence of SMC results in faster ParB complex disassembly, and promotes non-specific DNA binding. Additionally, we show that SMC reduces ParB CTPase activity in vitro. Taken together our data provide evidence of SMC positive feedback on the ParB nucleoprotein complex, offering new insight into the nature of ParB complex regulation."
Plant Biology,Plant phenotypic differentiation outweighs genetic variation in shaping the lettuce leaf microbiota,"Arianna,Guillaume,Alessandra,Piergiorgio,Tiziano,Andrea,Stephane,Marco,Arianna,Guillaume,Alessandra,Piergiorgio,Tiziano,Andrea,Stephane,Marco,Arianna,Guillaume,Alessandra,Piergiorgio,Tiziano,Andrea,Stephane","Lettuce is a widely consumed raw vegetable, making it crucial to understand and predict its leaf-associated microbial communities for the benefit of both plant and human health. While environmental factors are known to strongly influence plant leaf microbiomes, the role of plant-specific determinants in shaping microbial diversity remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the impact of three key plant factors -genetic distance, morphology and leaf micro- and macronutrient content- on the composition and diversity of lettuce leaf bacterial communities. Using 131 fully-sequenced Lactuca sativa genotypes, we analyzed their leaf-associated bacterial communities via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Our findings revealed that morphological classification, as defined by breeders, exerts a greater influence on bacterial community diversity than genetic distance or variations in leaf nutrient levels. Together with shoot traits they explained 13.9% of the observed bacterial diversity. Further analysis of 10 specific leaf morphological traits showed that heart formation, head height, and venation types significantly shaped bacterial richness and evenness, mainly acting on non-hub members. The strong association between leaf morphology and bacterial community structure suggests that phenotypic traits play a disproportionately large, yet understudied, role in leaf microbiota establishment offering new potential for manipulation by breeders."
Microbiology,Virological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 XEC variant,"Yu,Kaho,Shusuke,Keiya,Luo,Yusuke,Yoshifumi,MST Monira,Sharee,Terumasa,Kenji,Hiroyuki,Mami,Kazuhisa,Jumpei,Kei,Yu,Kaho,Shusuke,Keiya,Luo,Yusuke,Yoshifumi,MST Monira,Sharee,Terumasa,Kenji,Hiroyuki,Mami,Kazuhisa,Jumpei,Kei,Yu,Kaho,Shusuke,Keiya,Luo,Yusuke,Yoshifumi,MST Monira,Sharee,Terumasa,Kenji,Hiroyuki,Mami,Kazuhisa,Jumpei","The SARS-CoV-2 JN.1 variant (BA.2.86.1.1), arising from BA.2.86.1 with spike protein (S) substitution S:L455S, outcompeted the previously predominant XBB lineages by the beginning of 2024. Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future."
Microbiology,Myosin light chain 3 serves as a receptor for nervous necrosis virus entry into host cells via the macropinocytosis pathway,"Lan,Wanwan,Xiaogang,Meisheng,Kuntong,Lan,Wanwan,Xiaogang,Meisheng,Kuntong,Lan,Wanwan,Xiaogang,Meisheng","Nodaviridae infections cause severe mortality in insects and fish, with nervous necrosis virus (NNV) posing significant threats to global fish populations. However, the host factors involved in NNV entry remain poorly understood. Here, we identify myosin light chain 3 from marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) (MmMYL3) as a novel receptor for red-spotted grouper NNV (RGNNV), facilitating internalization via macropinocytosis. MmMYL3 directly binds the RGNNV capsid protein (CP), which dependents on the arm and S domains of CP and the EF-hand2 domain of MmMYL3. In vitro experiments showed that MmMYL3 siRNA, protein, anti-MYL3 antibodies or the arm domain synthetic peptides blocked RGNNV entry. Moreover, in vivo administration of MmMYL3 protein also inhibited RGNNV infection. Ectopic MmMYL3 expression enabled RGNNV internalization into resistant cells. Notably, MmMYL3 facilitated RGNNV internalization through the macropinocytosis pathway via the IGF1R-Rac1/Cdc42 axis. Collectively, our findings underscore MYL3's crucial role in NNV entry and its potential as an antiviral target."
Microbiology,A dissection of the genomic antimicrobial resistance epidemiology of Salmonella Typhimurium,"Sandeep,Michael,Sally R.,Vitali,Ruiting,Sandeep,Michael,Sally R.,Vitali,Ruiting,Sandeep,Michael,Sally R.,Vitali","Salmonella Typhimurium (STm) is a globally prevalent pathogen. We compiled a dataset comprising ~65,000 publicly available STm isolates and analysed the predicted-resistance to 15 key antibiotics. Additionally, we typed all isolates using a standardized typing method, multilevel genome typing (MGT), and characterised the resistance profiles by MGT sequence types (ST). We identified 407 MGT STs wherein at least 80% of the isolates were non-susceptible to at least one antibiotic. For the key antibiotics prescribed for severe salmonellosis, we identified three ciprofloxacin non-susceptible MGT STs, and eight cefotaxime non-susceptible MGT STs in the last two years of the dataset (2021-2022). While the ciprofloxacin non-susceptible MGT STs comprised isolates predominantly from the UK; only one cefotaxime non-susceptible MGT ST comprised isolates predominantly from UK and associated with swine, with others from USA, and associated with cattle and poultry. Integration of AMR predictions with MGT strain typing provides sharable, standardised, and specific identification and tracking of resistant isolates. This integrated analysis presents a unique approach for the global surveillance of antimicrobial resistance and resistant strains."
Microbiology,"Genomic and structural insights into Jyvaskylavirus, the first giant virus isolated from Finland","Gabriel Magno,Miika,Bruna Luiza,Jonatas S,Julien,Davide,Janne J,Iker,Nicola GA,Lotta-Riina,Gabriel Magno,Miika,Bruna Luiza,Jonatas S,Julien,Davide,Janne J,Iker,Nicola GA,Lotta-Riina,Gabriel Magno,Miika,Bruna Luiza,Jonatas S,Julien,Davide,Janne J,Iker,Nicola GA","Giant viruses of protists are a diverse and likely ubiquitous group of organisms. Here, we describe Jyvaskylavirus, the first giant virus isolated from Finland. This clade B marseillevirus was found in , from a composting soil sample in Jyväskylä, Central Finland. Its genome shares similarities with other marseilleviruses, including conserved Nucleocytoviricota genes, histone-like genes, and three unique ORFans. Helium ion microscopy and electron microscopy of infected cells unraveled stages of the Jyvaskylavirus lifecycle, such as single virions attached to the cell membrane, likely triggering endocytosis, and virus-rich vesicle formation within the cytoplasm. We also reconstructed the Jyvaskylavirus particle to 6.3 Å resolution using cryo-EM. The ~2,500 Å diameter virion displays structural similarities to other , giant viruses. The capsid comprises of 9,240 copies of the major capsid protein ORF184, which possesses a double jellyroll fold arranged in trimers forming pseudo-hexameric capsomers. Below the capsid shell, the internal membrane vesicle encloses the genome. Through cross-structural and -sequence comparisons with other , using AI-based software in model building and prediction, we elucidated ORF142 as the penton protein, which plugs the twelve vertices of the capsid. Five additional ORFs were identified, with models predicted and fitted into densities that either cap the capsomers externally or stabilize them internally. The isolation of Jyvaskylavirus, along with other virus-like particles, not only suggests that these viruses may be widespread in the boreal environment but also provide insights extendable to other marseilleviruses, addressing the previously lacking structural data on minor capsid proteins."

We quantified how diet influences microbiome dynamics in hospitalized patients. We recorded 9,419 meals consumed by 173 patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation and profiled the microbiome in 1,009 longitudinally collected stool samples from 158 of them. Caloric intake was correlated with fecal microbiota diversity. Bayesian inference revealed associations between intake of sweets or sugars during antibiotic exposure with microbiome disruption, as assessed by low diversity or expansion of the pathobiont Enterococcus. We validated this observation experimentally, finding that sucrose exacerbated antibiotic-induced Enterococcus expansion in mice. Taken together, our results suggest that avoiding sugar-rich foods during antibiotic treatment may reduce microbiome injury."
Microbiology,Altering the redox status of Chlamydia trachomatis directly impacts its developmental cycle progression,"Vandana,Scot P,Vandana,Scot P,Vandana","Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen with a unique developmental cycle. It differentiates between two functional and morphological forms: elementary body (EB) and reticulate body (RB). The signals that trigger differentiation from one form to the other are unknown. EBs and RBs have distinctive characteristics that distinguish them, including their size, infectivity, proteome, and transcriptome. Intriguingly, they also differ in their overall redox status as EBs are oxidized and RBs are reduced. We hypothesize that alterations in redox may serve as a trigger for secondary differentiation. To test this, we examined the function of the primary antioxidant enzyme alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (AhpC), a well-known member of the peroxiredoxins family, in chlamydial growth and development. Based on our hypothesis, we predicted that altering the expression of ahpC would modulate chlamydial redox status and trigger earlier or delayed secondary differentiation. To test this, we created ahpC overexpression and knockdown strains. During ahpC knockdown, ROS levels were elevated, and the bacteria were sensitive to a broad set of peroxide stresses. Interestingly, we observed increased expression of EB-associated genes and concurrent higher production of EBs at an earlier time in the developmental cycle, indicating earlier secondary differentiation occurs under elevated oxidation conditions. In contrast, overexpression of AhpC created a resistant phenotype against oxidizing agents and delayed secondary differentiation. Together, these results indicate that redox potential is a critical factor in developmental cycle progression. For the first time, our study provides a mechanism of chlamydial secondary differentiation dependent on redox status."
Microbiology,Blood cultures at baseline and during persistent candidemia contain populations of genetically diverse Candida albicans strains that may differ in echinocandin tolerance and virulence,"Giuseppe,Shaoji,Hassan,Chris L.,Josh,Darren,Eileen,Anthony,Binghua,Akila,Minh Hong,Cornelius J.,Giuseppe,Shaoji,Hassan,Chris L.,Josh,Darren,Eileen,Anthony,Binghua,Akila,Minh Hong,Cornelius J.,Giuseppe,Shaoji,Hassan,Chris L.,Josh,Darren,Eileen,Anthony,Binghua,Akila,Minh Hong","It is unknown whether within-patient Candida albicans diversity is common during bloodstream infections (BSIs). We determined whole genome sequences of 10 C. albicans strains from blood cultures (BCs) at baseline (n=4 patients) and during persistent BSIs (3 of 4 patients). BCs contained mixed populations of strains that differed by single nucleotide polymorphisms (n=4 patients), chromosome (Chr) 5 or 7 aneuploidy (n=2), and loss of heterozygosity (n=1). Chr7 trisomy (Tri7) strains from patient MN were attenuated for hyphal and biofilm formation in vitro compared to euploid strains, due to NRG1 over-expression. However, Tri7 strain M1 underwent filamentation during disseminated candidiasis (DC) in mice. M1 was more fit than euploid strain M2 during DC and gastrointestinal colonization/infection, and in blood ex vivo. M1 and M2 exhibited identical echinocandin minimum inhibitory concentrations, but M2 was more tolerant to micafungin in vitro. Furthermore, M2 was more competitive with M1 in mouse kidneys following micafungin treatment than it was in absence of micafungin. Tri7 strains represented 74% of patient MN’s baseline BC population, but after 1d and 3d of echinocandin treatment, euploid strains were 93% and 98% of the population, respectively. Findings suggest that echinocandin tolerant, euploid strains were a subpopulation to more virulent Tri7 strains at baseline and then selected upon echinocandin exposure. In conclusion, BCs in at least some patients are comprised of diverse C. albicans populations not recognized by the clinical lab, rather than single, genetically and phenotypically identical strains. Clinical relevance of C. albicans diversity and antifungal tolerance merits further investigation."

Rhesus macaques may be the best animal model to investigate these relationships given their spontaneous development of T2DM. We identified eight spontaneous T2DM macaques and conducted a comprehensive study investigating the relationships using multi-omics sequencing technology. Our results from 16S rRNA, metagenome, metabolome and transcriptome analyses identified that gut microbiota imbalance, tryptophan metabolism and fatty acid beta oxidation disorders, long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) accumulation, and inflammation occurred in T2DM macaques. We verified the accumulation of palmitic acid (PA) and activation of inflammation in T2DM macaques. Importantly, mice transplanted with spontaneous T2DM macaque fecal microbiota and fed a high PA diet developed prediabetes within 120 days. We determined that gut microbiota mediated the absorption of excess PA in the ileum, resulting in the accumulation of PA in the serum consequently leading to T2DM in mice. In particular, we demonstrated that the specific microbiota composition was probably involved in the process. This study provides new insight into interactions between microbiota and metabolites and confirms causative effect of gut microbiota on T2DM development."
Scientific Communication and Education,Anticipatory emotions and academic performance: The role of boredom in a preservice teachers’ lab experience,"Jesús A.,José María,Cristina,María Rocío,Jesús A.,José María,Cristina,María Rocío,Jesús A.,José María,Cristina","Affective experiences within academic contexts significantly influence educational outcomes. Despite this, the literature reveals a gap in generalising these effects to specific classroom activities, partly arising from the absence of suitable instruments to measure emotions in situational educational scenarios. Our study introduces an experience sampling method to measure sixteen discrete emotional states, deriving two scales for positive and negative activating emotions. Grounded in psychological and neuroscientific theories that integrate emotion with cognition, our research explores the interplay between prior knowledge, preservice teachers’ anticipatory situational emotions, and subsequent learning in an experimental science education context. Analysing data from 269 preservice teachers from diverse backgrounds (STEM and non-STEM) at the upper-secondary level, we found that negative activating emotions are often rooted in non-STEM backgrounds and exacerbated by limited prior science knowledge. These negative emotions impact achievement and learning primarily through the mediating role of boredom. Furthermore, our results indicate that the detrimental impact of boredom on achievement is significantly influenced by prior knowledge, with a more pronounced effect on students with lower levels. Given that emotions are amenable to intervention, our findings propose that specifically addressing boredom in students with low prior knowledge could amplify the benefits of educational strategies."

Recent reports show that it is spreading westwards, through Central Asia into Europe. Several field and laboratory methods have been proposed to detect , spp. in , colonies; however, most of them are either laborious, costly or ineffective. Here we introduce a novel method for detecting , based on the mite’s characteristic biology (reduced feeding as bee pupae mature, brief dispersal phase on adult bees and agility) and the use of wax strips. Sealed worker brood cells at the development stage of white to purple-eyed pupae are swiftly decapped with wax strips to observe and count surfacing adult mites. Our study shows over 90 % detection efficacy and brood survival, and ease of application. Therefore, we recommend the novel “Rapid brood decapping” method as a reliable tool for detecting and monitoring , infestation."

As an inhibitor, Trim7 overexpression ubiquitinates viral proteins by recognizing C-terminal glutamines that are hallmarks of 3C-like protease cleavage events. Here we sought to determine the physiological impact of Trim7 in resolving murine norovirus (MNV) infection of mice as MNV is potently inhibited by Trim7 in vitro. Utilizing two independently derived Trim7 deficient mouse lines we found no changes in the viral burden or tissue distribution of MNV in both an acute and persistent model of infection. Additionally, no changes in cytokine responses were observed after acute MNV infection of Trim7-deficient mice. Furthermore, removal of potentially confounding innate immune responses such as STING and STAT1 did not reveal any role for Trim7 in regulating MNV replication. Taken together, our data fails to find a physiological role for Trim7 in regulating MNV infection outcomes in mice and serves as a caution for defining Trim7 as a broad acting antiviral."

Plant Biology,Male and female gametophytes meet after winter: Testing the overwintering hypothesis for delayed fertilization in Japanese stone oak,"Takenori,Kota,Masahiro M,Akiko,Takenori,Kota,Masahiro M,Akiko,Takenori,Kota,Masahiro M","Fertilization delays of nearly a year have been observed in many acorn-producing Fagaceae trees. Despite this long-standing recognition, the underlying mechanisms and adaptive significance of delayed fertilization remain largely unexplored. It has been hypothesized that these prolonged delays may serve as an adaptive strategy, allowing ovules to be fertilized and seeds to develop during more favorable seasons, thereby avoiding the adverse conditions of winter. However, empirical evidence to support this hypothesis is still lacking. To test the overwintering hypothesis, we observed the seasonal progression of pollen tube growth and ovule development in Lithocarpus edulis, a species exhibiting two flowering seasons, spring and autumn. We conducted monthly observations of pollen tube growth and ovule development in both spring and autumn flower samples. We employed microtome techniques and scanning confocal microscopy to closely examine the seasonal progression of pollen tube growth and ovule development. We found that pollen tubes were arrested at the style-joining site, and ovules remained immature in both spring and autumn samples prior to winter. Following winter, pollen tube regrowth and ovule maturation were synchronized in the subsequent spring in both spring and autumn samples. Our results support the overwintering hypothesis, suggesting that delayed fertilization may serve as an adaptive strategy to ensure fertilization in spring, overcoming the reproductive challenges posed by cold winter conditions. Our study introduces a new avenue for studying the temporal organization of plant reproductive phenology, specifically the alignment of flowering, pollination, fertilization, and fruiting in seasonal environments."
Synthetic Biology,Further characterization and engineering of a 11-amino acid motif for enhancing recombinant protein expression,"Jiawu,Elaine,Weibiao,Fong Tian,Jiawu,Elaine,Weibiao,Fong Tian,Jiawu,Elaine,Weibiao","Background: Recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a widely used system in both academic and industrial research owing to its low cost and wide availability of genetic tools. Despite its advantages, this system still struggles with soluble expression of recombinant proteins. To address this, various solubility-enhancing and yield-improving methods such as the addition of fusion tags have been developed. However, traditional tags such as small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) and Glutathione S-transferase (GST) can interfere with protein folding or require removal post-translation, which adds complexity and cost to production. To circumvent these issues, smaller solubility tags (<10 kDa) are preferred. This study specifically focuses on an 11-amino acid solubility-enhancing tag (NT11) derived from the N-terminal domain of a duplicated carbonic anhydrase from Dunaliella species. Results: A comprehensive analysis was performed to improve the characteristics of the 11-amino acid tag. By investigating the alanine-scan library of NT11, we increased its activity and identified key residues for further development. Screening with the alanine mutant library consistently led to at least a two-fold improvement in protein yield for three different proteins. We also discovered that the NT11 tag is not limited to the N-terminal position and can function at either the N- or C-terminal of the protein, providing flexibility in designing protein expression constructs. With these new insights, we have successfully doubled the recombinant protein yields of valuable growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and an originally low-yielding human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), in E. coli. Conclusion: The further characterisation and development of the NT11 tag have provided valuable insights into the optimization process for such small tags and expanded our understanding of its potential applications.

Collectively, these findings have the potential to simplify and enhance the efficiency of recombinant protein production."
Scientific Communication and Education,Artificial Intelligence’s Contribution to Biomedical Literature Search: Revolutionizing or Complicating?,"Rui,Young Joo,Alexander G.,Vinit B.,Rui,Young Joo,Alexander G.,Vinit B.,Rui,Young Joo,Alexander G.","There is a growing number of articles about conversational AI (i.e., ChatGPT) for generating scientific literature reviews and summaries. Yet, comparative evidence lags its wide adoption by many clinicians and researchers. We explored ChatGPT’s utility for literature search from an end-user perspective through the lens of clinicians and biomedical researchers. We quantitatively compared basic versions of ChatGPT’s utility against conventional search methods such as Google and PubMed. We further tested whether ChatGPT user-support tools (i.e., plugins, web-browsing function, prompt-engineering, and custom-GPTs) could improve its response across four common and practical literature search scenarios: (,) high-interest topics with an abundance of information, (,) niche topics with limited information, (,) scientific hypothesis generation, and (,) for newly emerging clinical practices questions. Our results demonstrated that basic ChatGPT functions had limitations in consistency, accuracy, and relevancy. User-support tools showed improvements, but the limitations persisted. Interestingly, each literature search scenario posed different challenges: an abundance of secondary information sources in high interest topics, and uncompelling literatures for new/niche topics. This study tested practical examples highlighting both the potential and the pitfalls of integrating conversational AI into literature search processes, and underscores the necessity for rigorous comparative assessments of AI tools in scientific research."
Microbiology,Cyclic di-AMP drives developmental cycle progression in Chlamydia trachomatis,"Junghoon,Scot P,Junghoon,Scot P,Junghoon","The obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia alternates between two functional forms during its developmental cycle: elementary body (EB) and reticulate body (RB). However, the molecular mechanisms governing the transitions between these forms are unknown. Here, we present evidence cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) is a key factor in triggering the transition from RB to EB (i.e., secondary differentiation) in the chlamydial developmental cycle. By overexpressing or knocking down expression of c-di-AMP synthase genes, we made strains producing different levels of c-di-AMP, which we linked to changes in secondary differentiation status. Increases in c-di-AMP resulted in an earlier increase in transcription of EB-associated genes, and this was further manifested in earlier production of EBs. In contrast, when c-di-AMP levels were decreased, secondary differentiation was delayed. Based on these data, we conclude there is a threshold level of c-di-AMP needed to trigger secondary differentiation in Chlamydia. This is the first study to identify a mechanism by which secondary differentiation is initiated in Chlamydia and reveals a critical role for the second messenger signaling molecule c-di-AMP in this process."
Microbiology,Guided assembly of multispecies positive biofilms targeting undesirable bacteria,"Virgile,Laurent,Cecile,Marie-Francoise,Guillermo,Julia,Pascale,Mathieu,Romain,Virgile,Laurent,Cecile,Marie-Francoise,Guillermo,Julia,Pascale,Mathieu,Romain,Virgile,Laurent,Cecile,Marie-Francoise,Guillermo,Julia,Pascale,Mathieu","The use of synthetic microbial communities (SynComs) engineered to form positive biofilms that prevent the settlement of harmful bacteria is emerging as a promising strategy in biotechnology, particularly in reducing reliance on chemical antimicrobials. Despite this potential, the rationale for selecting specific strains in SynComs and the mechanisms underlying their antagonistic effects remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we present a bottom-up approach integrating live-cell imaging with high-throughput analysis of multi-strain biofilms across diverse scenarios. Through this method, we identified beneficial strains based on their superior ability to exclude undesirable bacteria and form mixed biofilms. Notably, our findings revealed that competitive strains against undesirable bacteria could also exclude other beneficial strains, emphasising the need for compatibility control in SynComs design. SynComs composed of B. velezensis and Pediococcus spp. demonstrated enhanced pathogen exclusion compared to single strains. Temporal analysis of biofilm interactions, supported by mathematical models, showed that pathogen exclusion was primarily driven by nutritional competition (Jameson effect) with additional specific interference mechanisms (prey-predator Lotka-Volterra model). Furthermore, pre-establishing SynComs to surfaces significantly increased pathogen inhibition, indicating a distinct biofilm-associated exclusion effect. These insights offer a framework for rational SynCom design and deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning positive biofilm applications."
Microbiology,Early-life antibiotic exposure leads to gut microbial dysbiosis associated with neurodevelopment and neuroregeneration,"Qing,Pianpian,Qie,Xiaoyu,Xuemei,Xinying,Fan,Xiang,Qingchu,Qing,Pianpian,Qie,Xiaoyu,Xuemei,Xinying,Fan,Xiang,Qingchu,Qing,Pianpian,Qie,Xiaoyu,Xuemei,Xinying,Fan,Xiang","Early-life is a critical period for neurodevelopment and establishment of gut microbiota, which are highly susceptible to antibiotic exposure. Here, we aimed to investigate association between gut microbiota and metabolites with neurodevelopment and neuroregeneration in early-life after antibiotic exposure. To induce microbial dysbiosis in offspring, a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail was administered to mice dams. The prefrontal lobe, spinal cord tissues and gut sample of offspring were collected at different time with or without spinal cord crush injury. 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics were performed to analyze the gut microbiota and metabolites. NG2 glia were cultured and treated by mitochondrial fusion and fission compounds and metabolites. Maternal antibiotic exposure significantly affected neuronal maturation, NG2 glia proliferation, prefrontal cortex myelination and injured spinal cord neuroregeneration of offspring. Mice in antibiotic exposure group exhibited disruption of gut microbiota and metabolites, along with lower Ace, Chao and Shannon indexes, higher relative abundance of Enterobacter and Escherichia_Shigella, lower lactobacillus and Streptococcus genus, and downregulated Cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Val), Ampicilloyl, DG(8:0/i-19:0/0:0), Petasinine and 6-Hydroxymelatonin glucuronide. These metabolites were enriched in alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, linoleic acid metabolism. 6-Hydroxymelatonin glucuronide, PC(20:3/0:0), PC(20:2/0:0), Ameltolide, DG(8:0/i-19:0/0:0), Inproquone, and Chorismate were the cores of networks between gut microbiota and metabolites and negatively associated with neurodevelopment and neuroregeneration. Additionally, gut microbiota metabolites promoted NG2 glia differentiation, partly through reversing the effects of mitochondrial fusion/fission compounds. Totally, antibiotic exposure in early-life changed the composition, abundance, and metabolites of gut microbiota in offspring, which was associated with neurodevelopment and neuroregeneration."
Zoology,A deep learning approach to detect and visualise sexual dimorphism in monomorphic species,"Nicolas J.,Andre C.,Liliana R.,Samuel,Sonia,Julien P.,Rita,Claire,Nicolas J.,Andre C.,Liliana R.,Samuel,Sonia,Julien P.,Rita,Claire,Nicolas J.,Andre C.,Liliana R.,Samuel,Sonia,Julien P.,Rita","Sex recognition is facilitated by dimorphism in some traits. However, humans often fail to find the traits that allow to distinguish between sexes in other species. Deep learning has the potential to surpass humans in identifying cryptic differences between sexes, but, so far, has rarely been used to assess sexual dimorphism. In this study, we evaluated (i) the ability of a fine-tuned classification neural network, EfficientNet, to find differences between sexes in a species that appears monomorphic to humans, the sociable weaver (Philetairus socius). We then assessed (ii) the benefits of Grad-CAM visualisation techniques to understand which parts of the individuals are used by the network to differentiate the sexes. We trained 10-folds cross-validation models on more than 4,500 pictures of the head from more than 1,300 individuals. Our results show that the network can predict sex of sociable weavers with an accuracy of 76%, which is considerably higher than humans' performance, and that the model was similarly good at predicting females and males. When interpreting the probability of being classified to one sex, our results further reveal an effect of the interaction of sex with age on the confidence score of the models which shows that younger males are less masculine than older ones, and older females more masculine than younger ones. Finally, using Grad-CAM we found that the model mostly uses the beak region to predict the sex of individuals. Overall, this work shows that artificial intelligence has the potential to be a non-invasive sexing tool, surpassing human capabilities and aiding in pinpointing potential cryptic dimorphic body parts that have yet to be identified. In birds, half of the world's species appear sexually monomorphic to humans, and re-evaluation of species dimorphism with this type of methods could deepen our understanding of the effect of selection on animal traits."
Microbiology,Characterization of antibiotic resistance development of E. coli in synthetic and real wastewater,"Indorica,Neila,Carly,Yanina,Darash,Devin,Muhammad H,Indorica,Neila,Carly,Yanina,Darash,Devin,Muhammad H,Indorica,Neila,Carly,Yanina,Darash,Devin","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to global health and resistant bacterial populations have been observed to develop and spread in and around wastewater. However, in vitro studies on AMR development are typically conducted in ideal media conditions which can differ in composition and nutrient density from wastewater. In this study, we compare the growth and AMR development of E. coli in standard LB broth to a synthetic wastewater recipe and autoclaved wastewater samples from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA). We found that synthetic wastewater and real wastewater samples both supported less bacterial growth compared to LB. Additionally, bacteria grown in synthetic wastewater and real wastewater samples had differing susceptibility to antibiotic pressure from Doxycycline, Ciprofloxacin, and Streptomycin. However, AMR development over time during continuous passaging under subinhibitory antibiotic pressure was similar in fold change across all media types. Thus, we find that while LB can act as a proxy for wastewater for AMR studies in E. coli, synthetic wastewater is a more accurate predictor of both E.coli growth and antibiotic resistance development. Moreover, we also show that antibiotic resistance can develop in real wastewater samples and components within wastewater likely have synergistic and antagonistic interactions with antibiotics."

Zoology,"Genetic diversity and fine-scale structure of two populations of a subterranean rodent, ","Anna I.,Kristina,Arman M.,Svetlana A.,Anna E.,Eugene A.,Elena V.,Antonina V.,Anna I.,Kristina,Arman M.,Svetlana A.,Anna E.,Eugene A.,Elena V.,Antonina V.,Anna I.,Kristina,Arman M.,Svetlana A.,Anna E.,Eugene A.,Elena V.","Subterranean rodents represent an interesting model system for molecular ecologists. Their lifestyle is associated with fragmented environments, limited dispersal ability, and low fecundity. These characteristics all are expected to increase inter- and intrapopulation differentiation and reduce intra-population genetic diversity, yet the published empirical data revealed the lack of generality of this pattern. This emphasizes the importance of accumulating more data on individual species to understand what factors shape the genetic dynamics of populations. This study represents the first characterization of the population genetic diversity and fine-scale genetic structure of a highly specialized subterranean vole, Ellobius talpinus. We used nine microsatellite loci and a fragment of the mitochondrial D-loop to investigate genetic patterns of two distant populations: the Novosibirsk population at the extreme northeastern edge of the species range, and the sub-peripheral Saratov population. As a result, the two populations exhibit distinct patterns of genetic structure. The Novosibirsk population showed a low nuclear diversity with an observed heterozygosity (Ho) of 0.34 and an unbiased expected heterozygosity (uHe) of 0.55. Mitochondrial D-loop was nearly monomorphic with over 90% of the observed haplotypes being identical, resulting in a haplotype diversity (Hd) of 0.14 and nucleotide diversity (π) of 0.0004. In contrast, the Saratov population displayed moderate nuclear (Ho = 0.64; uHe = 0.76) and high mitochondrial variation (Hd = 0.83; π = 0.034), compared to the surface-dwelling voles. Nine haplotypes representing four well-differentiated mitochondrial clades were found in the Saratov population. In a heterogeneous landscape, significant genetic differentiation was revealed at both intermediate (dozens of kilometers) and fine (several kilometers) scales. However, within the continuous suitable habitat, no fine-scale spatial structure was observed apart from that caused by kin clustering. The spatial genetic patterns revealed in E. talpinus appear to reflect a combination of effects of strong social structure, local natural and anthropogenic barriers limiting dispersal opportunities, and occasional long-distance dispersal."
Synthetic Biology,Aβ-targeting synNotch Receptor for Alzheimer′s Disease: Expanding Applications to Extracellular Protein Aggregates,"Nicholas J,Suckwon,Cynthia J,Julie,Chaska C,Nicholas J,Suckwon,Cynthia J,Julie,Chaska C,Nicholas J,Suckwon,Cynthia J,Julie","The synthetic Notch receptor (synNotch) system is a versatile platform that induces gene transcription in response to extracellular signals. However, its application has been largely confined to membrane-bound targets due to specific activation requirements. Whether synNotch can also target extracellular protein aggregates, such as amyloid beta (Aβ) in Alzheimer′s disease (AD), is unclear. To address this, we engineered an Aβ-targeting synNotch receptor controlling the production of chimeric human-mouse versions of Lecanemab (Leqembi®) or Aducanumab (Aduhelm®), both FDA-approved antibodies for AD. We demonstrate that NIH 3T3 cells expressing this synNotch system detect and respond to extracellular Aβ aggregates by synthesizing and secreting Aducanumab or Lecanemab. These findings broaden the potential applications of synNotch, extending its targets beyond membrane-bound proteins to extracellular protein aggregates, providing obvious benefits to research in this scientific arena."
Scientific Communication and Education,Equity in Action: A Four-Year journey towards Gender Parity and Racial Diversity in Biochemistry Hiring,"Sherri L.,Valerie,Scott,Amy M.,Mark D.,Sherri L.,Valerie,Scott,Amy M.,Mark D.,Sherri L.,Valerie,Scott,Amy M.","Recruitment of faculty members in academic departments shapes the department for decades in both research and teaching arenas. Having a diverse department is beneficial for undergraduate and graduate students as representation of underrepresented minority groups in the professoriate can inspire a greater diversity of students to pursue higher levels of education or research-focused careers. Increased diversity benefits research directly as diverse teams have been shown to have better ideas and outcomes. In 2020, our department had lower gender diversity than would be expected based on the pool of PhD students and post-doctoral fellows in Canada. Therefore, we altered our hiring process, primarily by redacting applications, for recruitment into entry-level tenure-track faculty positions. With this change in process, female hires increased from 17% in the previous ten years (5 hires) to 80% in the subsequent four years (5 hires) with no substantial change in hiring of racially diverse individuals (50% to 40%). Overall, combined with retirements, the percentage of female faculty in the department went from 25% to 50% and the percentage of racialized faculty went from 38% to 44%. The new hires have met or exceeded expectations of success with respect to grant funding and are on track to meet or exceed expectations for other metrics of success. Thus, our intervention was very successful in increasing the diversity of our department within a short timeframe. We believe that our experience could provide other departments with a template for making substantive change, even in the absence of internal expertise in the area."

Although the effects of chelators on metal solubility and bioavailability are well documented, their impact on microbial physiology is not well defined. We measured the growth of ,, a common soil and aquatic bacterium, in the presence of the ubiquitous chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and found that it restricts growth by reducing intracellular iron levels. Using barcoded transposon sequencing, we identified an operonic gene pair, ,, that is required to maintain iron homeostasis during EDTA challenge. , encodes one of four TonB-dependent transporters that are regulated by the ferric uptake repressor (Fur) and stands out among this group of genes in its ability to support , growth across diverse media conditions. The function of CciT strictly requires ,, which encodes a cytoplasmic Fe, dioxygenase-family protein. Our results thus define a functional partnership between an outer membrane iron receptor and a cytoplasmic dioxygenase that are broadly co-conserved in Proteobacteria. We expanded our analysis of the , system to natural environments by measuring the growth of mutant strains in freshwater from two ecologically distinct lakes, which have significantly different nutritional and geochemical profiles compared to standard laboratory media. , and , were not required for growth in lake water, regardless of EDTA presence, highlighting the iron acquisition versatility of , in , environments and underscoring the conditional toxicity of EDTA. This study defines a conserved iron acquisition system and bridges laboratory-based physiology studies to real-world environments."
Microbiology,TamL is a key player of the outer membrane homeostasis in Bacteroidetes.,"Fabio,Tom,Miguel Angel,Frederic,Remy,Marc,Laura,Jonas,Gipsi,Ziqiang,Christian,Francesco,Fabio,Tom,Miguel Angel,Frederic,Remy,Marc,Laura,Jonas,Gipsi,Ziqiang,Christian,Francesco,Fabio,Tom,Miguel Angel,Frederic,Remy,Marc,Laura,Jonas,Gipsi,Ziqiang,Christian","In Proteobacteria, the outer membrane protein TamA and the inner membrane-anchored protein TamB form the Translocation and Assembly Module (TAM) complex, which facilitates the transport of autotransporters, virulence factors, and likely lipids across the two membranes.
In Bacteroidetes TamA is replaced by TamL, a TamA-like lipoprotein with a lipid modification at its N-terminus that likely anchors it to the outer membrane. This structural difference suggests that TamL may have a distinct function compared to TamA. However, the role of TAM in bacterial phyla other than Proteobacteria remains unexplored.
Our study aimed to elucidate the functional importance of TamL in Flavobacterium johnsoniae, an environmental Bacteroidetes. Unlike its homologues in Proteobacteria, we found that TamL and TamB are essential in F. johnsoniae. Through genetic, phenotypic, proteomic, and lipidomic analyses, we discovered that TamL depletion severely compromises outer membrane integrity, as evidenced by reduced cell viability, altered cell shape, increased susceptibility to membrane-disrupting agents, and elevated levels of outer membrane lipoproteins. Notably, we did not observe any impact on outer membrane lipid composition.
Via pull-down protein assays, we confirmed that TamL interacts with TamB in F. johnsoniae, likely forming the TAM complex. Furthermore, our in silico analysis revealed that the presence of TamL and TamB monocistronic genes is a shared genetic feature among Bacteroidetes members, including the human pathogen Capnocytophaga canimorsus where we also confirmed the essentiality of the TamL and TamB homologs. 
To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide functional insights into a TAM subunit beyond Proteobacteria."

CMF genes, containing a single CCT domain, are promising targets for breeding programs. We identified 101 CMF genes from four cotton species. Phylogenetic analysis grouped these genes into six clusters closely related to Arabidopsis. Gene structure and motif analysis showed high conservation, while collinear analysis indicated segmental duplication as a key factor in CMF gene family expansion. Promoter analysis predicted involvement in light, abiotic stress, plant hormone responses, and growth. Expression analysis revealed differential expression of GhCMF genes across tissues, with some induced by abiotic stress. Co-expression network analysis indicated GhCMF14 interacts with other proteins to resist abiotic stress. Subcellular localization showed GhCMF14 in the nucleus. Silencing GhCMF14 enhanced salt tolerance, with higher chlorophyll and proline content, and lower MDA and H2O2 levels. This study provides insights into CMF gene regulation and their role in cotton salt stress tolerance."

Despite extensive research, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 replication remain unclear. To address this, we developed a single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) assay to directly visualize and analyse in vitro RNA synthesis by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We purified the minimal replication complex, comprising nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8, and combined it with fluorescently labelled RNA substrates, enabling real-time monitoring of RNA primer elongation at the single-molecule level. This platform allowed us to investigate the mechanisms of action of key inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication. In particular, our data provides evidence for remdesivir's mechanism of action, which involves polymerase stalling and subsequent chain termination dependent on the concentration of competing nucleotide triphosphates. Our study demonstrates the power of smFRET to provide dynamic insights into SARS-CoV-2 replication, offering a valuable tool for antiviral screening and mechanistic studies of viral RdRp activity."
Scientific Communication and Education,Features and signals in precocious citation impact: a meta-research study,"John,John","Some scientists reach top citation impact in a very short time once they start publishing. The current analysis defined precocious citation impact as rising to become a top-cited scientist within t≤8 years after the first publication year. Ultra-precocious citation impact was defined similarly for t ≤5 years. Top-cited authors included those in the top-2% of a previously validated composite citation indicator across 174 subfields of science or in the top-100,000 authors of that composite citation indicator across all science based on Scopus. Annual data between 2017 and 2023 show a strong increase over time, with 469 precocious and 66 ultra-precocious citation impact Scopus author IDs in 2023. In-depth assessment of validated ultra-precocious scientists in 2023, showed significantly higher frequency of less developed country affiliation (71%), clustering in 4 high-risk subfields (Environmental Sciences, Energy, Artificial Intelligence & Image Processing, Mechanical Engineering & Transports) (64%), self-citations for their field  above the 95th percentile (31%), being top-cited only when self-citations were included (20%), citations to citing papers ratio for their field above the 95th percentile (15%), extreme publishing behavior (7%), and extreme citation orchestration metric c/h2<2.45 (15%) compared with all top-cited authors (p<0.005 for all signals). The 17 ultra-precocious citation impact authors in the 2017-2020 top-cited lists who had retractions by October 2024 showed on average 4 of these 7 signal indicators at the time they entered the top-cited list.

The , type b (Hib) vaccine has led to a significant reduction of invasive Hib disease, but offers no protection against colonisation or disease by non-typeables (NT) or non-b serotypes, and , remains a public health burden worldwide, with increasing reports of multi-drug resistance (MDR). Despite this, there is no comprehensive understanding of the species' global population structure. Here, we whole-genome sequenced >4,000 isolates of , from an unvaccinated paediatric carriage and pneumonia cohort from northwestern Thailand. Despite no Hib immunisation, serotype b was uncommonly found, while 91.7% of isolates were NT. We identified a large number of nearly pan-resistant lineages and discovered that no lineages were enriched among disease samples, suggesting the ability to cause invasive disease is not restricted to any subpopulation. Population genetic analyses of our data combined with nearly 6,000 published genomes revealed a highly admixed population structure, low core genome nucleotide diversity, and evidence of pervasive negative selection. Global isolates confirm that MDR lineages are not confined to our newly-sequenced dataset, and their establishment globally is an urgent concern."
Zoology,Geometric analysis of airway trees shows that lung anatomy evolved to enable explosive ventilation and prevent barotrauma in cetaceans,"Robert,Merryn,Marina,A. Wayne,Robert E,Robert,Merryn,Marina,A. Wayne,Robert E,Robert,Merryn,Marina,A. Wayne","Two new biomechanical challenges faced cetacean lungs compared to their terrestrial ancestors. First, hydrostatic pressures encountered during deep dives are sufficient to cause nearly full lung collapse, risking substantial barotrauma during surfacing if air is trapped in the fragile smaller airways. Second, rapid ventilation in large cetaceans requires correspondingly high ventilatory flow rates. In order to investigate how airway geometry evolved in response to these challenges, we characterized airway geometry from 12 species of cetaceans that vary in common dive depth and ventilatory behavior and a domestic pig using computed tomography. After segmenting the major airways, we generated centerline networks models for the larger airways and computed geometric parameters for each tree including mean branching angle, percent volume fraction, and Strahler branching, diameter, and length ratios. When airway geometry was regressed against ventilatory and diving parameters with phylogenetic least squares, neither average branching angle, percent volume fraction, Strahler length ratio or Strahler branching ratio significantly varied with common ventilatory mode or common diving depth. Higher Strahler diameter ratios were associated with slower ventilation and deeper diving depth, suggesting that cetacean lungs have responded to biomechanical pressures primarily with changes in airway diameter. High Strahler diameter ratios lungs in deeper diving species may help to facilitate more complete collapse of the delicate terminal airways by providing for a greater incompressible volume for air storage at depth. On the other hand, lungs with low Strahler diameter ratios would be better for fast ventilation because the gradual decrease in diameter moving distally should keep peripheral flow resistance low, maximizing ventilatory flow rates."

However, recent sequencing-based studies have indicated that F. necrophorum is positively associated with pregnancy in beef cows and that Fusobacterium is the most abundant genus in the bull seminal microbiota, suggesting the potential role of Fusobacterium in reproductive health and fertility. Here, we performed a comprehensive screening to 1) determine whether Fusobacterium necrophorum (subspecies necrophorum [FNN] and funduliforme [FNF]), and Fusobacterium varium (FV) are part of the commensal members of the reproductive microbiota in cattle; 2) to explore whether these Fusobacterium spp. are colonized in calf prenatally.  For this, we screened 11 different sample types including bovine and ram semen, bovine vaginal and uterine swabs, and bull fecal samples, as well as samples from 180- and 260-days old calf fetuses and their respective dams using both quantitative PCR (514 samples) and targeted culturing (499 samples).  By qPCR, all the targeted Fusobacterium spp. were detected across all sample types, with FNF being the highly prevalent in the bull semen (66.7%) and maternal ruminal fluids (87.1%), which was confirmed by culturing.  All the targeted Fusobacterium were identified in vaginal and uterine (3.1%-9.4%) as well as placental caruncles, and fetal fluids, ruminal and meconium samples (2.7% - 26.3%) by qPCR and were not isolated by culture method. Overall, our results suggest that F. necrophorum is a commensal member of healthy male reproductive microbiota, and that FNF, FNN and FV are present in bovine vagino-uterine microbiota, and calf intestine prenatally."

We introduce an approach to tune and minimize lipidomes in , and the Minimal Cell (JCVI-Syn3A) revealing that a 2-component lipidome can support life. Systematically reintroducing phospholipid features demonstrated that acyl chain diversity is more critical for growth than head group diversity. By tuning lipid chirality, we explored the lipid divide between Archaea and the rest of life, showing that ancestral lipidomes could have been heterochiral. Our approach offers a tunable minimal membrane system to explore the fundamental lipidomic requirements for life, thereby extending the concept of minimal life from the genome to the lipidome."

Strain-level host specialisation is considered typical, yet outbreak monitoring in Martinique revealed a new lineage with dramatically expanded host range had emerged. Our analysis shows the outbreak in Martinique was caused by the expansion of lineages from two different Ralstonia species. One lineage is of Asian origin and retains a signature of host specialisation, while the emergent broad host range lineage originated in the Americas. The presence of similar integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) in both lineages suggests they are exchanging genetic material. The emergent lineage acquired novel prophage along with genes encoding novel catalytic and metabolic functions, but shows little variation among the virulence proteins considered host specificity determinants. We postulate that host range expansion is not caused by the evolution of a virulence strategy targeting host immunity, but is rather due to the acquisition of novel pathways for substrate metabolism enhancing pathogen fitness in soil or plant tissues."

However, the link between gut microbiota and age-related gout remained underexplored. Our study found that gut microbiota plays a crucial role in determining susceptibility to age-related gout. Specifically, we observed that age-related gut microbiota regulated the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and modulated uric acid metabolism. More scrutiny highlighted the positive impact of ""younger"" microbiota on the gut microbiota structure of old or aged mice, enhancing butanoate metabolism and butyric acid content. Experimentation with butyrate supplementation indicated that butyric acid exerts a dual effect, inhibiting inflammation in acute gout and reducing serum uric acid levels. These insights emphasize the potential of gut microbiome rejuvenation in mitigating senile gout, unraveling the intricate dynamics between microbiota, aging, and gout. It potentially serves as a therapeutic target for senile gout-related conditions."
Microbiology,Mitomycin C Retains Efficacy after Adaptive Laboratory Evolution of Staphylococcus aureus,"Maiken E.,Amanda Batoul,Lars,Nis Pedersen,Rikke Louise,Maiken E.,Amanda Batoul,Lars,Nis Pedersen,Rikke Louise,Maiken E.,Amanda Batoul,Lars,Nis Pedersen","Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest threats against human health and the misuse and overuse of antibiotics is a key factor driving resistance development. During prolonged antibiotic treatment of chronic infections, the antimicrobial pressure facilitates selection of antibiotic resistance mutations. It has been suggested that using antibiotics in combinations may reduce the emergence of resistance. Furthermore, antibiotic tolerant persister cells may be a reservoir for resistance development, so targeting persister cells with anti-persister drugs could also reduce the emergence of resistance. "
Microbiology,Impact of media brand on cefiderocol disk diffusion results,"Mia Gabrielle,Allison May,Lindsay E,Heather L.,Tiffany S,Katie E,Amy J,Mia Gabrielle,Allison May,Lindsay E,Heather L.,Tiffany S,Katie E,Amy J,Mia Gabrielle,Allison May,Lindsay E,Heather L.,Tiffany S,Katie E","Introduction: Cefiderocol is a siderophore cephalosporin that utilizes iron transport systems to cross cell membranes. This unique strategy complicates antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) due to variable iron content in media. While guidance for using iron-depleted media exists for broth microdilution (BMD), disk diffusion (DD) with commercial media is a common AST method in the clinical laboratory. We investigated cefiderocol DD result variability using multiple Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) brands. 
Methods: DD results using Remel (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Diego, CA), Hardy (Hardy Diagnostics, Springboro, OH), and BBL (Becton Dickenson, East Rutherford, NJ) MHA were compared to BMD using iron-depleted cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth. BMD reproducibility, BMD trailing endpoints, and DD intra- and inter-brand variability in zones of inhibition were investigated.
Results: Forty-seven multidrug-resistant clinical isolates and three Antibiotic Resistance bank isolates composed of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, carbapenemase (CP-) and non-carbapenemase-producing (non-CP-) carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), Acinetobacter baumannii complex, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Burkholderia cepacia complex were tested. Categorical agreement (CA) ≥90% was only demonstrated using CLSI breakpoints with BBL agar. Intra- and inter-brand variability in DD were greatest for P. aeruginosa and CRE, with 30% (6/20) and 16.7% (3/18) exhibiting discrepant AST interpretations, respectively. Isolates not susceptible to cefiderocol via BMD were commonly associated with AST interpretation errors and lower CA.
Conclusions: Using commercial MHA for DD resulted in frequent AST interpretation discrepancies, particularly for isolates that were not susceptible to cefiderocol by BMD. Methods and quality control may need to be revisited to ensure the reliability of DD for cefiderocol AST."

The DNA extraction with magnetic nanoparticles accommodates these demands by providing a method that is safe, simple, and yet able to give good purity. The purity parameter of the extracted DNA is based on the A260/280 value. This meta-analysis aims to find variables that can affect the purity of extracted DNA using magnetic nanoparticles, based on its extraction and particle synthesis procedure. The information to be analyzed is from DNA extraction from human blood, plasmid extraction, and E. coli gDNA extraction. The research begins with a systematic review to collect appropriate studies and analysis will be carried out using Minitab to find variables that affect the purity of DNA, either positive or negative. Here we show, that no variables have been found significant to the purity of the extracted DNA in both the DNA extraction procedure steps and reagents. For the magnetic nanoparticle synthesis method, for extraction of , gDNA, coating agent TEOS/TiO,; CoZnFe,O, magnetic nanoparticles, and the interaction between CoZnFe,O, and TEOS are found to be variables that influence the purity of the extracted DNA based on A260/280. Hopefully, this information can be used as a development idea, either for the magnetic nanoparticle synthesis procedure or the selection of reagents and DNA extraction procedures. In addition, the results of this analysis can also be used for consideration in an in-house magnetic nanoparticle-based DNA extraction assembly."
Microbiology,Fast Evolution of SOS-Independent Multi-Drug Resistance in Bacteria,"Le,Yunpeng,Yuen Yee,Nural N,Amy,Andrew,Elizabeth,Antoine M,Qian Peter,Dayong,Le,Yunpeng,Yuen Yee,Nural N,Amy,Andrew,Elizabeth,Antoine M,Qian Peter,Dayong,Le,Yunpeng,Yuen Yee,Nural N,Amy,Andrew,Elizabeth,Antoine M,Qian Peter","The killing mechanism of many antibiotics involves the induction of DNA damage, either directly or indirectly, which triggers the SOS response. RecA, the master regulator of the SOS response, plays a crucial role in driving the evolution of resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics treated with a single dose of ciprofloxacin. However, the precise roles of RecA and SOS responses in the development of resistance under short-term β-lactam exposure remain unclear. In the present study, we observed a fast evolution of β-lactam resistance (20-fold) increase in MIC in 8 hours) in E. coli after deleting RecA and exposing the bacteria to a single dose of ampicillin. Notably, once this type of resistance is established, it remains stable and can be passed on to subsequent generations. Unlike earlier studies, we found that the rapid development of resistance relies on the hindrance of DNA repair, a mechanism that operates independently of the SOS response. Additionally, we identified the rapid emergence of drug resistance associated mutations in the resistant bacterial genome, indicating the impairment of DNA repair. Through comprehensive transcriptome sequencing, we discovered that the expression of numerous antioxidative response genes is repressed in recA mutant resistant isolates, resulting in an excessive accumulation of ROS within the cells. This suggests that the induction of ROS drives the fast evolution of antibiotic resistance in RecA-deficient bacteria. 
Collectively, we show that the hindrance of DNA repair hampers cellular fitness, provides bacteria with genetic adaptability to survive in diverse stressful environments, and accelerates the evolution of antibiotic resistance."

Joakim,Anna,Erik,David,Marcos,Juan Salvador,Stefan,D. G. Joakim,Anna,Erik,David,Marcos,Juan Salvador,Stefan,D. G. Joakim,Anna","The dissemination of mobile antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) via horizontal gene transfer is a significant threat to public health globally. The flow of ARGs into and between pathogens, however, remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to develop strategies for managing the antibiotic resistance crisis. Therefore, we aimed to identify genetic and ecological factors that are fundamental for successful horizontal ARG transfer. From the analysis of ~1 million bacterial genomes and >20,000 metagenomes, we developed random forest models that could reliably predict horizontal ARG transfer between bacteria. Our results suggest that genetic incompatibility, measured as nucleotide composition dissimilarity, negatively influences the likelihood of transfer of ARGs between evolutionarily divergent bacteria. Conversely, environmental co-occurrence increased the likelihood, especially in humans and wastewater, in which several environment-specific dissemination patterns were observed. This study provides new ways to predict the spread of ARGs and provides new insights into the mechanisms governing this evolutionary process."

This study was designed to investigate the mechanisms by which inhibition of glycolysis with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) reduces the expansion of TFH cells and the associated autoantibody production in lupus-prone mice. Integrated cellular, transcriptomic, epigenetic and metabolic analyses showed that 2DG reversed the enhanced cell expansion and effector functions, as well as mitochondrial and lysosomal defects in lupus TFH cells, which include an increased chaperone-mediated autophagy induced by TLR7 activation. Importantly, adoptive transfer of 2DG-reprogrammed TFH cells protected lupus-prone mice from disease progression. Orthologs of genes responsive to 2DG in murine lupus TFH cells were overexpressed in the TFH cells of SLE patients, suggesting a therapeutic potential of targeting glycolysis to eliminate aberrant TFH cells and curb the production of autoantibodies inducing tissue damage."

Upon radiotherapy, these pre-existing CD8+ T-cells expand rapidly after their initial decline and are essential and sufficient for early tumor control. Stem-like CD8+ T-cells proliferate and differentiate into effector CD8+ T-cells in response to radiotherapy and are thus key determinants of therapy efficacy. Our findings highlight the critical role of intratumoral stem-like CD8+ T-cells in driving radiotherapy-induced anti-tumor immunity. Our study provides deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of CD8+ T-cells and their critical involvement in tumor control following radiotherapy."

We had found these signals were generated by two fuhc-encoded receptors, called fester and uncle fester. Here we show that fester genes are members of an extended family consisting of >37 loci, and co-expressed with an even more diverse gene family- the fester co-receptors (FcoR). The FcoRs are membrane proteins related to fester, but include conserved tyrosine motifs, including ITIMs and hemITAMs. Both genes are encoded in highly polymorphic haplotypes on multiple chromosomes, revealing an unparalleled level of diversity of innate receptors. Our results also suggest that ITAM/ITIM signal integration is a deeply conserved mechanism that has allowed convergent evolution of innate and adaptive cell-based recognition systems."
Immunology,Lung epithelial progenitor-mediated release of TGF-β regulates induction and persistence of lung CD8+ TRM cells following mucosal BCG vaccination,"Judith A.,Julia,Roland,Paul R.,Denise L.,Andreas,Judith A.,Julia,Roland,Paul R.,Denise L.,Andreas,Judith A.,Julia,Roland,Paul R.,Denise L.","A principal reason for the high global morbidity and mortality of tuberculosis (TB) is the lack of efficacy of the only licensed TB vaccine, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), as parenteral BCG does not induce local pulmonary immune memory. Animal studies have shown that mucosal BCG vaccination provides superior protection against TB due to generation of lung resident memory T cells (TRM). Here, we demonstrated that following mucosal vaccination with the genetically modified virulent BCG strain, BCG::RD1, distal airway epithelial progenitors were mobilized to assist with restoration of alveolar epithelium. By way of their migration-mediated activation of latent TGF-β, lung CD8+ TRM differentiation was induced. Mucosal vaccinations using nonvirulent strains of BCG in which airway epithelial progenitors were not mobilized, as well as genetic inhibition of migration-mediated activation of TGF-β, resulted in significantly lower numbers of lung CD8+ TRM. In addition, we discovered CD8+ cells with ex-lung and stem-like TRM phenotypes that persisted in the lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes for up to four months following mucosal BCG vaccination. These results link airway epithelial progenitor-mediated repair of injured lung tissue with induction of resident T cell memory and delineate why persistence of TRM in the lung is short-lived. These findings may explain why mucosal vaccination with virulent BCG strains is more protective against TB and thus have notable implications for future TB vaccine development."

During homeostasis, Tγδ17 cell effector identity was stable across tissues, including for intestinal T-bet+ Tγδ17 cells that restrained IFNγ production. However, S. typhimurium infection induced intestinal Vγ6+ Tγδ17 cell conversion into type 1 effectors, with loss of IL-17A production and partial RORγt downregulation. Multiome analysis revealed a trajectory along Vgγ+ Tγδ17 effector conversion, with TIM-3 marking ex-Tγδ17 cells with enhanced type 1 functionality. Lastly, we characterized and validated a critical AP-1 regulatory axis centered around JunB and Fosl2 that controls Vγ6+ Tγδ17 cell plasticity by stabilizing type 3 identity and restricting type 1 effector conversion."
Microbiology,An Update on Active and Passive Surveillance for African Swine Fever in the Dominican Republic,"Rachel A,Nianet,Silvia,Andres,Rachel A,Nianet,Silvia,Andres,Rachel A,Nianet,Silvia","African Swine Fever (ASF) is a viral, hemorrhagic disease of swine that is reportable to the World Organisation for Animal Health. Since 2007, ASF has been expanding globally and caused severe disruption to the global swine industry. In 2021, ASF was detected in the Dominican Republic, prompting an emergency response from local and international officials. Nearly three years later, ASF is still present in the country despite control efforts. This study used data from January 2023-March 2024 from government-mandated sampling of commercial farms, a newly initiated active surveillance program of backyard farms, and passive reports to provide a comprehensive and descriptive assessment of ASF in the Dominican Republic. The attack rate for each region was calculated, and the reproductive ratio (R0) was estimated using the doubling time method. ASF continues to be distributed throughout the Dominican Republic with lower attack rates in central regions and R0 nearing 1. These results suggest that ASF in the country is reaching a stable state that does not resemble an epidemic situation. This may suggest the need to change from an approach of emergency response to one of sustained and progressive control, ultimately for the long-term goal of ASF eradication in the Dominican Republic."
Immunology,Assessing the Generalization Capabilities of TCR Binding Predictors via Peptide Distance Analysis,"Leonardo V,Filippo,Pierre,Anja,Federico,Leonardo V,Filippo,Pierre,Anja,Federico,Leonardo V,Filippo,Pierre,Anja","Understanding the interaction between T Cell Receptors (TCRs) and peptide-bound Major Histocompatibility Complexes (pMHCs) is crucial for comprehending immune responses and developing targeted immunotherapies. While recent machine learning (ML) models show remarkable success in predicting TCR-pMHC binding within training data, these models often fail to generalize to peptides outside of their training distributions, raising concerns about their applicability in therapeutic settings. Understanding and improving the generalization of these models is therefore critical to ensure real-world applications.

To address this issue, we evaluate the effect of the distance between training and testing peptide distributions on ML model empirical risk assessments, using sequence-based and 3D structure-based distance metrics. In our analysis we use several state-of-the-art models for TCR-peptide binding prediction: Attentive Variational Information Bottleneck (AVIB), NetTCR-2.0 and -2.2, and ERGO II (pre-trained autoencoder) and ERGO II (LSTM).

In this work, we introduce a novel approach for assessing the generalization capabilities of TCR binding predictors: the Distance Split (DS) algorithm. The DS algorithm controls the distance between training and testing peptides based on both sequence and structure, allowing for a more nuanced evaluation of model performance. We show that lower 3D shape similarity between training and test peptides is associated with a harder out-of-distribution task definition, which is more interesting when measuring the ability to generalize to unseen peptides. However, we observe the opposite effect when splitting using sequence-based similarity. These findings highlight the importance of using a distance-based splitting approach to benchmark models. This could then be used to estimate a confidence score on predictions on novel and unseen peptides, based on how different they are from the training ones. Additionally, our results may hint that employing 3D shape to complement sequence information could improve the accuracy of TCR-pMHC binding predictors."

While niclosamide (NIC) has shown potential for repurposing in HCC, its poor water solubility and low bioavailability limit its efficacy, and its mechanisms of action are not yet fully elucidated. 
Methods: We designed a water-soluble NIC prodrug (NIC-PS) and evaluated its efficacy through in vitro and in vivo studies, including pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) assays, HCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were applied in two independent experiments, vasorin (VASN) knockout models, and combination treatments with NIC-PS and sorafenib or anti-PD-L1 antibody. Bioinformatic analyses and western blotting were used to investigate NIC-PSprime or minutes target, VASN, and related signaling pathways. 
Results: NIC-PS exhibited a ten-fold increase in oral bioavailability and reduced tumor volume by over 75% in HCC PDX models. NIC-PS directly binds and suppresses VASN, suppressing TGFlower case Greek beta; signaling and reducing SMAD2/3 phosphorylation. VASN inhibition led to a 50% tumor reduction, and NIC-PS enhanced responses to sorafenib and anti-PD-L1 therapy.
Conclusions: NIC-PS, equal to 36% of NIC in molecular weight, offers improved bioavailability, efficacy, and a novel mechanism of action in targeting VASN, showing promise for HCC treatment alone or in combination therapy."

During hibernation, animals undergo extreme shifts in metabolic rate, heart rate, respiration, and body temperature. These changes reduce energy consumption and allow animals to survive solely on their fat reserves. Understanding the mechanisms for these extreme shifts has long been recognized as a model for translational medicine as hibernators do not exhibit the same adverse effects of extended immobility that non-hibernating mammals suffer. Though work on individual species has illuminated important mechanisms of these functional changes, the genomic basis of this phenotype remains largely unknown, and few studies have drawn on comparative work to elucidate commonalities across diverse hibernating mammals. Synthesizing both single species and comparative approaches, we use metabolomic data from active and denning black bears (Ursus americanus) to guide bioinformatic analyses of genes using tests of selection and evolutionary rate convergence across independent lineages of hibernating mammals. We identify several genes with significant signatures of selection and evolutionary rate convergence in hibernators that represent both previously known and novel genetic mechanisms of the hibernation phenotype. These data provide novel insights into the genetic basis of this adaptation and serve to direct clinical research in hibernation-based therapies."

Tumoroids present an avenue for modelling this diversity and replicating the intricate tumor heterogeneity. Spatial transcriptomics preserves the spatial context of gene expression enabling us to study distinct tumor areas and the influence on overall diversity. Our spatial transcriptomics analysis uncovered tumor clusters with distinct genetic profiles that showcase various functional areas in depth and offer valuable understandings into the diversity of ccRCC types. Some of these tumor clusters exhibited activity in genes responsible for protein catabolism and reduced abundance of genes related to mitochondrial respiration processes. We also show isoform expression within tumoroids, in particular glutaminase (GLS) especially with the prevalence of the highly metabolically active GAC isoform that is expressed in regions where mitochondrial gene abundance is lower; whereas the KGA isoform displayed a more focal expression pattern. Combining long-read spatial transcriptomics with organoid models presents a novel strategy for unravelling gene and transcript level complexity."

Cellular phenotypes can be useful in-vitro models for understanding the aetiology of organism-level (in-vivo) phenotypes (e.g., anti-viral response in immune cells and infectious disease outcomes). However, demonstrating relevance between cellular and organism-level phenotypes is non-trivial. If a cellular phenotype is relevant, then we should observe that perturbed genes impacting the cellular phenotype also impact the organism-level phenotype with mechanism-consistent directionality. We propose a framework, loss-of-function instrumental variable analysis (LoF-IV), to evaluate relevance between cellular and organism-level phenotypes using estimates of gene effects on cellular phenotypes from perturbation screens and estimates of gene effects on human-level phenotypes from loss-of-function burden tests. Using data from four published genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens and UK Biobank whole-genome sequence burden tests, we evaluated relevance of four in-vitro cellular phenotypes (chondrocyte proliferation, insulin content, adipocyte differentiation, lysosomal cholesterol accumulation) to human-level phenotypes. We found evidence that higher lysosomal cholesterol accumulation lowers LDL-cholesterol measured in human blood plasma (P = 0.0006), consistent with the known role of lysosomes in lipid biosynthesis. However, we did not find strong evidence for phenotypic relevance of the other cellular phenotypes, illustrating the complexities of developing disease-relevant in-vitro models. LoF-IV enables systematic evaluation of the relevance of cellular phenotypes to the human phenome informing assay prioritization and supporting novel hypothesis generation."

Across organisms, centromeres are rich in selfish genetic elements such as transposable elements and satellite DNAs that can bias their transmission through meiosis. However, these elements still need to cooperate at some level and contribute to, or avoid interfering with, centromere function. To gain insight into the balance between conflict and cooperation at centromeric DNA, we take advantage of the close evolutionary relationships within the Drosophila simulans clade, D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. mauritiana, and their relative, D. melanogaster. Using chromatin profiling combined with high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization on stretched DNA, we characterize all centromeres across these species. We discovered dramatic centromere reorganization involving recurrent shifts between retroelements and satellite DNAs over short evolutionary timescales. We also reveal the recent origin (<240 Kya) of telocentric chromosomes in D. sechellia, where the X and 4th centromeres now sit on telomere-specific retroelements. Finally, the Y chromosome centromeres, which are the only chromosomes that do not experience female meiosis, do not show dynamic cycling between satDNA and TEs. The patterns of rapid centromere turnover in these species are consistent with genetic conflicts in the female germline and have implications for centromeric DNA function and karyotype evolution. Regardless of the evolutionary forces driving this turnover, the rapid reorganization of centromeric sequences over short evolutionary timescales highlights their potential as hotspots for evolutionary innovation."

Characterized by a distinct and aggressive metastatic pattern, HGSOC can originate in the fallopian tube with the transformation of fallopian tube epithelial (FTE) cells, which metastasize to the ovary and subsequently to the omentum and peritoneal cavity. The omentum is a privileged metastatic site, and the metabolic exchange underlying omental metastasis could provide enzyme or receptor targets to block spread. In this study, we adapted a mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) protocol to investigate spatial location of 3D cocultures of tumorigenic FTE cells when grown in proximity to murine omental explants as a model of early metastatic colonization. Our analysis revealed several altered metabolites in tumorigenic FTE/omentum cocultures, namely changes in branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), including valine. We quantified the heightened consumption of valine, other BCAAs, and other amino acid-derived metabolites in omental cocultures using LC-MS assays. Our analysis revealed that metabolite concentrations when monitored with MSI from cell culture media in living culture systems have notable considerations for how MSI data may produce signatures that induce ionization suppression. Supplementation with valine enhanced proliferation and mTOR signaling in tumorigenic FTE cells, suggesting the potential of BCAA's as a nutrient utilized by tumor cells during omental colonization and a possible target for metastasis."
Genetics,Harnessing Global HLA Data for Enhanced Patient Matching in iPSC Haplobanks,"Martin,Stephen,Christopher,Christina,Mark L,David,Martin,Stephen,Christopher,Christina,Mark L,David,Martin,Stephen,Christopher,Christina,Mark L","Several countries have either developed or are developing national induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) banks of cell lines derived from donors with HLA homozygous genotypes (two identical haplotypes) prevalent in their local populations to provide immune matched tissues and cells to support regenerative medicine therapies. This haplobank approach relies on knowledge of the HLA genotypes of the population to identify the most beneficial haplotypes for patient coverage, and ultimately identify donors or cord blood units carrying two copies of the target haplotype. A potentially more efficient alternative to a national bank approach is to assess the haplotypes required to provide global patient coverage and to produce a single, global haplobank. Toward that end, we have developed an algorithm to prioritize HLA haplotypes that optimize coverage across the global population. 

We analyzed data from eighteen countries participating in the Global Alliance for iPS Therapy (GAiT). A representative pool of HLA genotypes, reflecting the HLA of patients, was derived by sampling from each countrys WMDA hematopoietic stem cell donor registry, or surrogate population. An algorithm was created based on HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 haplotype homozygous types with population HLA matching coverage defined by the absence of Host versus Graft (HvG) mismatches at these loci. HLA matching coverage was determined by iteratively selecting HLA haplotypes that provide the largest coverage against patient HLA genotypes sampled from the same population, excluding genotypes compatible with previous iterations. The top 10 haplotypes for each of the 18 countries were identified with patient coverage ranging from 19.5% in Brazil to 63.8% in Japan, with a mean coverage of 33.3%. In a global model, utilizing the 180 most frequent haplotypes across all 18 populations (equivalent to 10 lines per country), the patient coverage ranged from 54.6% in India to 81.7% in Sweden, with a mean of 68.4%.  Our findings demonstrate that global collaboration could more than double the potential for patient HLA matching coverage.

Interrogation of unrelated hematopoietic stem cell donor registry and cord blood bank HLA data demonstrated that HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 homozygous donors for the top 180 global haplotypes are widely available. These results show that a globally coordinated strategy for haplobanking would reduce redundancy and allow more patients to be treated with the same investment."

Our study characterizes the function of conserved SLiMs in P. aeruginosa RNase E, including a duplicated sequence termed the ""REER-repeats"" region. This region, along with AR1 and AR4 SLiMs, mediates RNA binding and localizes the degradosome in subcellular foci. Pull-down and bacterial two-hybrid assays identified PNPase and RhlB as interacting proteins, with direct interactions confirmed via protein binding assays. The NDPR and AR1 SLiMs mediate these interactions, respectively.

Traditional CTAB-based DNA extraction methods, while effective, involve hazardous chemicals and require high-speed centrifugation, which are impractical in many field settings. Our approach utilizes a household dish detergent-based buffer, sodium chloride, and polyvinylpyrrolidone K-30 to extract DNA from , needle leaf tissues—without the need for liquid nitrogen. The simplicity of this method makes it more accessible and environmentally friendly. The extracted DNA was successfully used in PCR-RFLP analysis, targeting a single nucleotide polymorphism in the , gene, demonstrating its efficacy for genotyping. The PCR-RFLP markers reliably discriminated between individual genotypes, confirming the practical application of our simple extraction method, even for conifers containing inhibitory substances. This technique is particularly advantageous for use in arboretums and field stations, where the use of hazardous chemicals, specialized equipment, and a draft chamber is limited. Our study contributes to genetic resource management by providing an easy, reliable, and safer method for DNA extraction and genetic analysis."

Thus, physical activity (acute stress) is mostly beneficial to the body, whereas psycho-emotional stress (chronic stress) is usually detrimental at the psychological, physiological, and pathological levels. Although physical activity exerts anticancer effects and psycho-emotional stress exhibits cancer-promoting effects, both function through the same pathway involving activation of the sympathetic nervous system, release of catecholamines, and stimulation of β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) expressed on cancer cells. Here, salmeterol xinafoate was chosen to mimic physical activity. A once-weekly administration of salmeterol xinafoate by the intraperitoneal, inhalation, or transdermal route, dose-dependently extended latency, reduced cancer incidence and growth, and prolonged survival in vivo. Remarkably, the best complete response rates were 75%, 30%, and 71.43% for the therapeutic treatment of lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma, respectively. Notably, the salmeterol xinafoate doses used in our experiments are comparable to those used in patients. Moreover, in endogenous β2AR knockout cancer cells, the exogenous β2AR mutant with impaired salmeterol xinafoate binding or downstream signaling prevented the anticancer effects of salmeterol xinafoate in vivo, demonstrating the on-target action of salmeterol xinafoate on cancer cells and the requirement of the downstream signaling pathway. Finally, we showed that treatment with salmeterol xinafoate dose-dependently decreased the self-renewal capacity of lung cancer stem cells, breast cancer stem cells, and melanoma stem cells. From the perspective of human evolution into cancer biology, our study reveals that β2AR represents an ideal anticancer drug target and that salmeterol xinafoate monotherapy has strong anticancer activity."
Ecology,14C-age of carbon used to grow fine roots reflects tree carbon status,"Boaz,Emily F.,Frank,Iris,David,Susan,Boaz,Emily F.,Frank,Iris,David,Susan,Boaz,Emily F.,Frank,Iris,David","'Bomb' 14C ages in trees indicate the time elapsed between carbon fixation into nonstructural carbon (NSC) and its use for metabolism and growth. It remains unknown why newly grown aboveground tissues have a narrow range of young 14C-ages, while fine root ages can span decades. We measured 14C in tissues of two coniferous species along an alpine treeline ecotone and used a mixing model to estimate the fraction of NSC that is metabolically active. We expected that greater growth limitation higher in the ecotone would supply more freshly fixed NSC to respiration, active NSC, carbohydrates, and roots, resulting in younger 14C-ages of NSC used to grow tissues. Results confirmed an increase in fresh NSC supply with elevation. Needle and branch growth was supported by young NSC (< 2 yr) with little elevation influence, while root growth was supported by older NSC that declined from 10 to 6 yr with elevation. Massive allocation of fresh NSC to needles and branches could explain their young 14C-ages. Variable fine root 14C-ages reflect tree C status, with older ages when aboveground growth limits the contribution of new C belowground, while young ages represent greater delivery of fresh NSC to roots."
Evolutionary Biology,Evolution of dosage-sensitive genes by tissue-restricted expression changes,"Alan M.,Yuanshuo,Pauric,Aoife,Alan M.,Yuanshuo,Pauric,Aoife,Alan M.,Yuanshuo,Pauric","Dosage-sensitive genes have characteristic patterns of evolution that include being refractory to small-scale duplication, depleted on human benign copy number variants (CNVs) and enriched on pathogenic CNVs. This intolerance to copy number change is likely due to an expression constraint that exists in one or more tissues. While genomic copy number changes alter the encompassed genes' expression across all tissues, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) {genomic regions harbouring sequence variants that influence the expression level of one or more genes) can act in a tissue-specific manner. In this work we examine expression variation of presumed dosage-sensitive and non-dosage-sensitive genes to discover how the locus duplicability constraints translate into gene expression constraints. Here we test the hypothesis that expression changes due to the presence of eQTLs acting in unconstrained tissues will not be deleterious and thus allow dosage-sensitive genes to vary expression while obeying constraints in other tissues. Using eQTLs across 48 human tissues from The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project , we find that dosage-sensitive genes are enriched for being affected by eQTLs and that the eQTLs affecting dosage-sensitive genes are biased towards having narrow tissue-specificity with these genes having fewer eQTL-affected tissues than non-dosage-sensitive genes. Additionally, we find that dosage-sensitive genes are depleted for being affected by broad tissue breadth eQTLs, likely due to the increased chance of these eQTLs conflicting with expression constraints and being removed by purifying selection. These patterns suggest that dosage-sensitivity shapes the evolution of these genes by precluding copy number evolution and restricting their evolutionary trajectories to changes in expression regulation compatible with their functional constraints. Thus deeper interpretation of the patterns of constraints can be informative of the temporal or spatial location of the gene dosage sensitivity and contribute to our understanding of functional genomics."
Evolutionary Biology, strengthens the match between pre-mating and early post-mating isolation in spider mites,"Miguel A.,Sara,Murat,Flore,Miguel A.,Sara,Murat,Flore,Miguel A.,Sara,Murat","Endosymbiotic reproductive manipulators are widely studied as sources of post-zygotic isolation in arthropods, but their effect on pre-zygotic isolation between genetically differentiated populations has garnered less attention. We tested this using two partially isolated populations of the red and green colour forms of ,, either uninfected or infected with different , strains, one inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility and the other not. We first investigated male and female preferences, and found that, in absence of infection, females were not choosy but all males preferred red-form females. , effects were more subtle, with only the CI-inducing strain slightly strengthening colour-form based preferences. We then performed a double-mating experiment to test how incompatible matings affect subsequent mating behaviour and offspring production, as compared to compatible matings. Females mated with an incompatible male (infected and/or heterotypic) were more attractive and/or receptive to subsequent (compatible) matings, although analyses of offspring production revealed no clear benefit for this re-mating behaviour (i.e., apparently unaltered first male sperm precedence). Finally, by computing the relative contributions of each reproductive barrier to total isolation, we showed that pre-mating isolation matches both host-associated and ,-induced post-mating isolation, suggesting that , could contribute to reproductive isolation in this system."
Evolutionary Biology,Functional characterization of luciferase in a brittle star indicates parallel evolution influenced by genomic availability of haloalkane dehalogenase,"Emily S,Marika,Nicholai M,Arnab,Michal,Daniel,Jiri,Zbynek,Jerome,Wendy-Shirley,Elise,Paola,Ferdinand,Martin,Todd H,Emily S,Marika,Nicholai M,Arnab,Michal,Daniel,Jiri,Zbynek,Jerome,Wendy-Shirley,Elise,Paola,Ferdinand,Martin,Todd H,Emily S,Marika,Nicholai M,Arnab,Michal,Daniel,Jiri,Zbynek,Jerome,Wendy-Shirley,Elise,Paola,Ferdinand,Martin","Determining why convergent traits use distinct versus shared genetic components is crucial for understanding how evolutionary processes generate and sustain biodiversity. However, the factors dictating the genetic underpinnings of convergent traits remain incompletely understood. Here, we use heterologous protein expression, biochemical assays, and phylogenetic analyses to confirm the origin of a luciferase gene from haloalkane dehalogenases in the brittle star ,. Through database searches and gene tree analyses, we also show a complex pattern of presence and absence of haloalkane dehalogenases across organismal genomes. These results first confirm parallel evolution across a vast phylogenetic distance, because octocorals like , also use luciferase derived from haloalkane dehalogenases. This parallel evolution is surprising, even though previously hypothesized, because many organisms that also use coelenterazine as the bioluminescence substrate evolved completely distinct luciferases. The inability to detect haloalkane dehalogenases in the genomes of several bioluminescent groups suggests that the distribution of this gene family influences its recruitment as a luciferase. Together, our findings highlight how biochemical function and genomic availability help determine whether distinct or shared genetic components are used during the convergent evolution of traits like bioluminescence."
Evolutionary Biology,Transcriptomic bases of within- and trans-generational predator-induced plasticity in the freshwater snail Physa acuta,"Leo,Nathanelle,Juliette,Maxime,Tristan,Lara,Sandrine,Emilien,Leo,Nathanelle,Juliette,Maxime,Tristan,Lara,Sandrine,Emilien,Leo,Nathanelle,Juliette,Maxime,Tristan,Lara,Sandrine","Inducible defences in response to predation risk are a well-known example of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. While inducible defences have been mainly studied within a generation (within-generational plasticity), there is now clear evidence that the ancestral exposure to predation risk can influence the defences expressed by the offspring, even if they have not been exposed themselves (transgenerational plasticity). The molecular mechanisms allowing the transmission of environmental information across generations are still misunderstood. In this study, we combined measures of anti-predator responses (behavioural and morphological) with transcriptomic investigations across two generations in the freshwater snail Physa acuta. We hypothesised that both within- and transgenerational plasticity would induce phenotypic changes associated with differential gene expression. Our results confirmed within- and transgenerational plasticity: F1 snails have responded to predator-cue exposure by increasing escape behaviour, reducing shell length, and developing thicker and slender shells and F2 from exposed parents have shown similar responses. Within- and transgenerational plasticity were accompanied by the differential expression of 78 genes (77 up- and 1 down-regulated) and 14 differentially expressed genes (13 up- and 1 down-regulated), respectively. Within- and transgenerational plasticity did not share common differentially expressed genes but some differentially expressed genes in F1 are also highly expressed in F2 and overall, the molecular functions were similar, involving metabolism and transcription regulation. The quantitatively low molecular response associated with transgenerational plasticity suggests that gene expression changes induced by parental exposure may have occurred early in development and have decreased at adult stage."
Evolutionary Biology,Heterozygote advantage can explain the extraordinary diversity of immune genes,"Mattias,Claus,Mattias,Claus,Mattias","The majority of highly polymorphic genes are related to immune functions and with over 100 alleles within a population, genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are the most polymorphic loci in vertebrates. How such extraordinary polymorphism arose and is maintained is controversial. One possibility is heterozygote advantage (HA), which can in principle maintain any number of alleles, but biologically explicit models based on this mechanism have so far failed to reliably predict the coexistence of significantly more than ten alleles. We here present an eco-evolutionary model showing that evolution can result in the emergence and maintenance of more than 100 alleles under HA if the following two assumptions are fulfilled: first, pathogens are lethal in the absence of an appropriate immune defence; second, the effect of pathogens depends on host condition, with hosts in poorer condition being affected more strongly. Thus, our results show that HA can be a more potent force in explaining the extraordinary polymorphism found at MHC loci than currently recognized."
Evolutionary Biology,Dominant contribution of Asgard archaea to eukaryogenesis,"Victor,Jacob,Yuri I.,Eugene V.,Victor,Jacob,Yuri I.,Eugene V.,Victor,Jacob,Yuri I.","Origin of eukaryotes is one of the key problems in evolutionary biology. The demonstration that the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) already contained the mitochondrion, an endosymbiotic organelle derived from an alphaproteobacterium, and the discovery of Asgard archaea, the closest archaeal relatives of eukaryotes inform and constrain evolutionary scenarios of eukaryogenesis. We undertook a comprehensive analysis of the origins of the core eukaryotic genes tracing to the LECA within a rigorous statistical framework centered around evolutionary hypotheses testing using constrained phylogenetic trees. The results reveal dominant contributions of Asgard archaea to the origin of most of the conserved eukaryotic functional systems and pathways. A limited contribution from Alphaproteobacteria was identified, primarily relating to the energy transformation systems and Fe-S cluster biogenesis, whereas ancestry from other bacterial phyla was scattered across the eukaryotic functional landscape, without consistent trends. These findings suggest a model of eukaryogenesis in which key features of eukaryotic cell organization evolved in the Asgard ancestor, followed by the capture of the Alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont, and augmented by numerous but sporadic horizontal acquisition of genes from other bacteria both before and after endosymbiosis."
Evolutionary Biology,Bayesian Inference of Pathogen Phylogeography using the Structured Coalescent Model,"Ian,Richard G,Jere,Xavier,Ian,Richard G,Jere,Xavier,Ian,Richard G,Jere","Over the past decade, pathogen genome sequencing has become well established as a powerful approach to study infectious disease epidemiology. In particular, when multiple genomes are available from several geographical locations, comparing them is informative about the relative size of the local pathogen populations as well as past migration rates and events between locations. The structured coalescent model has a long history of being used as the underlying process for such phylogeographic analysis. However, the computational cost of using this model does not scale well to the large number of genomes frequently analysed in pathogen genomic epidemiology studies. Several approximations of the structured coalescent model have been proposed, but their effects are difficult to predict. Here we show how the exact structured coalescent model can be used to analyse a precomputed dated phylogeny, in order to perform Bayesian inference on the past migration history, the effective population sizes in each location, and the directed migration rates from any location to another. We describe an efficient reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme which is implemented in a new R package. We use simulations to demonstrate the scalability and correctness of our method and to compare it with existing comparable software. We also applied our new method to several state-of-the-art  datasets on the population structure of real pathogens to showcase the relevance of our method to current data scales and research questions."
Evolutionary Biology,Lineage-aware evolutionary analysis of hepatitis C virus within-host dynamics,"Lele,Matthew,Prahalad,Mahan,Steven,Haiting,Paul,Eleanor,M Azim,Katrina A.,Lele,Matthew,Prahalad,Mahan,Steven,Haiting,Paul,Eleanor,M Azim,Katrina A.,Lele,Matthew,Prahalad,Mahan,Steven,Haiting,Paul,Eleanor,M Azim","Analysis of viral genetic data has previously revealed distinct within-host population structures in both untreated and interferon-treated chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. While multiple subpopulations persisted during the infection, each subpopulation was observed only intermittently. However, it was unknown whether similar patterns were also present after Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) treatment, where viral populations were often assumed to go through narrow bottlenecks. Here we tested for the maintenance of population structure after DAA treatment failure. We analysed whole-genome next-generation sequencing data generated from a randomised study using DAAs (the BOSON study). We focused on samples collected from patients (N=84) who did not achieve sustained virological response (i.e. treatment failure) and had sequenced virus from multiple timepoints. For each individual, we tracked concordance in nucleotide variant frequencies through time. Using a sliding window approach, we applied sequenced-based and tree-based clustering algorithms across the entire HCV genome. Finally, we reconstructed viral haplotypes and estimated lineage specific within-host divergence rates from the haplotype phylogenies. Distinct viral subpopulations were maintained among a high proportion of individuals post DAA treatment failure. Using maximum likelihood modelling and model comparison, we found an overdispersion of viral evolutionary rates among individuals, and significant differences in evolutionary rates between lineages within individuals. These results suggest the virus is compartmentalised within individuals, with the varying evolutionary rates due to different viral replication rates or different selection pressures. We propose lineage awareness in future analyses of HCV evolution and infections to avoid conflating patterns from distinct lineages, and to recognise the likely existence of unsampled subpopulations."
Genetics, minigene analysis of 161 sequence changes provides evidence for role of spatial constraint and regulatory elements on variant-induced splicing impact,"Daffodil M.,Inés,Cristina,Lara,Elena,Miguel,Amanda B.,Eladio A.,Daffodil M.,Inés,Cristina,Lara,Elena,Miguel,Amanda B.,Eladio A.,Daffodil M.,Inés,Cristina,Lara,Elena,Miguel,Amanda B.",
Ecology,Territoriality and resource availability modulate the effect of conspecific encounters on the foraging behaviours of a mammalian predator,"Jeanne,Frederic,Marie-Pier,Dominique,Jeanne,Frederic,Marie-Pier,Dominique,Jeanne,Frederic,Marie-Pier","The probability of encountering conspecifics shapes multiple dimensions of animal behaviour. For example, territorial individuals increase vigilance, scent marking and alarm calling when approaching home range boundaries. Whether territorial predators modify their foraging behaviours with respect to the probability of encountering neighbouring territory owners is poorly understood. However, this could strongly influence the landscape of predation risk and therefore modulate predator-prey interactions. We studied the movements and behaviours of 23 resident Arctic foxes occupying neighbouring home ranges during two years of contrasting resource availability (abundant resources in 2019, scarce resources in 2022) on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada. First, based on simultaneous GPS tracking of individuals, we established which individuals used a territory (an exclusive area) by estimating the spatial distribution of the probability of encountering a neighbour within their home range. Second, using GPS and accelerometry data, we evaluated if the probability of encountering a neighbour influenced the spatial distribution of foraging behaviours, and whether this relationship differed between territorial and non-territorial individuals. When resources were abundant, only breeding individuals excluded other foxes from a part of their home range and were thus territorial. When resources were rare, none of the foxes reproduced and all but one were territorial. Non-territorial individuals in 2019 were less likely to cache prey in areas with a high probability of encounter, possibly reducing the risk of cache pilfering. We found no effect of the probability of encounter on the behaviours of the non-territorial individual in 2022. The probability to cache prey of territorial individuals however did not depend on the probability of encountering a neighbour, suggesting they have no benefit of modulating the distribution of their caches according to potential encounters in a partly exclusive area. Our results thus suggest that Arctic foxes use different tactics to secure resources based on their degree of territoriality and the availability of resources. We highlight how the presence of resident, but non-territorial predators, whose home ranges overlap those of their territorial neighbours, may influence the distribution of predation risk by creating zones where predator density is high, potentially influencing predator-prey interactions."
Cancer Biology,Mutant p53 regulates cancer cell invasion in complex three-dimensional environments through mevalonate pathway-dependent Rho/ROCK signaling,"Asja,Tatsuya,Alexander J.,Gizem,Raúl,Karen,Kausik,Iris G.,Rachel C.,Rafaela,Anil K.,Laura J.,Carol,Asja,Tatsuya,Alexander J.,Gizem,Raúl,Karen,Kausik,Iris G.,Rachel C.,Rafaela,Anil K.,Laura J.,Carol,Asja,Tatsuya,Alexander J.,Gizem,Raúl,Karen,Kausik,Iris G.,Rachel C.,Rafaela,Anil K.,Laura J.","Certain mutations can confer neomorphic gain of function (GOF) activities to the p53 protein that affect cancer progression. Yet the concept of mutant p53 GOF has been challenged. Here, using various strategies to alter the status of mutant versions of p53 in different cell lines, we demonstrate that mutant p53 stimulates cancer cell invasion in three-dimensional environments. Mechanistically, mutant p53 enhances RhoA/ROCK-dependent cell contractility and cell-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) re-organization via increasing mevalonate pathway-dependent RhoA localization to the membrane. In line with this, RhoA-dependent pro-invasive activity is also mediated by IDI-1, a mevalonate pathway product. Further, the invasion-enhancing effect of mutant p53 is dictated by the biomechanical properties of the surrounding ECM, thereby adding a cell-independent layer of regulation to mutant p53 GOF activity that is mediated by dynamic reciprocal cell-ECM interactions. Together our findings link mutant p53 metabolic GOF activity with an invasive cellular phenotype in physiologically relevant and context-dependent settings."

But doing so for intertidal species with large distribution ranges, while also accounting for the effect of local adaptation, presents numerous technical challenges. Here, we assessed the macroecological consequences of thermal stress on the cold-adapted brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum across its European distribution. We collected specimens from ten populations spanning latitudes 41N to 60N and subjected them to simulated intertidal heat stress using a novel, custom-built experimental setup that replicated realistic conditions, including tidal cycles, light conditions, and temperature trajectories based on in situ data. Our factorial design comprised eight experimental treatments, combining two high-tide water temperatures (15 C and 20.5 C) with four low-tide peak temperatures (28.5 C to 40.5 C). Physiological performance was evaluated through measurements of growth, mortality, and oxygen production. Results indicate that thermal stress is more closely associated with the magnitude of temperature change between high and low tides rather than the absolute maximum temperatures reached. Algae exposed to warmer water temperatures (20.5 C) consistently outperformed those in colder water (15 C), suggesting that cold upwelled waters at the species' southern limit may not be essential for survival. Southern populations demonstrated higher resilience to thermal stress than central and northern counterparts. Integrating these physiological responses with climate projections, we employed demographic models to forecast long-term population dynamics. The models predict that future climatic conditions could exceed the thermal resilience of specific populations, leading to uneven impacts across the European distribution of the species. Notwithstanding, range contractions may occur at the warm edge of the distribution, where populations, though more resilient to thermal stress, could still be overwhelmed by the pace of warming. This study underscores the importance of realistic experimental simulations in evaluating species' thermal tolerance and highlights the potential for climate change to differentially impact populations along large latitudinal gradients."
Evolutionary Biology,Outer membrane changes enable evolutionary escape from bacterial predation,"Subham,Sarah-Luise,Ove Christopher,Saskia,Rolf,Simona G.,Subham,Sarah-Luise,Ove Christopher,Saskia,Rolf,Simona G.,Subham,Sarah-Luise,Ove Christopher,Saskia,Rolf","To combat antimicrobial resistant pathogens, natural predatory bacteria, like Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, represent potential alternatives. B. bacteriovorus could be particularly potent as it kills a broad range of human bacterial pathogens, however, it remains unclear whether prey can evolve genetically-determined resistance against predation. Here, we show that the model bacterium Escherichia coli K-12 consistently evolves resistance against B. bacteriovorus during experimental evolution. Selection for resistance scaled positively with predation pressure and was widespread after two cycles of predator exposure. Like antibiotics, predation resistance was costly, manifesting in a trade-off between predation resistance and fitness in the absence of predators. Genetic analysis identified changes in outer membrane porin OmpF as common resistance mechanism, while a mutation in cell envelope lipopolysaccharide-modifying enzyme WaaF was rarer but also conferred predation resistance. Our study uncovers evolutionary and mechanistic aspects of prey escape from predation, generating important knowledge on predator-prey interactions and to advance sustainable treatments."
Ecology,Dexrazoxane as a viable microsporidia control agent in ,"Tiago G.,Luis M.,Tiago G.,Luis M.,Tiago G.","Microsporidia have long been proposed as biological agents for controlling disease vectors and the parasites they transmit. However, their study in vector biology has been constrained due to challenges in manipulating microsporidia within hosts. In this study, we investigated the effect of Dexrazoxane, a candidate drug against microsporidiosis, on the establishment and development of , infection in its natural host, the mosquito ,, the main malaria vector. Our findings show that Dexrazoxane significantly reduces spore load, particularly in mosquitoes reared individually, without affecting the overall infection success of the parasite. This result aligns with studies in ,, where Dexrazoxane inhibited new spore production without hindering initial spore integration into the host gut cells. Dexrazoxane's DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor mechanism likely explains its impact on mosquito development, as larvae exposed to the drug failed to emerge as adults. These findings highlight Dexrazoxane's potential as a viable tool for controlling microsporidia in adult mosquitoes and hope to enhance the study of mosquito-microsporidia interactions. Further research is required to explore its broader application in vector-borne disease control, including malaria."
Ecology,Soil microarthropod community assembly at the micro spatial scale - A microcosm manipulation study,"Tara,Thomas,Tara,Thomas,Tara","Our understanding of soil microarthropod (Acari and Collembola) community assembly and dynamics is somewhat limited compared to aboveground communities. Understanding the processes involved in assembly and the spatial scales at which they occur would help answer the age old question of how so many species and individuals can coexist in soil.  We use  a microcosm experiment using intact soil cores to explore the processes of selection and dispersal taking place at the micro-spatial scale. We do this by manipulating available pore space and population density, which allows us to indirectly investigate the role of dispersal and biotic interactions in shaping microarthropod community dynamics. Results suggest that there are processes limiting abundance and that communities are sometimes held at abundances below those which the environment could accommodate by abiotic factors. Food and space did not appear to drive the observed patterns; however, findings suggest that abiotic factors may influence dynamics in the field."
Ecology,Are protected areas tracking threats to terrestrial biodiversity?,"Katherine,Carsten,Jonas,Katherine,Carsten,Jonas,Katherine,Carsten","Protected areas (PAs) are vital for nature conservation, yet evidence shows that pressure on biodiversity is increasing despite their global expansion. Using threat probability maps based on the IUCN Red List and PA data, we analyzed the relationship between PA coverage and the major threats: agriculture, hunting, logging, pollution, invasive species, and urbanization affecting amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles. Our analysis includes data on 33,379 species and 255,848 protected sites. Our results reveal a potential disconnect between global PAs and threat tracking, often leaving high threat areas insufficiently protected. Over half of the mapped area for amphibians and mammals faces high threat impact probability and insufficient PA cover. Amphibians face the highest proportion of high simultaneous threats and lack sufficient cover. Areas facing a high probability of impact lacking sufficient PA cover also harbor the highest proportion of threatened species across all taxonomic groups. Our research provides crucial insights into the current state of terrestrial PAs concerning threats, highlighting areas requiring immediate attention and guiding strategic conservation planning."

While interspecific comparisons have suggested selective pressures against large genomes, intraspecific variation has been less explored. Here, we investigate genome size variation within the hexaploid yellowcress herb, Rorippa indica, by integrating flow cytometry, plastomic phylogeography, genomic repeat profiling, and reciprocal common garden experiments. We analyzed 192 accessions from 83 natural populations, revealing a 128 Mb range in genome size. Plastome haplotype analysis identified a haplogroup that shifted niches to tropics and evolved larger genomes. A strong correlation was found between larger genomes and tropical habitats characterized by higher temperatures and lower seasonality. Genomic repeat content, particularly 45S rDNA and Ty1-copia transposable elements, was associated with larger genomes. Reciprocal transplantation experiments confirmed the adaptive nature of large genomes in tropical environments, with individuals exhibiting lower growth rates but higher fecundity. Our findings support the large genome selection hypothesis, suggesting that genome size enlargement, driven by genomic repetitive elements, can be an adaptive response to high temperatures of tropics. As global warming continues, plants with larger genomes may exhibit slower growth but increased reproductive output, potentially impacting ecosystem dynamics and agricultural productivity."
Evolutionary Biology,Global genetic rewiring during compensatory evolution in the yeast polarity network,"Enzo,Liedewij,Enzo,Liedewij,Enzo","Functional defects resulting from deleterious mutations can often be restored during evolution by compensatory mutations elsewhere in the genome. Importantly, this process can generate the genetic diversity seen in networks regulating the same biological function in different species. How the options for compensatory evolution depend on the molecular interactions underlying these functions is currently unclear. In this study, we investigate how gene deletions compensating for a defect in the polarity pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae impact the fitness landscape. Using a transposon mutagenesis screen, we demonstrate that gene fitness has changed on a genome-wide scale in the compensated strain. An analysis of the functional associations between the affected genes reveals that compensation impacts cellular processes that have no clear connection to cell polarity. Moreover, genes belonging to the same process tend to show the same direction of gene fitness change, indicating that compensation rewires the fitness contribution of cellular processes rather than of individual genes. In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that functional overlap between modules and the interconnectedness of the molecular interaction network play major roles in mediating compensatory evolution."

This study investigates the genomic adaptations associated with the evolution of the ambrosia lifestyle across multiple fungal lineages. We performed comparative genomic analyses on 70 fungal genomes from four families (Irpicaceae, Ceratocystidaceae, Nectriaceae, and Ophiostomataceae), including 24 ambrosia and 34 non-ambrosia lineages. Our phylogenomic analyses reveal multiple independent colonization of insect vectors by the fungi, spanning from the mid-Cretaceous (114.6 Ma) to the early Quaternary (1.9 Ma). Contrary to expectations for obligate symbionts, ambrosia fungi showed no significant genome-wide reductions in size, gene count, or secreted protein repertoire compared to their non-symbiotic relatives. Instead, we observed complex, lineage-specific patterns of genomic adaptation. Key findings include lineage-specific expansions in carbohydrate-active enzyme families (AA4 in Nectriaceae, CE4 in Ophiostomataceae, and GH3 in Ophiostomataceae and Ceratocystidaceae), suggesting potential enhancement or loss of lignin modification, hemicellulose deacetylation, and cellulose degradation in different ambrosia lineages. Repeat-Induced Point mutation analysis revealed family-specific patterns rather than lifestyle-associated differences. These results highlight the diverse genomic strategies employed by ambrosia fungi, demonstrating that symbiont evolution can proceed through refined, lineage-specific changes rather than genome-wide, or convergent alterations. Our study suggests that unlike other insect-farmed fungi, ambrosia fungi are not domesticated crops, but rather free-living fungi which co-opted wood boring beetles as vectors via subtle, lineage-specific adaptations."

The unique insights gained from a genome-level perspective have revealed a striking pattern of conserved macrosynteny within chromosomes across huge phylogenetic distances in animals, yet progress in many lineages has been hampered by the absence of genome-level data. Here, we show that the tectonics of genome evolution in clitellates, a clade composed of most freshwater and all terrestrial species of the phylum Annelida, is characterised by extensive genome-wide scrambling that resulted in a massive loss of macrosynteny between marine annelids and clitellates, to the point that ancient bilaterian linkage groups (ie, groups of genes inherited as a block in most bilaterian phyla) are fully disrupted. These massive rearrangements included the formation of putative neocentromeres with newly acquired transposable elements, and preceded a further period of genome-wide reshaping events including whole-genome duplications and massive macrosyntenic reshuffling between clitellate lineages, potentially triggered by the loss of genes involved in genome stability and homeostasis of cell division. Notably, while these rearrangements broke short-range interactions observed between Hox genes in marine annelids, they were reformed as long-range interactions in clitellates. These genomic rearrangements led to the relocation of genes and the formation of new chimeric genetic elements, both of which may have contributed to the adaptation of clitellates to freshwater and terrestrial environments. Our findings provide evidence of a massive genomic reshaping within clitellates at 2D and 3D levels, and suggest that synteny may not limit the structural evolution of this animal lineage. Our study thus suggests that the genomic landscape of Clitellata resulted from a rare burst of genomic changes that ended a long period of stability that persists across large phylogenetic distances."
Evolutionary Biology,Persistence of the ecological niche in pond damselflies underlies a stable adaptive zone despite varying selection,"Anjali,Erik I.,Henrik,Masahito,Anjali,Erik I.,Henrik,Masahito,Anjali,Erik I.,Henrik","Following the development of regression-based methods to estimate natural and sexual selection, evolutionary biologists have quantified the strength, mode and direction of selection in natural populations. Although this approach has been successful, its limitations include lack of replication across species, compromising the generality of the inferences beyond microevolutionary time scales. Here, we carried out a comparative study of selection on wing shape and body size across multiple populations of two closely related and ecologically similar pond damselflies: Enallagma cyathigerum and Ischnura elegans (Odonata: Coenagrionidae). We found weak stabilizing selection on wing shape in both sexes, and no evidence that selection on this trait differed between the species. In contrast, selection on body size was curvilinear in males and directional in females, and they differed in form (males) and intensity (females) between these two species. By analyzing selection on the fine-grained spatial scale, we found that selection on male body size was shaped by the local mating system, and the relationship between mating system characteristics and directional selection was remarkably consistent across these species. Finally, we present a graphical model that links contemporary selection and macroevolution. Based on this model, we conclude that the persistence in ecological modes of life in pond damselflies offers a plausible explanation for why varying selection in nature may still result in a stable adaptive zone lasting millions of years."
Evolutionary Biology,Diverse ancestries reveal complex symbiotic interactions during eukaryogenesis,"Moisès,Saioa,Marina,Toni,Moisès,Saioa,Marina,Toni,Moisès,Saioa,Marina","The origin of eukaryotes remains a central enigma in biology. Ongoing debates agree on the pivotal role of a symbiosis between an alpha-proteobacterium and an Asgard archaeon. However, the involvement of other bacterial partners as significant donors of genetic material, or the role of interactions with viruses remain contentious. To address these questions, we employed advanced phylogenomic approaches and comprehensive datasets spanning the known diversity of cellular life and viruses. Our analysis provided an updated reconstruction of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) proteome, in which we traced the phylogenetic origin of each protein family. We found compelling evidence for multiple waves of horizontal gene transfer from diverse bacterial and viral donors, with some likely preceding the mitochondrial endosymbiosis. We inferred the proteomes of the potential major donors and their functional contributions to LECA. Our findings underscore the contribution of horizontal gene transfers in shaping the proteomes of pre-LECA ancestors and hint to a facilitating role of Nucleocytoviricota viruses. Altogether, our results suggest ancient eukaryotes originated within complex microbial ecosystems through a succession of symbiotic interactions that left a footprint of horizontally transferred genes."

Over time, declines in infectious disease continue but chronic and degenerative causes persist,, so we might expect under-5 deaths to be concentrated in the first month of life. However, little is known about the age-pattern of this transition in early mortality or its potential limits. Here we first describe the limit using detailed data on Denmark, Japan, France, and the USA— developed countries with low under-5 mortality. The limiting pattern of under-5 deaths concentrates in the first month, but is surprisingly dispersed over later ages: we call this the early rectangularization of mortality. Then we examine the progress towards this limit of 31 developing countries from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)—the region with the highest under-5 mortality,. In these countries, we find that early deaths have large age-heterogeneities; and that the age patterns of death is an important marker of progress in the mortality transition at early ages. But a negative association between national income and under-5 mortality levels, confirmed here, does not help explain reductions in child mortality during the transition."

In Tasmanian devils, following the emergence of a fatal transmissible cancer, females started to breed precocially (i.e., at age one instead of typically age two) and the same time as populations started to decline following disease emergence. Here, we focus on a diseased site (Freycinet Peninsula, Tasmania, Australia) with 18 years of continuous mark-recapture data to test: (,) whether rates of precocial breeding in females continued to increase after the initial rise after the emergence of the disease, (,) whether there was a relationship between body size and breeding success for either one-year-olds or adult females (i.e., at least two-years-old), and (,) whether there was inbreeding depression in breeding success for either age category. We show that rates of precocial breeding did not continue to rise, and that the proportion of precocially breeding females has plateaued at around 50%. We also show that there was no effect of body size on the probability of breeding for either one-year-old or for adult females. Finally, we show that there was no evidence for inbreeding depression in breeding success for either age class. We discuss possible constraints that may have inhibited further rise in rates of precocial breeding in the context of limitations to growth in the offspring of precocially breeding (and therefore smaller) females."

Management and control of vector-borne disease require actual epidemiological data to better assess and anticipate the risk of (re)-emergence of tick-borne diseases in the region. To simplify and reduce the costs of such large-scale surveys, we implemented a high-throughput microfluidic real-time PCR system suitable for the screening of the main bacterial and parasitic genera involved in tick-borne disease and potentially circulating in the area. We used the new screening tool to perform an exploratory epidemiological study on 132 specimens of , and 446 of , collected in Guadeloupe and Martinique. Not only the system was able to detect the main pathogens of the area– ,, ,, ,, ,, ,– but the system also provided evidence of unsuspected microorganisms in Caribbean ticks, belonging to the ,, ,, , and , genera.

Ecology,Incorporating climatic extremes using the GEV distribution improves SDM range edge performance,"Ward,Josep Serra,Bart,Koenraad,Ward,Josep Serra,Bart,Koenraad,Ward,Josep Serra,Bart","Aim: The changing frequency and intensity of climatic extremes due to climate change can have sudden and adverse impacts on the distribution of species. While species distribution modelling is a vital tool in ecological applications, current approaches fail to fully capture the distribution of climatic extremes, particularly of rare events with the most disruptive potential. Especially at the edges of species' ranges, where conditions are already less favourable, predictions might be inaccurate when these extremes are not well represented.
Location: Europe.
Taxon: Tree species.
Methods: We present a novel approach to integrate extreme events into species distribution models based on the generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution. This distribution, following from the extreme value theory has been established as a valuable tool in analysing climatic extremes, both in an ecological context and beyond. The approach relying on the GEV distribution is broadly applicable, readily transferable across species and relies on widely available data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for 28 European tree species, illustrating its superior ability to fully capture the distribution of climatic extremes compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Results: We found that incorporating parameters on climatic extremes derived from the GEV distribution increased model performance (AICmodel) and characterized range edges more accurately (AUCedge) compared to competing approaches. However, general AUC values were only marginally increased across the species and study period analysed. Overall, the GEV model predicted a narrower niche for the species included in this study.
Main conclusions: Incorporating climatic extremes can impact spatial predictions of species distribution models, especially at range margins. We found that using the GEV distribution to characterise extreme variables in SDMs yields the best performance at these distribution edges. Given the importance of range edges for species conservation, a detailed inclusion of extremes in SDMs employed for those applications will help ensure robust conclusions."
Ecology,Amazonian biocultural heritage under climate change,"Rodrigo,Patrick R.,Jordi,Rodrigo,Patrick R.,Jordi,Rodrigo,Patrick R.","Amazonia harbors one fourth of the world's plant diversity and over 300 Indigenous groups. So far, however, no study has assessed how climate change may simultaneously impact its biological and cultural heritage. To bridge this gap, we assembled a database on 5,833 utilized plant species and show that climate change will reduce more the ranges of utilized than of non-utilized species by 2070. Locally, Indigenous cultures may lose an average of 65% of their utilized plant species and 50% of their associated services from climate change. Regionally, the loss of threatened languages may result in a 41% reduction in the Amazonian knowledge pool. Overall, our results point to the strong climate vulnerability of Amazonian biocultural heritage."

Extensive evidence now underscores the profound impact of species loss on the stability and dynamics of ecosystem functions. However, it remains unclear whether the loss of genetic diversity within key species yield similar consequences. Here, we delve into the intricate relationship between species diversity, genetic diversity, and ecosystem functions across three trophic levels (primary producers, primary consumers, and secondary consumers) in natural aquatic ecosystems. Our investigation involves estimating species diversity and genome-wide diversity (gauged within three pivotal species) within each trophic level, evaluating seven key ecosystem functions, and analyzing the strength of the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functions (BEFs). We found that, overall, the absolute effect size of genetic diversity on ecosystem functions mirrors that of species diversity in natural ecosystems. We nonetheless unveil a striking dichotomy: while genetic diversity was positively correlated with various ecosystem functions, species diversity displays a negative correlation with these functions. These intriguing antagonist effects of species and genetic diversity persists across the three trophic levels (underscoring its systemic nature), but were apparent only when BEFs were assessed within trophic levels rather than across them. This study reveals the complexity of predicting the consequences of genetic and species diversity loss under natural conditions, and emphasizes the need for further mechanistic models integrating these two facets of biodiversity."
Ecology,Annual Variability in Diffuse Ratio and Spectral Characteristics of Solar Radiation: Cloud Effects in a Temperate Monsoon Region,"Amila Nuwan,Atsushi,Amila Nuwan,Atsushi,Amila Nuwan","Solar radiation (SR) dynamics have a profound effect on plant growth, development, and ecosystems, and they act as a primary energy source and important environmental signal that plants perceive through their photoreceptors, which primarily sense critical wavelength ratios (CWRs). The diffuse fraction of solar radiation (DF) is a key factor affecting the quality and distribution of light within the plant canopy. We analyzed one year of SR spectral observations measured by a ground-based rotating shadow-band spectroradiometer to evaluate the potential effects of DF and CWRs on plants in an outdoor environment in Fukuoka, Japan. The daily mean DF and all considered CWRs showed significant seasonal variations regardless of the solar meridian altitude. Cloudy or partly cloudy skies were prevalent throughout the year. The ratios of ultraviolet-A (UV-A)/UV-B, red (R)/blue (B), and R/green (G) increased during winter and decreased during summer. Conversely, the ratios of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)/global solar radiation (GSI), UV/GSI, UV/PAR, B/G, R/far-red (FR), and UV-B/B increased during summer and decreased during winter. Most of the CWR correlated with DF. Furthermore, our study discovered a synergistic influence of air mass (AM), water vapor pressure (VP), and DF on specific CWRs, which play a crucial role in plant light signal processing. This highlights the potential influence of AM, VP, and DF on plant light signals, thereby opening avenues for developing innovative plant growth models and ecological responses incorporating plant photoreception."
Ecology,Origin of plant trait data matters: Shared species of Northwestern Europe and the Pannonian Ecoregion have different trait values in the two regions,"Judit,Péter,Judit,Péter,Judit","Trait-based ecology considerably increased our comprehension of various fields related to ecology and evolution. As measuring traits can be time-consuming and costly, analyses regularly gather trait data from databases instead of carrying out new measurements. However, intraspecific trait variability can cause considerable differences between the trait values of different population and regions. Here we evaluated whether intraspecific trait variability causes considerable differences in trait values measured in two different regions of Europe. We tested whether regionally measured trait data from the Pannonian Ecoregion differ from trait data of the same species originating from Northwestern Europe, by comparing data from the Pannonian Database of Plant Traits (PADAPT) and the LEDA Traitbase. We evaluated six traits of the same set of species: thousand-seed mass (TSM), seed bank persistence index (SBPI), leaf area (LA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf dry mass. We found that trait data from the two databases significantly differed for TSM, SBPI, SLA, and LDMC. Our results indicate that the markedly different climate of the two regions can cause substantial intraspecific trait variation, therefore, the geographical origin of trait data matters in trait-based analyses. The findings corroborate the assumption that regionally measured trait data and building regional databases are essential for reliable regional-scale trait-based studies. We conclude that for studies analysing traits in the Pannonian Ecoregion (and possibly in Easter and Central Europe in general), it is advisable to use PADAPT instead of databases compiling data from regions with markedly different climatic conditions."
Ecology,Competition for food affects the strength of reproductive interference and its consequences for species coexistence.,"Miguel A.,Oscar,Inês,Vitor C.,Sara,Flore,Miguel A.,Oscar,Inês,Vitor C.,Sara,Flore,Miguel A.,Oscar,Inês,Vitor C.,Sara","Competition for food and reproductive interference (negative interspecific sexual interactions) have been identified as major drivers of species exclusion. Still, how these biotic interactions jointly determine competitive dominance remains largely unknown. We tackle this by coupling population models and laboratory experiments with two spider mite sibling species. Using experiments specifically designed to measure the single and combined effects of food competition and reproductive interference, we first show that the strength and symmetry of reproductive interference between species changes in presence of food competition. Next, we show that population models incorporating each type of interaction alone or their effects when combined lead to markedly different predictions, from exclusion by one species or the other, to exclusion of the less abundant species. Moreover, accounting for the observed reduction in the strength of reproductive interference in the presence of food competition changes the threshold frequency determining the dominant competitor, favouring the superior competitor for food. Finally, model predictions for short-term population dynamics were corroborated with an independent population cage experiment. Altogether, our results suggest that trophic interactions can modulate sexual interactions, significantly impacting population dynamics and competitive outcomes. Hence, the joint consideration of food competition and reproductive interference is critical to accurately predict and understand species coexistence."
Ecology,The future abundance of key bird species for pathogen transmission in the Netherlands,"Martha,Henk,Peter M,Maarten JJ,Gertjan,Martha,Henk,Peter M,Maarten JJ,Gertjan,Martha,Henk,Peter M,Maarten JJ","Wild birds serve as reservoirs and vectors for many different pathogens and changes in their distribution and abundance due to environmental change will influence disease risk. We study three species which are highly abundant in north-western Europe and which can transmit a wide range of diseases including avian influenza and West Nile virus: blackbirds, mallards and house sparrows. Using the Netherlands as a case study, we created random forest models for predicting the distribution and abundance of these species, both now and in the future. Climate, land use and vegetative cover were all important predictors of bird abundance. The three species had different spatial distributions, largely related to their preferred habitat and food availability. In the future, mallard and house sparrow populations were predicted to increase, while there was little change for blackbirds. Quantifying the consequences of these abundance changes is complicated as there are many factors to consider, however increased pathogen reservoirs will likely increase disease risk and changes in distribution may affect local outbreak risk. The future abundance maps created in this study, and the methods used to create them, will be useful tools for disease modellers and policymakers to estimate future disease risk and to plan accordingly."
Ecology,General mechanisms for a top-down origin of the predator-prey power law,"Onofrio,Matthieu,Matteo,Onofrio,Matthieu,Matteo,Onofrio,Matthieu","The ratio of predator-to-prey biomass density is not constant along ecological gradients: denser ecosystems tend to have fewer predators per prey, following a scaling relation known as the ""predator-prey power law"". The origin of this surprisingly general pattern, particularly its connection with environmental factors and predator-prey dynamics, is unknown. Here, we explore some ways that a sublinear predator-prey scaling could emerge from density-dependent interactions among predators and between predators and prey (which we call a top-down origin), rather than among prey (bottom-up origin) as proposed in Hatton , (2015). We combine two complementary theoretical approaches. First, we use phenomenological differential equations to explore the role of environmental parameters and dynamical properties in controlling the predator-prey ratio. Second, we simulate an agent-based model with tunable predator self-regulation to investigate the emergence of predator-prey scaling from plausible microscopic rules. While we cannot rule out alternative explanations, our results show that density-dependent mechanisms relative to predation and intraspecific predator interactions, including prey saturation, predator interference, and predator self-regulation, offer potential explanations for the predator-prey power law."

We investigated range expansion into the CCE and correlations with environment for a group of tropical/sub-tropical seabirds. We assessed changes in the abundance (2002-2022) of five species from the genus, Sula (Cocos, Blue-footed, Red-footed, Masked, and Nazca Boobies), using a novel compilation of four data sources (at-sea surveys, n=82 observations, records from Southeast Farallon Island, n=600, the California Rare Birds Committee, n=593, and eBird -a citizen science mobile application, n= 20,529), and looked for relationships with the environment, including broad temporal and spatial scale dynamics (El Niño Southern Oscillation), local conditions where the bird was reported, and potential source conditions from Baja California Sur and the Gulf of California. All five species increased in abundance, and all, with the exception of Blue-footed, exhibited a northward range expansion by as much as 6.8 degrees latitude and increased range area of between 235-1013% within the CCE. There was increased abundance during warmer conditions (El Niño and warm SST) for Cocos, Red-footed, Masked, and Nazca Boobies, and all species increased by 692-3015% after the extreme marine heatwaves that began in late 2013. Our results document a tropical shift in seabirds of the CCE, which may present future challenges to resident species. As marine heatwaves are projected to increase in frequency and intensity, in addition to long-term warming, we hypothesize that these species will continue to expand their range northward in the CCE."

Here we present an updated systematic review of cross-sectional malaria surveys to explore the prevalence and drivers of these submicroscopic infections and define where they are likely to be relevant to malaria control efforts. Our results show that submicroscopic infections predominate in low transmission settings, but also reveal marked geographical variation in their prevalence, being highest in South American surveys and lowest in West African studies. Whilst current transmission levels partly explain these results, we find that historical transmission intensity also represents a crucial determinant of the size of the submicroscopic reservoir. Submicroscopic infection was more likely in adults than children, although we did not observe a statistically significant influence of seasonality. Our results suggest that the contribution of submicroscopic infections to transmission likely varies substantially across settings, potentially warranting different approaches to their targeting in the approach to elimination."

Genomic data can provide insights into the adaptation of invasive species through Genotype-Environment Association (GEA) studies, identifying genes and biological processes associated with invasion success, and more globally to estimate genetic (mal)adaptation to new environments by calculating Genomic Offset (GO) statistics. In this study, we investigate genetic adaptation in the invasive crop pest , using novel genomic resources and statistical methods. We rely on a new chromosome-level genome assembly and a dataset representing 36 populations, combining both publicly available and newly generated pooled and individual sequencing data, which are analyzed using an enhanced version of the BayPass software, tailored for such hybrid datasets. We identify a limited number of genomic regions associated with invasion success, supporting the hypothesis of a polygenic architecture of the underlying adaptive traits. Using a GEA incorporating 28 environmental covariates, we further estimate GO between source environments and invaded areas to gain insight into the adaptive challenges faced by , during past invasions. Reciprocally, we estimate GO between putative source environments and geographic areas that have not yet been invaded to predict regions at risk for potential future invasions. Finally, we used GO calculation to identify high risk regions from which pre-adapted populations could likely originate. Our results suggest that the adaptive challenge for , populations to invade their current major invasion range was limited. We also identified uninvaded regions (in Africa, South America, and Australia) as being at high risk of future invasion. While further sampling and more extensive individual sequencing could refine these conclusions, our study provides important insights into , adaptation and offers a generic and operational population genomics framework for studying and predicting biological invasions that can be applied to diverse species."

In dioecious plants, the former frequently occurs, while the latter is rarely reported. Here, we assembled four haplotype-resolved chromosome-level genomes from four lineages of the Salix polyclona complex, including three diploids (E, E-TS, and W1) and one autotetraploid (W2). Our analyses reveal that diploids have a ZW/ZZ system, while autotetraploid has a ZZZW/ZZZZ system on chromosome 15. The apical sex-determining genes of Salicaceae, ARR17-like duplicates on chromosomes 15 and 19, which can indirectly turn-on/off the expression of PISTILLATA (PI) gene and determine sex, appears to have lost the function of sex determination in the S. polyclona complex. We found a novel sex determining factor on the 15W of the complex, namely partial PI-like duplicates, which has taken over the function from the ARR17-like duplicates. In conclusion, a new dominant sex-determining gene was recruited in the S. polyclona complex, replacing the ancestral apical sex-determining ARR17-like duplicates. The newly identified partial PI-like duplicates exhibit a direct influence on the downstream intact PI-like duplications, providing valuable insights into the evolutionary trajectory of the top-down sex determination pathway."
Evolutionary Biology,Thermodynamic consistency of autocatalytic cycles,"Thomas,Denis,Etienne,Sylvain,Thomas,Denis,Etienne,Sylvain,Thomas,Denis,Etienne","Autocatalysis is seen as a potential key player in the origin of life, and perhaps more generally in the emergence of Darwinian dynamics. Building on recent formalizations of this phenomenon, we tackle the computational challenge of exhaustively detecting autocatalytic cycles in reactions networks, and further evaluate the impact of thermodynamic constraints on their realization under mass action kinetics. We first characterize the complexity of the detection problem by proving its NP-completeness. This justifies the use of constraint solvers to list all autocatalytic cycles in a given reaction network, and also to group them into compatible sets, composed of cycles whose stoichiometric requirements are not contradictory. Crucially, we show that the introduction of thermodynamic realism does constrain the composition of these sets. Compatibility relationships among cycles can indeed be disrupted when the reaction kinetics obey thermodynamic consistency throughout the network. On the contrary, these constraints have no impact on the realizability of isolated cycles, unless upper or lower bounds are imposed on the concentrations of the reactants. Overall, by better characterizing the conditions of autocatalysis in complex reaction systems, this work brings us a step closer to assessing the contribution of this collective chemical behavior to the emergence of natural selection in the primordial soup."
Ecology,Evaluating Plant-Microbe Associations in Response to Environmental Stressors to Enhance Salt Marsh Restoration,"Kai A,Mary-Margaret S,Rachel K,Ariane L,Kai A,Mary-Margaret S,Rachel K,Ariane L,Kai A,Mary-Margaret S,Rachel K","Microorganisms can enhance nutrient acquisition or suppress diseases from pathogens, while plants can provide carbon resources and oxygen to root-associated microbes. However, human activities have altered nutrient cycles and disrupted such mutualisms. Therefore, we need to understand how to promote positive plant-microbe associations to aid in restoring coastal wetland ecosystems where human stressors and climate change (e.g., hurricanes, sea-level rise) challenge restoration outcomes. This study seeks to examine how salinity stressors influence plant-microbe relationships, where we hypothesize that the presence of microbes will buffer salinity stressor effects. We used a whole sediment inocula approach to test this hypothesis. We exposed marsh cordgrass (Sporobolus alterniflorus) plugs to a replicated factorial experiment with three levels of microbiome addition (microbial inocula, autoclaved microbial inocula, no microbe control) and two levels of salinity (<0.5 psu, 20 psu), replicated ten times. We added microbial inocula from the marsh site with autoclaved soilless media and exposed half the plugs to saltwater (20 psu) and half to freshwater (<0.5 psu). Results revealed that marsh microbial inocula additions during early plant development may ameliorate salinity stressors and could be critical for future restoration efforts. The addition of marsh microbial inocula provided a rescue effect from salinity stress, observed in plant height and aboveground biomass. Belowground biomass, bacterial diversity, and bacterial evenness were similar across microbial and water treatments (ANOVA, NS); however, the main effects of water (PERMANOVA, R2=0.100, P<0.001) and microbial (PERMANOVA, R2=0.086, P<0.001) treatments significantly influenced the bacterial community composition. This work provides evidence that microbial stewardship is essential for buffering against environmental stressors and could promote plant establishment for wetland restoration."
Ecology,Oxygen deprivation implicated in rapid coral mortality — an emerging perilous threat to coral reefs,"Max Sascha,Shannon Grace,Anieka Janice,Alessandro,Carlos M.,Manuel,Max Sascha,Shannon Grace,Anieka Janice,Alessandro,Carlos M.,Manuel,Max Sascha,Shannon Grace,Anieka Janice,Alessandro,Carlos M.","Tropical coral reefs are undergoing unprecedented degradation,, primarily due to the increasing intensity and frequency of marine heatwaves with climate change,. Coral bleaching is a well–known ramification of marine heatwaves, but rapid coral mortality is an emerging paradigm that visually manifests as the ′sloughing′ of tissue from the coral skeleton. Unlike coral bleaching, coral tissue sloughing precludes any prospect of holobiont recovery beyond the initial onset,, indicating a life–or–death tipping point. Here, we experimentally confirm this phenomenon occurs when temperatures increase within temporal windows of hours to days, consistent with field observations,. Through microscale measurements of dissolved oxygen in the diffusive boundary layers of two abundant, keystone reef–building corals, we demonstrate that rapid temperature increases coincide with intrinsic oxygen deprivation, occurring before gross tissue disintegration or coral tissue sloughing. We propose that this distinct phenomenon arises from rapid heating, rendering the coral holobiont incapable of engaging in reactive processes to counteract the combined effects of heightened aerobic demands and impaired photosynthetic function. The passive diffusion of O, from the surrounding bulk water is likely insufficient to meet the holobiont's requirements, as explained by the Einstein–Smoluchowski kinetic theory of gases and Brownian motion,. These insights into coral tissue sloughing underscore the complexity of holobiont responses to stress and biophysical consequences of heatwaves. A granular understanding of these mechanisms is urgently needed, particularly regarding how heating rates may change under future climate scenarios, to re-evaluate the potentially under–recognised threats facing coral reefs."

The food web is comprised of 1809 nodes, representing 1845 taxa, and 13,222 links representing trophic interactions between nodes. While only 670 links represent parasitic interactions, we have assembled possibly the most speciose parasite-inclusive food web ever published. The inclusion of all nodes and links are justified using multiple lines of evidence which are built into the dataset. In addition, metadata, including trophic strategy, taxonomic information, habitat, and other ecological attributes allow the data user to filter the food web to their specifications.

Our food web can be used to predict how complex ecosystems like the California rocky intertidal will respond to anthropogenic change and management strategies."
Ecology,Saving the Dinaric lynx: multidisciplinary monitoring and stakeholder engagement support large carnivore restoration in human-dominated landscape,"Miha,Ursa,Rok,Lan,Marjeta,Aleksandra,Tomaz,Seth,Bernarda,Jaka,Tomislav,Tilen,Jakub,Pavel,Meta,Anja,Paolo,Elena,Hubert,Teodora,Magda,Ira,Teresa,Miha,Ursa,Rok,Lan,Marjeta,Aleksandra,Tomaz,Seth,Bernarda,Jaka,Tomislav,Tilen,Jakub,Pavel,Meta,Anja,Paolo,Elena,Hubert,Teodora,Magda,Ira,Teresa,Miha,Ursa,Rok,Lan,Marjeta,Aleksandra,Tomaz,Seth,Bernarda,Jaka,Tomislav,Tilen,Jakub,Pavel,Meta,Anja,Paolo,Elena,Hubert,Teodora,Magda,Ira","Translocations are central to large carnivore restoration efforts, but inadequate monitoring often inhibits effective conservation decision-making. Extinctions, reintroductions, poaching and high inbreeding levels of the Central European populations of Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) typify the carnivore conservation challenges in the Anthropocene. Recently, several conservation efforts were initiated to improve the genetic and demographic status, but were met with variable success. Here, we report on a successful, stakeholder-engaged translocation effort to reinforce the highly-inbred Dinaric lynx population and create a new stepping-stone subpopulation in the Southeastern Alps. We used multidisciplinary and internationally-coordinated monitoring using systematic camera-trapping, non-invasive genetic sampling, GPS-tracking of translocated and remnant individuals, recording of reproductive events and interspecific interactions, as well as the simultaneous tracking of the public and stakeholder support of carnivore conservation before, during and after the translocation process across the three countries. Among the 22 translocated wild-caught Carpathian lynx, 68% successfully integrated into the population and local ecosystems and at least 59% reproduced. Probability of dispersing from the release areas was 3-times lower when soft-release rather than hard-release method was used. Translocated individuals had lower natural mortality, higher reproductive success and similar ungulate kill rates compared to the remnant lynx. Cooperation with local hunters and protected area managers enabled us to conduct multi-year camera-trapping and non-invasive genetic monitoring across a 12,000-km2 transboundary area. Results indicate a reversal in population decline, as the lynx abundance increased for >40% during the 4-year translocation period. Effective inbreeding decreased from 0.32 to 0.08-0.19, suggesting a 2- to 4-fold increase in fitness. Furthermore, successful establishment of a new stepping-stone subpopulation represents an important step towards restoring the Central European lynx metapopulation. Robust partnerships with local communities and hunters coupled with transparent communication helped maintain high public and stakeholder support for lynx conservation throughout the translocation process. Lessons learned about the importance of stakeholder involvement and multidisciplinary monitoring conducted across several countries provide a successful example for further efforts to restore large carnivores in human-dominated ecosystems."
Epidemiology,Cross-scale dynamics and the evolutionary emergence of infectious diseases,"Sebastian J.,Ruian,Claude,Miran,Prianna,James O.,Sebastian J.,Ruian,Claude,Miran,Prianna,James O.,Sebastian J.,Ruian,Claude,Miran,Prianna","When emerging pathogens encounter new host species for which they are poorly adapted, they must evolve to escape extinction. Pathogens experience selection on traits at multiple scales, including replication rates within host individuals and transmissibility between hosts. We analyze a stochastic model linking pathogen growth and competition within individuals to transmission between individuals. Our analysis reveals a new factor, the cross-scale reproductive number of a mutant virion, that quantifies how quickly mutant strains increase in frequency when they initially appear in the infected host population. This cross-scale reproductive number combines with viral mutation rates, single-strain reproductive numbers, and transmission bottleneck width to determine the likelihood of evolutionary emergence, and whether evolution occurs swiftly or gradually within chains of transmission. We find that wider transmission bottlenecks facilitate emergence of pathogens with short-term infections, but hinder emergence of pathogens exhibiting cross-scale selective conflict and long-term infections. Our results provide a framework to advance the integration of laboratory, clinical and field data in the context of evolutionary theory, laying the foundation for a new generation of evidence-based risk assessment of emergence threats."
Cancer Biology,TGF-β induces an atypical EMT to evade immune mechanosurveillance in lung adenocarcinoma dormant metastasis,"Zhenghan,Yassmin,Ines,Lila,George,Yanyan,Joao,Morgan,Joan,Zhenghan,Yassmin,Ines,Lila,George,Yanyan,Joao,Morgan,Joan,Zhenghan,Yassmin,Ines,Lila,George,Yanyan,Joao,Morgan","The heterogeneity of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programs is manifest in the diverse EMT-like phenotypes occurring during tumor progression. However, little is known about the mechanistic basis and functional role of specific forms of EMT in cancer. Here we address this question in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells that enter a dormancy period in response to TGF-β upon disseminating to distant sites. LUAD cells with the capacity to enter dormancy are characterized by expression of SOX2 and NKX2-1 primitive progenitor markers. In these cells, TGF-β induces growth inhibition accompanied by a full EMT response that subsequently transitions into an atypical mesenchymal state of round morphology and lacking actin stress fibers. TGF-β induces this transition by driving the expression of the actin-depolymerizing factor gelsolin, which changes a migratory, stress fiber-rich mesenchymal phenotype into a cortical actin-rich, spheroidal state. This transition lowers the biomechanical stiffness of metastatic progenitors, protecting them from killing by mechanosensitive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. Inhibiting this actin depolymerization process clears tissues of dormant metastatic cells. Thus, LUAD primitive progenitors undergo an atypical EMT as part of a strategy to evade immune-mediated elimination during dormancy. Our results provide a mechanistic basis and functional role of this atypical EMT response of LUAD metastatic progenitors and further illuminate the role of TGF-β as a crucial driver of immune evasive metastatic dormancy."
Cancer Biology,In vitro models to mimic tumor endothelial cell-mediated immune cell reprogramming in lung adenocarcinoma,"Morgane,Judith,Emilie,Virginie,Marine,Valentin,Hortense,Camille,Vincent,David,Nicolas,Richard,Isabelle,Christophe,Lucas,Morgane,Judith,Emilie,Virginie,Marine,Valentin,Hortense,Camille,Vincent,David,Nicolas,Richard,Isabelle,Christophe,Lucas,Morgane,Judith,Emilie,Virginie,Marine,Valentin,Hortense,Camille,Vincent,David,Nicolas,Richard,Isabelle,Christophe","Tumor endothelial (TECs) cells play a critical role in regulating immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the mechanisms by which TECs modulate immune cell population remain unclear, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we investigated how NSCLC cells tweak normal endothelial cells (NECs) into TECs and the subsequent effects on immune regulation. NECs were cocultured with various NSCLC cell lines, using 2D and 3D coculture models to evaluate TEC-mediated effects on immune cells. We show that direct coculture led to significant transcriptomic, proteomic and kinomic alterations in TECs, especially in pro-inflammatory pathways. We identified a downregulation of the co-stimulatory molecule OX40L in TECs compared to NECs, suggesting impaired T-cell proliferation support. While TECs showed a limited effect on CD8+ T-cell activation, TECs supported CD4 T-cells polarization into Treg and Th22 subsets. Moreover, TECs also promoted M2-like macrophages polarization, thereby potentially contributing to the TME immunosuppression. State-of-the-art single-cell RNA sequencing of 3D multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) revealed distinct TEC subpopulations, including an inflammatory subset with UPR signature. The latter was absent in 2D-cultured NECs but present in freshly isolated and 2D-cultured TECs from NSCLC patients. Importantly, we also identified within MCTS a perivascular M2-like macrophage subset, predicted to interact with TECs with MIF and Midkine signaling. In conclusion, TECs in NSCLC tumors play a pivotal role in remodeling the TME immune landscape by promoting immune suppression. This study highlights the complex immunoregulatory functions of TECs within our different in vitro models that mimic aspects of the TME. Our data may provide new insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting TECs or regulatory signaling to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in NSCLC."
Ecology,Detecting ecosystem trends in response to climate and disturbance across continental plot networks: a power analysis,"Greg R,Irene,Rachael V,Samantha E.M.,Ben,Greg R,Irene,Rachael V,Samantha E.M.,Ben,Greg R,Irene,Rachael V,Samantha E.M.","Plant communities are dynamic: cyclical, directional and stochastic changes in species composition make interpretation of responses complex. The multi-dimensionality of ecological change is reduced by ecosystem indicators that quantify functional responses to environmental drivers. However, thresholds of detectable change in indicators may vary by ecosystem or the spatial configuration of monitoring sites within regions.
We quantified the power of a continental terrestrial ecosystem plot network (TERN Ausplots, Australia) to detect change in ecological indicators linked to disturbance and climate: community temperature index (CTI), proportional abundance of photosynthetic pathways (C4%), and species abundance distribution (SAD). We simulated trend and noise scenarios and calculated power and effect size across spatial clusters of plots using linear mixed effects models. We then assessed factors that influenced change detection capacity. Power varied substantially across the network. Trends with a minimum magnitude of 0.5-3.0 degrees Celsius in CTI, 0.01-0.3 in C4% and 0.1-0.5 in the SAD sigma were detectable, depending on cluster identity and noise. Increased plot replication within a spatial cluster increased power and lower variance among baseline replicates increased effect size for CTI and C4% but not SAD. Latitudinal patterns in change detection capacity emerged for CTI and C4%. The effect size of increasing CTI was greater in the tropics due to lower among-plot variance, while power to detect increasing C4% was higher in the temperate south, where C4 is rare. Indicators reveal trends in complex ecological data that can inform decision-making. Increasing spatial replication and minimising spatial variation by stratifying plots to the same ecological community enhance change detection, albeit with different effectiveness by indicator. The results suggest change detection differs by location, irrespective of sampling factors such as number of plots. Strategies and thresholds for change detection may therefore apply unequally across environments and should be considered by region and response parameter."
Cancer Biology,DDX41 dissolves G-quadruplexes to maintain erythroid genome integrity and prevent cGAS-mediated cell death,"Honghao,Kehan,Pan,Ermin,Xu,Wen,Jing,Inci,Kara,Lucy,Yan,Vipul,Elizabeth,Yuefeng,Lionel,Madina,Peng,Honghao,Kehan,Pan,Ermin,Xu,Wen,Jing,Inci,Kara,Lucy,Yan,Vipul,Elizabeth,Yuefeng,Lionel,Madina,Peng,Honghao,Kehan,Pan,Ermin,Xu,Wen,Jing,Inci,Kara,Lucy,Yan,Vipul,Elizabeth,Yuefeng,Lionel,Madina","Deleterious germline DDX41 variants constitute the most common inherited predisposition disorder linked to myeloid neoplasms (MNs). The role of DDX41 in hematopoiesis and how its germline and somatic mutations contribute to MNs remain unclear. Here we show that DDX41 is essential for erythropoiesis but dispensable for the development of other hematopoietic lineages. Using stage-specific Cre models for erythropoiesis, we reveal that Ddx41 knockout in early erythropoiesis is embryonically lethal, while knockout in late-stage terminal erythropoiesis allows mice to survive with normal blood counts. DDX41 deficiency induces a significant upregulation of G-quadruplexes (G4), noncanonical DNA structures that tend to accumulate in the early stages of erythroid precursors. We show that DDX41 co-localizes with G4 on the erythroid genome. DDX41 directly binds to and dissolves G4, which is significantly compromised in MN-associated DDX41 mutants. Accumulation of G4 by DDX41 deficiency induces erythroid genome instability, defects in ribosomal biogenesis, and upregulation of p53. However, p53 deficiency does not rescue the embryonic death of Ddx41 hematopoietic-specific knockout mice. In parallel, genome instability also activates the cGas-Sting pathway, which is detrimental to survival since cGas-deficient and hematopoietic-specific Ddx41 knockout mice are viable without detectable hematologic phenotypes, although these mice continue to show erythroid ribosomal defects and upregulation of p53. These findings are further supported by data from a DDX41 mutated MN patient and human iPSC-derived bone marrow organoids. Our study establishes DDX41 as a G4 dissolver, essential for erythroid genome stability and suppressing the cGAS-STING pathway."
Cancer Biology,Advantage of the F(ab)'2 fragment over IgG for RIT and PRIT,"Zainab Emma,Maya,Frederique,Catherine,Frederic,Sylvia,Francois,Zainab Emma,Maya,Frederique,Catherine,Frederic,Sylvia,Francois,Zainab Emma,Maya,Frederique,Catherine,Frederic,Sylvia","Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) has proved clinically effective in the treatment of relapsed or consolidating NHL after chemotherapy. However, it is still at the clinical trial stage for the treatment of solid tumors. The efficacy of the treatment on this type of tumor is limited by hematological toxicity, which restricts the activities injected. Pre-targeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT) enables radiolabeling to be carried out in vivo at a time when the quantities of antigen-targeted vector reach a maximum level in the tumor, but have largely decayed in the bloodstream, thus limiting hematological toxicity. This therapeutic approach would make it possible to use higher radiopharmaceutical activities than those used in RIT, thereby increasing the doses deposited in the tumor and the therapeutic response. Despite encouraging preclinical trials, this approach has failed to live up to expectations in terms of clinical applications. In the context of PRIT using the Inverse Electron Demand Diels Alder (IEDDA) reaction as a method for radiolabeling tumor-targeted vectors, a major research effort has been made to improve the quality of in vivo radiolabeling using tetrazine (Tz) and transcycloctene (TCO) variants whose stability and reactivity have been optimized. Most trials in this field have been carried out using antibodies which, thanks to their long biological half-life, enable prolonged irradiation of tumors. Low-molecular-weight vectors such as affinity proteins or antigen-specific antibody fragments (VHH,scFv, F(ab)' ) have the advantage of being rapidly eliminated from circulation by renal filtration, but on the other hand, the quantities and residence times of these vectors in the tumor are reduced compared with IgG. F(ab)'2 antibody fragments have properties intermediate between those of IgG and low-molecular-weight vectors that could be suitable for PRIT approaches, but they have not yet been evaluated in PRIT using IEDDA. In preparation for a preclinical trial of radioimmunotherapy of triple-negative breast cancer in spontaneously affected dogs, we compared the biodistribution of IgG and its F(ab)'2 fragment targeting canine CD138 in a xenogeneic model of canine breast cancer and in a mouse model of colon cancer expressing human ACE antigen. This analysis shows that the use of F(ab)'2 fragments improves the therapeutic index compared with IgG. F(ab)'2 fragments seem particularly well suited to tumor targeting in PRIT using short-lived isotopes such as 211At."
Cancer Biology,Chronic obesity does not alter cancer survival in ,"Ilaria,Zachary,Luca,Stefanos,Megan,Galen,John Andrew,Ilaria,Zachary,Luca,Stefanos,Megan,Galen,John Andrew,Ilaria,Zachary,Luca,Stefanos,Megan,Galen","Obesity is a complex chronic disease characterized by excessive adiposity and associations with numerous co-morbidities, including cancer. Despite extensive research, we have limited understanding of the mechanisms coupling obesity to cancer risk, and, of the contexts in which obesity does or does not exacerbate disease. Here, we show that chronic high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity has no significant effect on the , mouse, a model of human Li-Fraumeni multi-cancer syndrome. Surprisingly, despite inducing rapid and highly penetrant obesity and long-term differences in metabolic and adiposity, greater than one year of HFD had no significant effect on survival or tumor burden. These findings were replicated in two separate cohorts and thus provide important negative data for the field. Given strong publication bias against negative data in the literature, this large cohort study represents a clear case where chronic diet-induced obesity does not accelerate or aggravate cancer outcomes. The data thus carry high impact for researchers, funders, and policymakers alike."
Cancer Biology,Targeting the 3D genome by anthracyclines for chemotherapeutic effects,"Minkang,Shengnan,Yuchen,Andrea A.,Douglas H.,Liping,Baoxu,Minkang,Shengnan,Yuchen,Andrea A.,Douglas H.,Liping,Baoxu,Minkang,Shengnan,Yuchen,Andrea A.,Douglas H.,Liping","The chromatins are folded into three-dimensional (3D) structures inside cells, which coordinates the regulation of gene transcription by the non-coding regulatory elements. Aberrant chromatin 3D folding has been shown in many diseases, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and may contribute to tumorigenesis. The anthracycline topoisomerase II inhibitors can induce histone eviction and DNA damage. We performed genome-wide high-resolution mapping of the chemotherapeutic effects of various clinically used anthracycline drugs. ATAC-seq was used to profile the histone eviction effects of different anthracyclines. TOP2A ChIP-seq was used to profile the potential DNA damage regions. Integrated analyses show that different anthracyclines have distinct target selectivity on epigenomic regions, based on their respective ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq profiles. We identified the underlying molecular mechanism that unique anthracycline variants selectively target chromatin looping anchors via disrupting CTCF binding, suggesting an additional potential therapeutic effect on the 3D genome. We further performed Hi-C experiments, and data from K562 cells treated with the selective anthracycline drugs indicate that the 3D chromatin organization is disrupted. Furthermore, AML patients receiving anthracycline drugs showed altered chromatin structures around potential looping anchors, which linked to distinct clinical outcomes. Our data indicate that anthracyclines are potent and selective epigenomic targeting drugs and can target the 3D genome for anticancer therapy, which could be used for personalized medicine to treat tumors with aberrant 3D chromatin structures."
Cancer Biology,Nrf2 orchestrates epigenetic regulations and serves as the master regulator of KLF4 expression and activity during arsenic-induced transformation,"Ziwei,Zhuoyue,Jessica,Yiran,Wenxuan,Haoyan,John,Chitra,Fei,Ziwei,Zhuoyue,Jessica,Yiran,Wenxuan,Haoyan,John,Chitra,Fei,Ziwei,Zhuoyue,Jessica,Yiran,Wenxuan,Haoyan,John,Chitra","Emerging evidence suggests that Nrf2 plays a pro-carcinogenic role in cancer. Our previous study showed that arsenic-induced Nrf2 activation triggers metabolic reprogramming, leading to the formation of cancer stem-like cells. Here, we further demonstrated that KLF4, a key pluripotency factor, is a direct transcriptional target of Nrf2 in arsenic-exposed human bronchial epithelial cells. ChIP-seq analysis identified multiple Nrf2 binding peaks at the Klf4 gene locus, which overlap with the enhancer markers H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac. Nrf2 knockout reduced both KLF4 expression and enhancer marker enrichment, accompanied by a global decrease in KLF4 binding across the genome. In wild-type (WT) cells, arsenic treatment increased KLF4 binding on genes involved in oncogenic pathways such as STAT3, SOX2, Nrf2, cell growth, Hedgehog, and EMT. We also found that KLF4 engages in a self-feedback loop in response to Nrf2 signaling. Lastly, our data showed that the co-occupancy of Nrf2 and KLF4 is crucial for establishing active enhancer hubs in the genome. These findings suggest that the oncogenic effects of Nrf2 are, in part, mediated by Nrf2 dependent self-amplification of KLF4 expression and function. Thus, targeting both Nrf2 and KLF4 could be a promising therapeutic strategy for eliminating cancer stem-like cells."
Cancer Biology,Genomic Discovery of EF-24 Targets Unveils Antitumorigenic Mechanisms in Leukemia Cells,"Ajeet P,Noah,James,Ana,Jonathan,Ajeet P,Noah,James,Ana,Jonathan,Ajeet P,Noah,James,Ana","Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound derived from the plant , L., has demonstrated a wide range of therapeutic properties, including potential anticancer effects. However, its clinical efficacy is limited due to poor bioavailability and stability. To overcome these challenges, curcumin analogs like EF-24 have been developed with improved pharmacological properties. In this study, we used whole-transcriptome profiling to identify the genome-wide functional impacts of EF-24 treatment in leukemia cells to improve our understanding of its potential mechanisms of action. This approach allowed us to establish a model system for associating druggable genes with clinical disease targets. We used the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line K-562 and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines HL-60, Kasumi-1, and THP-1 to conduct EF-24 treatment studies. Cell viability was significantly decreased in the EF-24treated cells as compared to the untreated controls. We discovered that the genes ATF3, CLU, HSPA6, OSGIN1, ZFAND2A, and CXCL8, which are associated with reduced cell viability and proliferation, were consistently upregulated in all EF-24treated cell lines. Further analysis of the tested cell lines revealed the activation of various signaling pathways, including the STAT1 regulated S100 family signaling pathway, that controlled downstream gene expression in response to EF-24 treatment. Our results elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying EF-24's antitumor efficacy against leukemia, highlighting its multifaceted impact on signaling pathways and gene networks that regulate cell survival, proliferation, and immune responses in myeloid leukemia cells."

On 22 March 2018, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) released the documentary “Contagion! The BBC Four Pandemic” to describe the science behind pandemic preparedness in the UK. The authors of this article were responsible for producing a mathematical simulation for that documentary of how a highly contagious respiratory pathogen might spread across the UK. According to the documentary narrative, the ‘outbreak’ begins in the town of Haslemere, England. To ground the simulation in true human interaction patterns, a three-day citizen science experiment was conducted during which the pairwise distances between 469 volunteers in Haslemere were tracked continuously using a mobile phone app. Here, we offer a scientific companion to the documentary in which we describe the methods behind our simulation and release the pairwise interpersonal distance dataset. We discuss salient features of the dataset, including daily patterns in the clustering and volatility of interpersonal interactions. Our epidemiological analysis of the simulated Haslemere outbreak serves as a springboard to discuss scientific opportunities opened by the Haslemere dataset and others like it. We believe that the Haslemere dataset will productively challenge current strategies for incorporating population structure into disease transmission models, and hope that it will inspire the collection and analysis of other similar datasets in the future."

Individuals predominantly interact with a small number of close companions while maintaining weaker social bonds with less familiar group members. By incorporating this behaviour into a mathematical model we find that a single parameter, which we refer to as social fluidity, controls the rate of social mixing within the group. We compare the social fluidity of 13 species by applying the model to empirical human and animal social interaction data. To investigate how social behavior influences the likelihood of an epidemic outbreak we derive an analytical expression of the relationship between social fluidity and the basic reproductive number of an infectious disease. For highly fluid social behaviour disease transmission is revealed to be density-dependent. For species that form more stable social bonds, the model describes frequency-dependent transmission that is sensitive to changes in social fluidity."

Epidemiology,The role of “spillover” in antibiotic resistance,"Scott W.,Marc,Yonatan H.,Scott W.,Marc,Yonatan H.,Scott W.,Marc","Antibiotic use is a key driver of antibiotic resistance. Understanding the quantitative association between antibiotic use and resulting resistance is important for predicting future rates of antibiotic resistance and for designing antibiotic stewardship policy. However, the use-resistance association is complicated by “spillover”, in which one population’s level of antibiotic use affects another population’s level of resistance via the transmission of bacteria between those populations. Spillover is known to have effects at the level of families and hospitals, but it is unclear if spillover is relevant at larger scales. We used mathematical modeling and analysis of observational data to address this question. First, we used dynamical models of antibiotic resistance to predict the effects of spillover. Whereas populations completely isolated from one another do not experience any spillover, we found that if even 1% of interactions are between populations, then spillover may have large consequences: the effect of a change in antibiotic use in one population on antibiotic resistance in that population could be reduced by as much as 50%. Then, we quantified spillover in observational antibiotic use and resistance data from US states and European countries for 3 pathogen-antibiotic combinations, finding that increased interactions between populations were associated with smaller differences in antibiotic resistance between those populations. Thus, spillover may have an important impact at the level of states and countries, which has ramifications for predicting the future of antibiotic resistance, designing antibiotic resistance stewardship policy, and interpreting stewardship interventions."

Here, the results from more than 23 laboratories are presented. The primary purpose was to design experiments simulating typical casework circumstances; collect data and to implement Bayesian networks to assess the value (i.e., likelihood ratio) of DNA results given activity level propositions. Two different experimental designs were used to simulate a robbery, where a screwdriver was used to force a door or window. Propositions and case information were chosen following laboratory feedback listing typical casework circumstances (included in the paper). Whereas the proposition representing prosecution’s view is applicable to many cases: the defendant forced the door/window with his screwdriver; the proposition representing defence’s view are more variable depending on what is alleged to have happened. In a direct transfer experiment, the defendant owned and used the screwdriver, but he did not force the door/window in question. An unknown person used the defendant’s stolen screwdriver. In an indirect transfer experiment, the defendant neither owned, saw, nor used the screwdriver, nor did they force the door or window. Instead, an unknown individual—someone with whom the defendant had interacted (e.g., by shaking hands or touching the same objects)—used the recovered tool to force entry. In the first experiment, if the defendant forced the door/window, then s/he is the last handler of the screw driver, whereas if the tool was stolen and used by an unknown person, the defendant is the first handler. For the second experiment, given the defence view, the defendant never held the screwdriver. We envisaged the situation where an object manipulated by the defendant (or the defendant himself/herself) would be touched by the unknown offender who would then force the window. The time delay between the touching of the object and the forcing of the window was 0, 1h, and 2h. This was accomplished by handshaking experiments, where the person forcing the door would shake a person’s hand, and then use the screwdriver either immediately after handshake or after 1, 2 hours. It was found for the direct transfer experiment that unless a single contributor profile aligning with the known person’s of interest profile was retrieved, the results did not allow to discriminate propositions. On the other hand, for the indirect transfer experiment, both single and major contributor profiles that aligned with the person of interest (POI) supported the proposition that the person used the tool rather than an unknown person who had touched an object, when indeed the former was true. There was considerable variation in median recoveries of DNA between laboratories (between 200pg - 5ng) for a given experiment if quantities are taken into account. These differences affect the likelihood ratios given activity level propositions. More than 2,700 samples were analysed in the course of this study. Two different Bayesian Networks are made available via an open source application written in Shiny R: Shiny_React(). For comparison, all datasets were analysed using a qualitative method categorised into absent, single, balanced or major given contributors."

Currently, there are no disease-modifying therapies available for ALS4. Given that , is haplosufficient, removing the product of the mutated allele presents a potential therapeutic strategy. We designed a series of siRNAs to selectively target the RNA transcript from the ALS4 allele containing the c.1166T>C mutation (p.Leu389Ser). Transfection of HEK293 cells with siRNA and plasmids encoding either wild-type or mutant (Leu389Ser) epitope tagged SETX revealed that three siRNAs specifically reduced mutant SETX protein levels without affecting the wild-type SETX protein. In ALS4 primary fibroblasts, siRNA treatment silenced the endogenous mutant , allele, while sparing the wild-type allele, and restored R-loop levels in patient cells. Our findings demonstrate that mutant ,, differing from wild-type by a single nucleotide, can be effectively and specifically silenced by RNA interference, highlighting the potential of allele-specific siRNA as a therapeutic approach for ALS4."

Moreover, when one of this gene is mutated, complex chimeric gene conversion events associated to crossover are observed suggesting a role of these proteins in limiting the multiple strand invasions.

Genetics,A collection of split-Gal4 drivers targeting conserved signaling ligands in ,"Ben,Neha,Ashley Suraj,Tanuj,Jonathan,Norbert,Ben,Neha,Ashley Suraj,Tanuj,Jonathan,Norbert,Ben,Neha,Ashley Suraj,Tanuj,Jonathan","Communication between cells in metazoan organisms is mediated by a remarkably small number of highly conserved signaling pathways. Given the relatively small number of signaling pathways, the existence of multiple related ligands for many of these pathways is thought to represent a key evolutionary innovation for encoding complexity into cell-cell signaling. Relatedly, crosstalk and other interactions between pathways is another critical feature which allows a modest number pathways to ultimately generate an enormously diverse range of outcomes. It would thus be useful to have genetic tools to identify and manipulate not only those cells which express a given signaling ligand, but also those cells that specifically co-express pairs of signaling ligands. Here, we present a collection of split-Gal4 knock-in lines targeting many of the ligands for highly conserved signaling pathways in , (Notch, Hedgehog, FGF, EGF, TGF,, JAK/STAT, JNK, and PVR). We demonstrate that these lines faithfully recapitulate the endogenous expression pattern of their targets, and that they can be used to specifically identify the cells and tissues that co-express pairs of signaling ligands. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that the 4th chromosome TGF, ligands , and , are broadly co-expressed in muscles and other tissues of both larva and adults, and that the JAK/STAT ligands , and , are partially co-expressed from cells of the midgut following gut damage. Together with our previously collection of split-Gal4 lines targeting the seven Wnt ligands, this resource allows , researchers to identify and genetically manipulate cells that specifically express pairs of conserved ligands from nearly all the major intercellular signaling pathways."

Here, we report on a field trial aiming at the identification of ADB tolerant genotypes while encompassing the genetic diversity of common ash in Austria. Over 35,000 progenies from more than 600 putative tolerant mother trees were assessed for ADB symptoms over a period of three years. One tolerant and one susceptible progeny from a subset of the mother tree range (570 trees) were genotyped using the 4TREE array, a genotyping tool developed specifically to screen common ash provenances for their tolerance to ash dieback. We aimed to (1) better characterize the genetic structure of common ash in Austria, (2) identify hybrids between common ash and , (narrow-leaved ash), (3) detect genetic loci associated with tolerance to ADB, and (4) identify genetic variation associated with abiotic factors such as temperature and precipitation influencing the severity of ADB. We identify ash individuals from Eastern Austria matching putative hybrids with , showing varying degrees of , ancestry in structure analyses. The non-hybrid gene pool is characterized by shallow genetic structure following a west to east geographic pattern. In contrast to our expectations, genotype-damage association analyses overall fail to detect SNPs associated with tolerance to ADB. Our findings underscore that the polygenic architecture governing tolerance and the rapid decay of genomic linkage disequilibrium (LD) (within approximately 10 kb) significantly limit the ability to identify association outliers using the 4TREE SNP array. This highlights the constrained utility of chip genotyping approaches for this specific purpose. In contrast, the array proves successful in detecting hybrids between common ash and narrow-leaved ash, as well as outlier SNPs associated with abiotic predictors (such as annual precipitation and temperature) known to influence the severity of ADB damage."
Evolutionary Biology,Bacteria-phage (co)evolution is constrained in a synthetic community across multiple bacteria-phage pairs,"Meaghan,Daniel,Marli,Amy,Angus,Meaghan,Daniel,Marli,Amy,Angus,Meaghan,Daniel,Marli,Amy","Bacteriophages can be important drivers of bacterial densities, and therefore microbial community composition and function. These ecological interactions are likely to be greatly affected by evolutionary dynamics, because bacteria can rapidly evolve resistance to phage while phage can reciprocally evolve to increase infectivity. Most studies to date have explored eco-evolutionary dynamics using isolated pairs of bacteria-phage but in nature, multiple bacteria and phages coexist and (co)evolve simultaneously. How coevolution plays out in this context is poorly understood. Here, we examine how three coexisting soil bacteria (Ochrobactrum sp., Pseudomonas sp., and Variovorax sp.) interact and evolve with three species-specific bacteriophages over eight weeks of experimental evolution, both as host-parasite pairs in isolation and as a mixed community. Across all species phage resistance evolution was inhibited in polyculture, with the most pronounced effect on Ochrobactrum. Between bacteria-phage pairs there were also substantial differences in the effect of phage on host densities, and evolutionary dynamics including whether pairs coevolved. These contrasts emphasise the difficulty in generalising from monoculture to polyculture, and between bacteria-phage pairs to wider systems. Future studies should consider how multiple bacteria and phage pairs interact simultaneously to better understand how coevolutionary dynamics happen in natural communities."
Evolutionary Biology,Rapid promoter evolution of male accessory gland genes is accompanied by divergent expression in closely related ,"David W. J.,Frannie H. S.,Alexander D.,Roland,Alberto,Matthias,David W. J.,Frannie H. S.,Alexander D.,Roland,Alberto,Matthias,David W. J.,Frannie H. S.,Alexander D.,Roland,Alberto","Seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) are essential for reproductive success and evolve fast, possibly driven by post-copulatory sexual selection (PCSS) originating from sperm competition and cryptic female choice. Counterintuitively, however, the coding region only in few Sfps evolves adaptively. Hence, additional genomic and functional factors must play a role in Sfp evolution independent of the protein coding region. To shed light on drivers of Sfp evolution we focus on those Sfps predominantly expressed in male accessory glands, because this allows examination of their evolution in the tissue which produces the majority of Sfps. Moreover, accessory glands develop normally in hybrids in contrast to testis allowing to control for changes in cellular environment arising during speciation. Here, we discover that Acp promoters contain hot spots for rapid evolution from accumulation of sequence changes and insertions/deletions (indels). We further show that changes in promoter sequences are accompanied by gene expression divergence among closely related , species. We then validate these observations in , hybrids to show that species-specific expression divergence of Acps with rapidly evolving promoters are maintained in hybrids for some Acps, while others show dominance of one allele, a phenomenon termed transvection. These results indicate that cis-regulatory evolution, rather than genome background variation, drives Acp expression changes and promotes their rapid evolution."

Mutations in the , gene are associated with psychiatric disorders but how RBFOX1 influences psychiatric disorder vulnerability remains unclear. Recent studies showed that RBFOX1 mediates the alternative splicing of ,, a critical HPA axis activator. Further, RBFOX1 dysfunction is linked to dysregulation of BDNF/TrkB, a pathway promoting neuroplasticity, neuronal survival, and stress resilience. Hence, RBFOX1 dysfunction may increase psychiatric disorder vulnerability via HPA axis dysregulation, leading to disrupted development and allostatic overload. To test this hypothesis, we generated a zebrafish , loss of function (LoF) line and examined behavioural and molecular effects during development. In larvae and adults, , LoF resulted in hyperactivity, impulsivity and hyperarousal, and alterations in proliferation, fertility and survival, traits associated with allostatic overload. In larvae, , LoF disrupted expression of ,, and HPI axis genes. These latter were restored after chronic TrkB agonist/antagonist treatment. In adults, ,/, and HPI axes dysregulation was only seen following acute stress. Our findings revealed a strict interplay between RBFOX1 and BDNF/TrkB in stress resilience and suggest that , LoF predisposes to psychiatric diseases through HPA axis hyperactivation during development, impairing adaptation and heightening vulnerability to allostatic overload."

To overcome this challenge, we engineered a replicating retrovirus (RRV) to deliver a superagonist interleukin-15 receptor-linked fusion protein (RLI) directly to tumor cells, engineering them into local immunotherapy biofactories. This strategy leverages the tumor-selective replication of RRV to achieve localized and sustained RLI expression within the tumor microenvironment. In two orthotopic poorly immunogenic GBM mouse models, intratumoral administration of RRV RLI significantly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival compared to controls, with some mice achieving long-term remission and demonstrating immunological memory upon rechallenge. Transcriptomic and flow cytometric analyses revealed that RRV RLI treatment enhanced infiltration and activation of CD8⁺ T cells and NK cells, and upregulated antigen presentation pathways within the tumor microenvironment. Depletion studies indicated that the therapeutic efficacy of RRV RLI is dependent on both CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells. Notably, combining RRV RLI with the GBM standard of care chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide synergistically improved survival outcomes. Subsequent single-cell RNA and T-cell receptor sequencing identified enhanced effector cell activation, antigen presentation, and clonal T-cell expansion in the combination therapy group. Our findings suggest that RRV-mediated delivery of RLI effectively transforms GBM tumors into immunostimulatory hubs, eliciting potent anti-tumor immune responses. This novel viral immunotherapy holds significant promise for clinical translation in the treatment of GBM and other difficult-to-treat solid tumors."

Nonetheless, the specific molecular target and mechanism of action of SSRIs remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we reveal that citalopram exerts an immune-dependent anti-tumor effects in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Interestingly, the anti-HCC effects of citalopram are not reliant on its conventional target, the serotonin transporter. Through various drug repurposing approaches, including global reverse gene expression profiling, drug affinity responsive target stability assay, and molecular docking, the complement component 5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) is identified as a new target of citalopram. C5aR1 is predominantly expressed by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and citalopram treatment enhances local macrophage phagocytosis and elicits CD8, T anti-tumor immunity. At a systemic level, citalopram treatment results in decreased serum 5-HT levels, which correlates with increased activation of CD8, T cells. Additionally, citalopram promotes αCD3/αCD28-stimulated CD8, T cell activation, expansion, and cytotoxicity. Depletion of CD8, T cells partially hinders the anti-HCC effects of citalopram. Collectively, our study reveals multiple immunomodulatory roles of citalopram in inducing anti-tumor immunity, and provides a basis for considering the repurposing of SSRIs as promising anticancer agents for HCC treatment."

However, their application in prostate cancer (PCa) has been hampered by poor success rates and overgrowth of cell types which are not representative of the patient samples. By exploiting a cohort of 164 PCa patient samples and tuning several culture parameters, we show that an extracellular matrix-free (ECM)-free culture system increases the take-rate of PDOs with luminal-like and PCa features. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals that ECM-free PDOs comprise cell populations associated with known PCa signatures and exhibit transcriptomic resemblance with their respective parental tumors. In addition, we define organoid-associated cell type signatures and identify markers discriminating tumors versus benign cells ex vivo and in situ.  Furthermore, we generate the first prostate PDO single-cell atlas integrating previously-published scRNA-seq datasets and our newly-generated data. We show that Matrigel-based organoid cultures derived from primary PCa are essentially composed of benign-like epithelial cells, irrespective of the dataset or the malignant nature of the tissue of origin. In contrast, ECM-free conditions maintain heterogenous patient-specific luminal tumor cell populations and enrich in intermediate cell types. Ultimately, our work will significantly enhance the potential of PDOs in basic and translational PCa research."

However, dose limiting toxicity has hampered NAMPTi in clinical trials. To maximise the therapeutic window, we set out to identify predictive genomic biomarkers. Bioinformatic analysis and screening of a panel of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell lines revealed that cells with RAS/PI3K pathway mutations were sensitive to the NAMPTi FK866. Activity of olaparib and FK866 was associated with a reduction in nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and the PARP substrate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), with coincident increases in ROS production, DNA damage and apoptosis induction. Caspase 3/7 activity was upregulated to a greater extent in RAS/PI3K mutant cell lines.

In recent years, the use of CART therapy which targets CD19 antigen present on the surface of B-cells, has gained significant attention as a treatment option against aggressive and refractory forms of B-ALL. However, the loss of CD19 antigen on B-cell surface due to aberrant splicing under therapy pressure has been suggested as one of the main factors for the emerging CART therapy resistance. Herein, using RT-PCR based splice assays we examined CD19 splicing patterns in 43 primary pediatric B-ALL patient samples spread across various subtypes. We observed that CD19 isoform lacking exon 5-6 exists in ~ 55% of pediatric patients at the initial diagnosis stage itself. Using in-silico analysis, we identified RNA binding proteins, RC3H1 and MBNL1, as potential regulators of exon 5-6 skipping. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis in patient samples revealed that RC3H1 and MBNL1 are significantly upregulated in samples exhibiting exon 5-6 skipping. Taken together, we for the first time report the existence of aberrantly spliced CD19 isoform lacking exon 5-6 in primary pediatric patients, and this occurrence could potentially result from RC3H1 and MBNL1 dysregulation."

One such drug is decitabine, a frontline therapeutic approved for the treatment of high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Decitabine is thought to kill cancer cells selectively via inhibition of DNA methyltransferase enzymes, but the genes and mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, we apply an integrated multiomics and CRISPR functional genomics approach to identify genes and processes associated with response to decitabine in AML cells. Our integrated multiomics approach reveals RNA dynamics are key regulators of DNA hypomethylation induced cell death. Specifically, regulation of RNA decapping, splicing and RNA methylation emerge as critical regulators of cellular response to decitabine."

Here, using oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) as main research model, we discovered that PA28γ interacted with complement 1q binding protein (C1QBP), which is dependent on the N-terminus of C1QBP rather than the known functional domain (amino acids 168-213). Notably, we found that PA28γ can enhance C1QBP protein stability in OSCC. Functionally, PA28γ contributes to the malignant progression of OSCC by affecting mitochondrial morphology and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) through C1QBP in vitro and vivo. Mechanically, PA28γ upregulate the expression of optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), mitofusin 2 (MFN1), mitofusin 2 (MFN2) and the mitochondrial respiratory complex by C1QBP. Moreover, in a clinical cohort of OSCC patients, PA28γ was positively correlated with C1QBP expression and negatively correlated with prognosis. Therefore, C1QBP is also a potential target for the treatment and prognosis of cancer."

Ewing sarcoma is driven primarily by EWSR1::FLI1, a fusion oncoprotein that has been notoriously difficult to target with traditional pharmacologic agents. There are numerous examples of preclinical promising combinations of small molecules that are never tested in pediatric clinical trials because agents fail to reach the market due to limited efficacy for common adult cancers. Moreover, the effectiveness of single-agent therapies for cancer treatment is often limited. To address these limitations, we selected 28 compounds that were largely FDA approved or in late stages of clinical development and known to regulate important pathways in Ewing sarcoma. We performed a drug screen in Ewing sarcoma cell lines with 180 combinations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, cell cycle inhibitors, and conventional chemotherapy. The results of the screen revealed that a PI3K inhibitor, copanlisib, combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, ribociclib, exhibited strong synergistic anti-Ewing sarcoma activity. Using proteomic methods such as a reverse-phase protein array and western immunoblotting, we demonstrated that this combination induced a downregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway as well as proteins involved in cell cycle regulation. We further confirmed these in vitro data using bulk RNA-sequencing. To evaluate the phenotypic effect of the PI3K/CDK4/6 inhibition in Ewing sarcoma lines, we performed apoptosis and cell cycle analyses using flow cytometry and demonstrated that ribociclib primarily induced a G0/G1 arrest with minimal effect on Ewing cell viability but significantly enhanced the apoptotic effect of copanlisib treatment. In a xenograft model of Ewing sarcoma, we demonstrated that the combination therapy significantly prolonged survival compared to treatment with either vehicle or single-agent therapy alone. Our findings identify a new candidate therapy combination for Ewing sarcoma using FDA-approved drugs and provide a resource of additional potential synergistic combinations for future validation."
Cancer Biology,Co-delivery of Paclitaxel and Cannabidiol in Lipid Nanoparticles Enhances Cytotoxicity Against Melanoma Cells,"Fabiola Vieira,Gabriela,Ludmilla David,Talita Cesarim,Marcia Cristina,Eneida,Gustavo Henrique Rodrigues,Fabiola Vieira,Gabriela,Ludmilla David,Talita Cesarim,Marcia Cristina,Eneida,Gustavo Henrique Rodrigues,Fabiola Vieira,Gabriela,Ludmilla David,Talita Cesarim,Marcia Cristina,Eneida","Although chemotherapy regimens are well-established in clinical practice, chemoresistance and adverse side effects pose significant obstacles in cancer treatment. Paclitaxel (PTX), a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, faces formulation challenges due to its poor solubility and permeability. Research suggests that the phytochemical Cannabidiol (CBD) holds potential not only in targeting cancer cells but also in alleviating pain and nausea, thereby improving the quality of life for cancer patients. However, CBD's clinical application is also limited by its poor solubility, low bioavailability, and susceptibility to oxidation. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) represent a promising drug delivery system for hydrophobic compounds like PTX and CBD and allows their co-encapsulation. Nonetheless, achieving a stable formulation requires identifying suitable preparation methods and excipients. The aim of this study was to develop and optimize an NLC formulation for the co-encapsulation of PTX and CBD. Using factorial design, an optimized formulation was obtained with homogeneous particle sizes (200 nm), negative zeta potentials (-17 mV), particle concentration of 10^13 particles/mL, spherical morphology (TEM images), and a lipid core with low crystallinity (as confirmed by XRD). To evaluate the therapeutic potential of the drug combination, cell viability assays were conducted on murine melanoma cells (B16-F10) at different exposure times (24 and 48 hours). The NLC-CBD-PTX formulation significantly reduced cell viability in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, demonstrating at least 75% greater activity at 24 hours compared to each drug individually whether free (PTX, CBD) or encapsulated (NLC-PTX, NLC-CBD). This indicates a synergistic effect of the encapsulated drugs on cytotoxicity. In conclusion, an innovative pharmaceutical formulation co-encapsulating PTX and CBD was validated, showing potential to enhance antitumor efficacy, overcome chemoresistance, reduce side effects, and broaden therapeutic applications. The resulting NLCs exhibited favorable physicochemical properties, supporting their suitability for various routes of administration."
Genetics,SPLENDID incorporates continuous genetic ancestry in biobank-scale data to improve polygenic risk prediction across diverse populations,"Tony,Haoyu,Rahul,Xihong,Tony,Haoyu,Rahul,Xihong,Tony,Haoyu,Rahul","Polygenic risk scores are widely used in disease risk stratification, but their accuracy varies across diverse populations. Recent methods large-scale leverage multi-ancestry data to improve accuracy in under-represented populations but require labelling individuals by ancestry for prediction. This poses challenges for practical use, as clinical practices are typically not based on ancestry. We propose SPLENDID, a novel penalized regression framework for diverse biobank-scale data. Our method utilizes ancestry principal component interactions to model genetic ancestry as a continuum within a single prediction model for all ancestries, eliminating the need for discrete labels. In extensive simulations and analyses of 9 traits from the All of Us Research Program (N=224,364) and UK Biobank (N=340,140), SPLENDID significantly outperformed existing methods in prediction accuracy and model sparsity. By directly incorporating continuous genetic ancestry in model training, SPLENDID stands as a valuable tool for robust risk prediction across diverse populations and fairer clinical implementation."

Recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) have linked variation in a large number of genes with increased risk of ARHL for the first time. Amongst the strongest of these associations is variation in KLHDC7B, a gene of unknown function and one not previously linked to hearing. 
Methods: To confirm whether KLHDC7B plays a role in hearing we investigated auditory function in two independent knockout mutant mouse models of Klhdc7b:  Klhdc7bIMPC-/- and Klhdc7bD/D; on the C57BL/6N background and the B6.CAST-Cdh23753A>G background respectively. The B6.CAST-Cdh23753A>G background was backcrossed to correct a known age-related hearing loss (ahl) mutation in cadherin 23 present in both the C57BL/6N and C57BL/6J strains. 
Results: We showed that Klhdc7b is expressed exclusively in inner and outer sensory hair cells within the cochlea of mice at the RNA and protein level. Homozygous mutants for both knockout mouse models display a similar early-onset, progressive and severe hearing loss. Histological characterization of the two mouse models suggests that hair cells develop normally and are present in neonates. However, after the onset of hearing there is a progressive loss of outer hair cells in a gradient from base to apex of the cochlea consistent with the hearing deficit in the mice and the pattern of hearing loss in ARHL. Inner hair cells remain intact up to the latest age examined (~8 weeks). 
Conclusions: Our data suggests KLHDC7B is required for maintenance of auditory function rather than in its development, supporting the novel association with ARHL in humans detected in recent GWAS. To our knowledge, this is the first validation in mouse of an ARHL association in humans detected in a GWAS.  Our work also provides two distinct mouse models to further investigate the role of KLHDC7B in auditory function and for use in the development of therapeutic tools to prevent or treat ARHL."
Genetics,Balanced polymorphisms in gamete-binding genes are not associated with human infertility,"M. W.,B.,K.,M. W.,B.,K.,M. W.,B.","Genes expressed in gametes that mediate sperm interaction with the mammalian egg are of considerable interest to evolutionary biologists because the evolution of such genes can account for variation in reproductive compatibility between mates and reproductive isolation between species. The human orthologs of such genes are also potential targets for both contraception and treatment of infertility. One gene system of particular interest is the sperm-binding genes of the inner egg coat or zona pellucida (,) and their cognate protein in the mouse sperm acrosome (,). Previous population genetic analyses in humans pointed toward three balanced polymorphisms (one in each gene ,, and ,) as potential targets of some form of balancing selection in the evolution of human fertility. We tested that association using genetic analysis of couples seeking fertility assistance, but we could not reject the null hypothesis of no association between balanced polymorphisms and infertility. Our study was based on a small sample of couples, but the data were sound: the allele frequencies at those three balanced polymorphisms were not different from random expectation in that clinical sample. If an effect of those allele frequencies on infertility exists it is probably small. Our study was based in part on an old error in gene annotation that was only recently discovered (after the start of participant recruitment for this genetic analysis), and this error may account for our results, which argue against a role for balancing selection on those three genes in humans."
Genetics,Machine vision based frailty assessment for genetically diverse mice,"Gautam S,Gary A,Vivek,Gautam S,Gary A,Vivek,Gautam S,Gary A","Frailty indexes (FIs) capture health status in humans and model organisms. To accelerate our understanding of biological aging and carry out scalable interventional studies, high-throughput approaches are necessary. We previously introduced a machine vision-based visual frailty index (vFI) that uses mouse behavior in the open field to assess frailty using C57BL/6J (B6J) data. Aging trajectories are highly genetic and are frequently modeled in genetically diverse animals. In order to extend the vFI to genetically diverse mouse populations, we collect frailty and behavior data on a large cohort of aged Diversity Outbred (DO) mice. Combined with previous data, this represents one of the largest video-based aging behavior datasets to date. Using these data, we build accurate predictive models of frailty, chronological age, and even the proportion of life lived. The extension of automated and objective frailty assessment tools to genetically diverse mice will enable better modeling of aging mechanisms and enable high-throughput interventional aging studies."

Here, we demonstrate that CXCL12 forms a gradient specifically around cancer cell intravasation doorways, also known as Tumor Microenvironment of Metastasis (TMEM) doorways, thus facilitating the chemotactic translocation of prometastatic tumor cells expressing CXCR4 toward the perivascular TMEM doorways for subsequent entry into peripheral circulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the CXCL12-rich micro-environment around TMEM doorways may create immunosuppressive niches, whereby CD8+ T cells, despite being attracted to these regions, often exhibit reduced effector functions, limiting their efficacy. While the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway can minimally influence the overall composition of immune cell populations, it biases the distribution of CD8+ T cells away from TMEM doorways, justifying its prior-established role as immunosuppressive factor for CD8+ T cells. Our research suggests that the complex interactions between CXCL12 and the various tumor and immune cell types contributes not only to the completion of the initial steps of the metastatic cascade, but also offers an immunological 'sanctuary' to prometastatic tumor cells homed around TMEM doorways. Overall, our study enhances our current understanding on the mechanisms, via which CXCL12 orchestrates tumor cell behavior and immune dynamics, potentially guiding future therapeutic strategies to combat breast cancer metastasis and improve anti-tumor immunity."

Numerous methods have been developed to infer GRNs from gene expression data, including mechanism-based approaches, information-based approaches, and more recent deep learning techniques, the last of which often overlooks the underlying gene expression mechanisms. In this work, we introduce TRENDY, a novel GRN inference method that integrates transformer models to enhance the mechanism-based WENDY approach. Through testing on both simulated and experimental datasets, TRENDY demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we apply this transformer-based approach to three additional inference methods, showcasing its broad potential to enhance GRN inference."
Genetics,Accurate and flexible estimation of effective population size history,"Zhendong,Yao-ban,David,Zhendong,Yao-ban,David,Zhendong,Yao-ban","Current methods for inferring historical population sizes from DNA sequences often impose a heavy computational burden, or relieve that burden by imposing a fixed parametric form. In addition, they can be marred by sequencing errors or uncertainty about recombination rates, and the quality of inference is often poor in the recent past. We propose ""InferNo"" for flexible, nonparametric inference of effective population sizes. It requires modest computing resources and little prior knowledge of the recombination and mutation maps, and is robust to sequencing error and gene conversion. We illustrate the statistical and computational advantages of InferNo over previous approaches using a range of simulation scenarios. In particular, we demonstrate the ability of InferNo to exploit biobank-scale datasets for accurate inference of rapid population size changes in the recent past. We also apply Inferno to worldwide human data, finding remarkable similarities in inferences from different populations in the same region. Unlike previous studies, we show two historic bottlenecks for most of the non-African populations."

Access to the EMR is both retrospective and prospective, allowing researchers to conduct prospective studies over time. Genetic profiling is done with population-optimized SNP arrays for the Han Chinese populations that enable genetic analyses such as genome-wide association, phenome-wide association, and polygenic risk score studies to evaluate common disease risk and pharmacogenetic response. Furthermore, the TPMI participants agree to be contacted for future research opportunities related to their genetic risks and receive personalized genetic risk profiles with health management recommendations. TPMI has established the TPMI Data Access Platform (TDAP), a central database and analysis platform that both safeguards the security of the data and facilitates academic research. The TPMI is the largest non-European cohort that merges genetic profiles with EMR in the world. With a cohort that can be followed over time, it can be utilized to validate genetic risk prediction models, conduct clinical trials to show the efficacy of risk-based health management, and optimize health policies based on genetic risks. In this report, we describe the TPMI study design, the population and genetic characteristics of the TPMI cohort, and the power it provides to conduct crucial studies in developing precision medicine on a population and personal level.

Genetics,Benchmarking Bayesian colocalization methods in validating Mendelian randomization-based target discoveries from circulating proteins for cardiometabolic diseases,"Wenmin,Satoshi,Rob,Josée,Tianyuan,Wenmin,Satoshi,Rob,Josée,Tianyuan,Wenmin,Satoshi,Rob,Josée","Background
Mendelian randomization (MR) is an important tool for identifying potential biomarkers and drug targets. Colocalization analysis is crucial for validating MR findings and guarding against potential confounding due to linkage disequilibrium. We aim to systematically benchmark the performance of four Bayesian colocalization methods in validating MR-based target discoveries from circulating proteins for cardiometabolic diseases.
Results
We conducted MR analyses to assess the associations between circulating levels of 1,535 proteins and five cardiometabolic traits, followed by colocalization analyses using coloc, coloc+SuSiE, PWCoCo and SharePro. All methods demonstrated well-controlled false discoveries in the colocalization analysis of 611 pairs of circulating proteins and cardiometabolic traits with a nominal p-value > 0.9 in MR. SharePro demonstrated the highest frequency in supporting 160 (79.6%) of the 201 Bonferroni-significant protein-trait associations identified by MR, compared to coloc (supporting 40.3% of these associations), coloc+SuSiE (46.8%), and PWCoCo (45.8%), and was robust to varying prior colocalization probabilities. Moreover, protein-trait associations identified by MR and supported by SharePro were more likely to agree with significant gene-level associations based on rare variants detected in exome-wide association studies and implicate known drug targets for cardiometabolic diseases. Eight protein-trait associations were exclusively supported by SharePro and did not demonstrate a high risk of horizontal pleiotropy, suggesting potential cardiometabolic biomarkers or drug targets, such as HSF1 and HAVCR2.
Conclusions
SharePro most often supports high-confidence associations identified through MR for cardiometabolic diseases. Combining multiple lines of evidence using different methods may substantially increase the yield of biomarker and drug target discovery programs."

However, how chromatin remodeling directs the transcriptome during meiosis in male germ cells is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the ISWI family ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor SMARCA5 (SNF2H) plays a critical role in regulating meiotic prophase progression during spermatogenesis. Males with germ cell-specific depletion of SMARCA5 are infertile and unable to form sperm. Loss of Smarca5 results in failure of meiotic progression with abnormal spermatocytes beginning at the pachytene stage and an aberrant global increase in chromatin accessibility, especially at genes important for meiotic prophase."

Increased tumor stiffness, resulting from interactions between cancer cells and their surrounding microenvironment, alters the tumor's mechanical properties and significantly impacts cancer growth and metastasis, the primary cause of cancer-related deaths. Despite the importance of tumor stiffness, systematic studies exploring its effect on proteomic profiles are limited. In this study, focused on colorectal cancer, we show that matrix stiffness significantly alters the expression of secreted proteins, while intracellular protein levels remain largely unaffected. Functional assays reveal that the changes in the secretome, driven by matrix stiffness, enhance cell migration, angiogenesis, and matrix remodeling, which collectively contribute to a more aggressive cancer phenotype. Our findings emphasize the critical role of matrix stiffness in driving colorectal cancer progression through changes in the secretome, offering valuable insights for the development of biomechanical cancer therapies."

The extent to trees sequester and allocate carbon to above- or belowground structures in turn is mediated by neighbouring species. Although many studies have demonstrated positive effects of diverse neighbourhoods on a tree's productivity, little is known about biomass allocation responses to mono- vs. heterospecific neighbourhoods. In the present study we quantified above- and belowground biomass production and root-to-shoot ratios (RSR) of trees grown in mono- and heterospecific neighbourhoods. To this end we analysed growth of mono- and heterospecific tree species pairs (TSPs) established in a greenhouse and a field experiment. In the greenhouse experiment response variables were measured after one year of growth after sapling harvest. In the field experiment, conducted in the context of a forest biodiversity experiment in subtropical China, we analysed biomass density and RSR over three years using terrestrial laser scanner and minirhizotrons. RSR of trees in heterospecific TSPs were significantly higher than in monospecific TSPs. In the greenhouse experiment, this was related to a stronger below- than aboveground overyielding in heterospecific TSPs. In the field experiment, trees in heterospecific TSPs showed a stronger increase in aboveground investments over time than in monospecific TSPs, indicating that positive diversity effects became stronger for aboveground structures with progressing tree development. Our findings are consistent with the optimal biomass partitioning theory and highlight the importance of tree-tree interactions on biomass allocation. Higher RSR in mixtures further suggest a higher resistance or resilience of tree saplings against environmental stressors related to climate change (drought, heat waves)."
Developmental Biology,Independent control of neurogenesis and dorsoventral patterning by NKX2-2,"Sumin,Elena,Julie,Hynek,Sumin,Elena,Julie,Hynek,Sumin,Elena,Julie","Human neurogenesis is disproportionately protracted, lasting >10 times longer than in mouse, allowing neural progenitors to undergo more rounds of self-renewing cell divisions and generate larger neuronal populations. In the human spinal cord, expansion of the motor neuron lineage is achieved through a newly evolved progenitor domain called vpMN (ventral motor neuron progenitor) that uniquely extends and expands motor neurogenesis. This behavior of vpMNs is controlled by transcription factor NKX2-2, which in vpMNs is co-expressed with classical motor neuron progenitor (pMN) marker OLIG2. In this study, we sought to determine the molecular basis of NKX2-2-mediated extension and expansion of motor neurogenesis. We found that NKX2-2 represses proneural gene , by two distinct, Notch-independent mechanisms that are respectively apparent in rodent and human spinal progenitors: in rodents (and chick), NKX2-2 represses , and the motor neuron lineage through its tinman domain, leading to loss of , expression. In human vpMNs, however, NKX2-2 represses , but not ,, thereby allowing motor neurogenesis to proceed, albeit in a delayed and protracted manner. Interestingly, we found that ectopic expression of tinman-mutant , in mouse pMNs phenocopies human vpMNs, repressing , but not ,, and leading to delayed and protracted motor neurogenesis.

We use conditional and restrictive expression tools to spatiotemporally manipulate core protein activity, combined with quantitative measurement of core protein distribution, polarity and stability. Our results provide evidence for a robust cell-scale signal, while arguing against mechanisms that depend on depletion of a limited pool of a core protein or polarised transport of core proteins on microtubules. Furthermore, we show that polarity propagation across a tissue is hard, highlighting the strong intrinsic capacity of individual cells to establish and maintain planar polarity."
Genomics,"Copy number variation analysis of 9,482 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates identifies lineage-specific molecular determinants.","Nikhil,Anil Kumar,Ashish,Ranjan,Nikhil,Anil Kumar,Ashish,Ranjan,Nikhil,Anil Kumar,Ashish","Background: Clinical manifestations of tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) show lineage-specific differences contributed by genetic polymorphism such as phylo-single nucleotide variations (PhyloSNPs) and insertion or deletions (INDELs). Intragenomic rearrangement events, such as gene duplications and deletions, may cause gene copy number differences in Mtb, contributing to lineage-specific phenotypic variations, if any, which need better understanding. Results: The relative gene copy number differences in high-quality publicly available whole genome sequencing datasets of 9,482 clinical Mtb isolates were determined by repurposing and modifying an RNA-seq data analysis pipeline. The pipeline included various steps, viz., alignment of reads, sorting by coordinate, GC bias correction, and variant stabilising transformation. The strategy showed maximum separation of lineage-specific clusters in two principal components, capturing ~54% variability. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the top 100 genes and pairwise comparisons between Mtb lineages revealed an overlapping subset of genes (n=42) having significantly perturbed copy numbers (Benjamin Hochberg adjusted P-value < 0.05 and log2(drug-resistant/sensitive) > ± 1). These 42 genes formed multiple tandem gene clusters and are known to be involved in virulence, pathogenicity and defence response to invading phages. A separate comparison showed a significantly high copy number of phage genes and a recently reported druggable target Rv1525 in pre- and extensively drug-resistant (Pre-XDR, XDR) compared to drug-sensitive clinical Mtb isolates. Conclusion: The identified gene sets in Mtb clinical isolates may be useful targets for lineage-specific therapeutics and diagnostics development."

These forces shape patterns of gene expression variation within and between species, including the regulatory mechanisms governing expression in cis and trans. In this study, we interrogate intraspecific gene expression variation among seven wild C. elegans strains, with varying degrees of genomic divergence from the reference strain N2, leveraging this system's unique advantages  to comprehensively evaluate gene expression evolution. By capturing allele-specific and between-strain changes in expression, we characterize the regulatory architecture and inheritance mode of gene expression variation within C. elegans and assess their relationship to nucleotide diversity, genome evolutionary history, gene essentiality, and other biological factors. We conclude that stabilizing selection is a dominant influence in maintaining expression phenotypes within the species, and the discovery that genes with higher overall expression tend to exhibit fewer expression differences supports this conclusion, as do widespread instances of cis differences compensated in trans. Moreover, analyses of human expression data replicate our finding that higher expression genes have less variable expression. We also observe evidence for directional selection driving expression divergence, and that expression divergence accelerates with increasing genomic divergence. To provide community access to the data from this first analysis of allele-specific expression in C. elegans, we introduce an interactive web application, where users can submit gene-specific queries to view expression, regulatory pattern, inheritance mode, and other information: https://wildworm.biosci.gatech.edu/ase/."
Ecology,Melanization interacts with soil mineral and microbial properties to determine fungal carbon and nitrogen persistence in soils,"Katilyn Victoria,Elizabeth,Lang Carl,François,Bowen,Per,Peter Gault,Richard,Katilyn Victoria,Elizabeth,Lang Carl,François,Bowen,Per,Peter Gault,Richard,Katilyn Victoria,Elizabeth,Lang Carl,François,Bowen,Per,Peter Gault","Despite the importance of mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) in long-term soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) persistence, and the significant contribution of fungal necromass to this pool, the factors controlling the formation of fungal-derived MAOM remain unclear. This study investigated how fungal necromass chemistry, specifically melanin, interacts with soil mineral properties and microbial communities to influence MAOM formation and persistence. We cultured the fungus Hyaloscypha bicolor to produce 13C- and 15N-labeled necromass with varying melanin content (high or low) and incubated it in both live and sterile soils collected from six Indiana forests that differed in their clay and iron oxide (FeOx) content. After 38 days, we found that seven times more fungal-derived N was incorporated into MAOM than fungal-derived C, with fungal N comprising 20% of the MAOM-N pool. Low melanin necromass formed more MAOM-C than high melanin necromass, although site-level differences in overall MAOM formation were substantial. Soil clay and FeOx content were strong predictors of MAOM formation, explaining ~60% and ~68% of the variation in MAOM-C and MAOM-N, respectively. However, microbial communities significantly influenced MAOM formation, with MAOM-C formation enhanced and MAOM-N formation reduced in sterile soils. Furthermore, the relative abundance of fungal saprotrophs was negatively correlated, and bacterial richness was positively correlated with MAOM formation, and these relationships were influenced by necromass melanin content. This study reveals that microbial communities and soil properties interactively mediate the incorporation of fungal necromass C and N into MAOM, with microbes differentially influencing C and N incorporation, and these processes being further modulated by necromass melanization."
Epidemiology,"Ownership, Coverage, Utilisation and Maintenance of Long-lasting insecticidal nets in Three Health Districts in Cameroon: A Cross-Sectional Study","Frederick Nchang,Paulette Ngum,Blessing Menyi,Solange Fri,Patrick Kofon,Yayah Emerencia,Celestina Neh,Andrew N,Albert Same,Frederick Nchang,Paulette Ngum,Blessing Menyi,Solange Fri,Patrick Kofon,Yayah Emerencia,Celestina Neh,Andrew N,Albert Same,Frederick Nchang,Paulette Ngum,Blessing Menyi,Solange Fri,Patrick Kofon,Yayah Emerencia,Celestina Neh,Andrew N","The Bamenda, Santa and Tiko Health Districts are in the highest malaria transmission strata of Cameroon. The purpose of this study was to explore the indicators of ownership and utilisation as well as maintenance of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) in three health districts in Cameroon. A cross-sectional household survey involving 1,251 households was conducted in the Bamenda, Santa and Tiko Health Districts in Cameroon. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on LLINs ownership, utilisation, and maintenance as well as demographic characteristics. The average number of LLINs per household was higher in the Bamenda Health District (BHD) compared to the Tiko Health District (THD) (2.5±1.4 vs 2.4±1.6) as well as the household ownership of at least one LLIN (93.3% vs. 88.9%). The proportion of the , population with universal utilisation was higher in BHD compared to THD (13.1% vs 0.2%). In multinomial regression analysis, households in the Santa Health District (SHD) (OR = 0.4, 95% = C.I; 0.2 – 0.8, , = 6.10×10,), were less likely to own at least one LLIN, while those in the BHD (OR = 1.3, 95% = C.I; 0.8 – 2.1, , = 0.33) were more likely to maintain LLINs compared to those in THD. Ownership of LLINs was low in SHD and THD in comparison to the goal of one LLIN for every two household members. Overall, LLINs coverage and accessibility was still low after the free Mass Distribution Campaigns, making it difficult for all household members to effectively use LLINs."
Cancer Biology,Path2Space: An AI Approach for Cancer Biomarker Discovery Via Histopathology Inferred Spatial Transcriptomics,"Eldad David,Emma M,Roshan,Thomas,Tom,Maclean,Danh-Tai,Kenneth,Eytan,Eldad David,Emma M,Roshan,Thomas,Tom,Maclean,Danh-Tai,Kenneth,Eytan,Eldad David,Emma M,Roshan,Thomas,Tom,Maclean,Danh-Tai,Kenneth","The rise of spatial transcriptomics (ST) is transforming our understanding of tumor heterogeneity by enabling high-resolution, location-specific mapping of gene expression across the tumor microenvironment. However, the translational potential of spatial transcriptomics is still limited by its high cost, hindering the assembly of large patient cohorts needed for robust biomarker discovery. Here we present Path2Space, a deep learning model trained on spatial transcriptomics data to predict spatial gene expression directly from histopathology slides. Studying breast cancer, the model was first trained on one ST breast cancer patients cohort and further independently tested and validated on two other ST cohorts. Path2Space identifies 4,500 genes whose spatial expression is robustly predicted in all three cohorts, markedly more accurate than existing ST predictors. Second, we show that based on the inferred ST, Path2Space accurately infers cell-type abundances in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Thirdly, Applying Path2Space to the TCGA breast cancer cohort we identify three TME spatially grounded subsets of patients that have markedly different survival rates. Fourth, analyzing two large breast cancer patients cohorts treated with trastuzumab, we show that the heterogeneity of the inferred HER2 levels across the tumor microenvironment is predictive of response, concordant with the bystander hypothesis. Finally, we developed a spatially interpretable model for predicting trastuzumab response directly from the H&E-slides. This model's performance surpasses that of existing response prediction models that use measured bulk multi-omics data. Path2Space is the first approach capable of robustly delineating the tumor microenvironment on an unprecedented scale directly from the tumor slides. It heralds the upcoming development of robust spatially grounded biomarkers of patients survival and treatment that promises to transform precision oncology in both the developed and developing worlds."

Epigenome-targeted DNA repair can help organisms protect important genomic regions from mutation. However, the adaptive value, mechanistic diversity, and evolution of epigenome-targeted DNA repair systems across the tree of life remain unresolved. Here, we investigated the evolution of histone reader domains fused to the DNA repair protein MSH6 (MutS Homolog 6) across over 4,000 eukaryotes. We uncovered a paradigmatic example of convergent evolution: MSH6 has independently acquired distinct histone reader domains, each targeting histone modifications in active genes. Conservation in MSH6 histone reader domains shows signatures of natural selection, particularly for amino acids that bind specific histone modifications. Species that have gained or retained MSH6 histone readers tend to have larger genome sizes, especially marked by a significantly greater contribution of introns to genic regions. These patterns support theoretical predictions about the conditions under which coding sequence hypomutation is likely beneficial. The evolution of epigenome-targeted DNA repair has implications for genome evolution, health, and the mutational origins of genomic diversity across the tree of life."
Evolutionary Biology,Genealogies under purifying selection,"Ksenia A,Florin,Julie,Ksenia A,Florin,Julie,Ksenia A,Florin","Selection against deleterious mutations, called purifying selection, plays a central role in evolution and acts in all populations. It is known that the genetic patterns observed in genomic regions undergoing purifying selection differ from those resulting from neutral evolution. However, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms shaping those patterns is still lacking. In the present work, we use simulations combined with a genealogical approach to identify the effect of purifying selection on the ancestry and thus on the genetic diversity. Our analysis relies on the postulate that the genealogy belongs to the universality class of Beta-coalescents. Under this assumption, we derive statistics measuring the distortion of the genealogy. This approach allows us to consider a wide range of regimes (i.e. arbitrary selection and mutation strengths) and uncover a rich phase diagram. We find that, for strong selection, the limiting genealogy is given by Kingman's coalescent on a polynomial timescale. As selection gets weaker, Muller's ratchet starts operating, setting off the emergence of multiple mergers in the genealogical structures. Our results show that while multiple-merger coalescents are often interpreted as the signature of selective sweeps in rapidly adapting populations, these structures can also appear in the context of Muller's ratchet."

We identified 82,174 ACRs and reported that 39.55% of them exhibited significant variation across the population. Next, we used the accessibility of ACRs as a quantitative feature and performed a chromatin associability GWAS (caGWAS), resulting in 27,004 caQTLs. Among them, 2,463 were predicted to disrupt the cis-regulatory elements that TF binds in these ACRs, suggesting that TF binding affects chromatin accessibility. Specifically, we identified two caACRs that regulate the expression of fad7, which encodes a fatty acid desaturase and affects the linolenic acid content.Our findings highlight the dynamic nature of maize ACRs and demonstrate that chromatin accessibility information could be used for GWASs, offering key insights into the genetic and regulatory mechanisms of chromatin accessibility and its impact on complex traits in plants."
Genomics,Xist RNA binds select autosomal genes and depends on Repeat B to regulate their expression,"Shengze,Yesu,Barry,Jeannie T,Shengze,Yesu,Barry,Jeannie T,Shengze,Yesu,Barry","Xist, a pivotal player in X chromosome inactivation (XCI), has long been perceived as a cis-acting long noncoding RNA that binds exclusively to the inactive X chromosome (Xi). However, Xists ability to diffuse under select circumstances has also been documented, leading us to suspect that Xist RNA may have targets and functions beyond the Xi. Here, using female mouse embryonic stem cells (ES) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) as models, we demonstrate that Xist RNA indeed can localize beyond the Xi. However, its binding is limited to approximately 100 genes in cells undergoing XCI (ES cells) and in post-XCI cells (MEFs). The target genes are diverse in function but are unified by their active chromatin status. Xist binds discretely to promoters of target genes in neighborhoods relatively depleted for Polycomb marks, contrasting with the broad, Polycomb-enriched domains reported for human XIST RNA. We find that Xist binding is associated with down-modulation of autosomal gene expression. However, unlike on the Xi, Xist binding does not lead to full silencing and also does not spread beyond the target gene. Over-expressing Xist in transgenic ES cells similarly leads to autosomal gene suppression, while deleting Xists Repeat B motif reduces autosomal binding and perturbs autosomal down-regulation. Furthermore, treating female ES cells with the Xist inhibitor, X1, leads to loss of autosomal suppression. Altogether, our findings reveal that Xist targets ~100 genes beyond the Xi, identify Repeat B as a crucial domain for its in-trans function in mice, and indicate that autosomal targeting can be disrupted by a small molecule inhibitor."

Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship between Ae. comosa and Ae. umbellulata. This newly constructed reference genome of Ae. comosa will serve as an important genomic resource for comparative genomic studies and the cloning of agriculturally important genes."
Genetics,Becker muscular dystrophy mice showed site-specific decay of type IIa fibers with capillary change in skeletal muscle,"Daigo,Mitsuto,Naoko,Takahiro,Akinori,Daigo,Mitsuto,Naoko,Takahiro,Akinori,Daigo,Mitsuto,Naoko,Takahiro","Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), an X—linked muscular dystrophy, is mostly caused by an in—frame deletion of DMD. BMD severity varies from asymptomatic to severe, associated with the genotype of DMD. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We established BMD mice carrying three representative exon deletions: ex45—48 del., ex45—47 del., and ex45—49 del. (d45—48, d45—47 and d45—49), with high frequencies and different severities in the human BMD hotspot. All three BMD mice showed muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, and fibrosis, but these changes appeared at different times for each exon deletion, consistent with the severities obtained by the natural history study of BMD. BMD mice showed site—specific muscle changes, unlike mdx mice, which showed diffuse muscle changes, and we demonstrated selective type IIa fiber reduction in BMD mice. Furthermore, BMD mice showed sarcolemmal neuronal nitric oxide synthetase (nNOS) reduction and morphological capillary changes around type IIa fibers. These results suggest that capillary changes caused by nNOS reduction may be associated with the mechanism of skeletal muscle degeneration and type IIa fiber reduction in BMD mice. BMD mice may be useful in elucidating the pathomechanisms and developing therapeutic strategies for human BMD."

We found that while transcriptional scores created from differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in individual PD and COVID-19 datasets had moderate predictive power for the case control status of other datasets (mean AUC=0.77 and 0.75, respectively), genes from individual AD datasets had poor predictive power (mean AUC=0.68). We developed a non-parametric meta-analysis method, SumRank, based on reproducibility of relative differential expression ranks across datasets. The meta-analysis genes had improved predictive power (AUCs of 0.88, 0.91, and 0.78, respectively). By multiple other metrics, specificity and sensitivity of these genes were substantially higher than those discovered by dataset merging and inverse variance weighted p-value aggregation methods. The DEGs revealed known and novel biological pathways, and we validate the BCAT1 gene as down-regulated in oligodendrocytes in an AD mouse model. Our analyses show that for heterogeneous diseases, DEGs of individual studies often have low reproducibility, but combining information across multiple datasets promotes the rigorous discovery of reproducible DEGs."

Genomics,PARMIK: PArtial Read Matching with Inexpensive K-mers,"Morteza,Ryan M,Kevin,Morteza,Ryan M,Kevin,Morteza,Ryan M","Environmental metagenomic sampling is instrumental in preparing for future pandemics by enabling early identification of potential pathogens and timely intervention strategies. Novel pathogens are a major concern, especially for zoonotic events. However, discovering novel pathogens often requires genome assembly, which remains a significant bottleneck. A robust metagenomic sampling that is directly searchable with new infection samples would give us a real-time understanding of outbreak origins dynamics. In this study, we propose PArtial Read Matching with Inexpensive K-mers (PARMIK), which is a search tool for efficiently identifying similar sequences from a patient sample (query) to a metagenomic sample (read). For example, at 90% identity between a query and a read, PARMIK surpassed BLAST, providing up to 21% higher recall. By filtering highly frequent k-mers, we reduced PARMIK's index size by over 50%. Moreover, PARMIK identified longer alignments faster than BLAST, peaking at 1.57x, when parallelizing across 32 cores."

Lawrence,Katrina M,Poppy C.,Jessie A.,D. Lawrence","Premise: Pectocarya recurvata (Boraginaceae), a native species of the Sonoran Desert, has served as an important model system for a suite of ecological and evolutionary studies. Despite its relevance as an eco-evolutionary model, no reference genome assemblies in the Cynoglossoideae subfamily have been published.
Methods: Using PacBio HiFi sequencing, we assembled a reference genome for P. recurvata and annotated coding regions with full-length transcripts from an Iso-Seq transcriptome library. We assessed genome completeness with BUSCO and used flow cytometry and K-mer analysis to estimate the genome size of P. recurvata.
Results: The chromosome-scale reference genome assembly for P. recurvata was 216.0 Mbp long with a contig N50 of 12.1 Mbp. Our assembly included 12 primary contigs bounded by telomeres at all ends but one, consistent with the 12 chromosomes documented for the species. The chromosomes covered 158.3 Mbp and contained 30,655 predicted genes. Our measured haploid genome size from the same population was 386.5 Mbp, among the smallest for Boraginaceae. Genomic analyses suggested that this may reflect a recent autotetraploid, such that predicted diploid genome size would be even smaller and similar to the assembly size.
Discussion: The P. recurvata assembly and annotation provide a high-quality genomic resource in a sparsely represented area of the Angiosperm phylogeny. Our new genome will enable future ecophysiology, biogeography, and phylogenetics research."

We conducted the largest disease-focused expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis using colon tissue from 252 IBD patients to determine genetic effects on gene expression and potential contribution to IBD. Combined with two non-IBD colon eQTL studies, we identified 194 potential target genes for 108 GWAS loci. eQTL in IBD tissue were enriched for IBD GWAS loci colocalizations, provided novel evidence for IBD-associated genes such as ABO and TNFRSF14, and identified additional target genes compared to non-IBD tissue eQTL. IBD-associated eQTL unique to diseased tissue had distinct regulatory and functional characteristics with increased effect sizes. Together, these highlight the importance of eQTL studies in diseased tissue for understanding functional consequences of genetic variants, and elucidating molecular mechanisms and regulation of key genes involved in IBD."

This barrier comprises unisex hyper-long hydrocarbons, 29-37 carbons in length, which are synthesized by larval oenocytes and stored in the larval fat body before being deployed on the pupal and young adult cuticles. We show that the fatty acid elongase , is required for the biosynthesis of hyper-long hydrocarbons that are essential for the barrier to water loss during metamorphosis. Across the , genus, many species express unisex profiles of hyper-long hydrocarbons and, as young adults, transition to sex-specific shorter hydrocarbons with known pheromonal functions.

Migratory birds are particularly important for the maintenance and long distance spread of the virus to wild bird and poultry species but eventually to mammal species as well. Antarctica's pristine environment and wildlife is of immense biological value, but the spread of such deadly viruses pose a substantial threat to the region's fragile ecosystems. To investigate the presence of respiratory viruses in the region we sampled feces of different wild migratory birds at various localities in the South Shetland Islands in the Antarctic summer of 2023 and screened them for coronaviruses (CoVs) and influenza A virus (IAV). Viral screening was performed by the conventional pancoronavirus RT-PCR protocol (CoVs), by quantitative one-step real-time RT-PCR (IAVs) followed by metatranscriptomic sequencing of positive samples. During January and February of 2023, we collected and examined a total of 243 fecal samples representing Stercorarius spp (N=5), Larus dominicanus (N=16), Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis (N=3), Pygoscelis adeliae (N=19), Pygoscelis antarcticus (N=38), Pygoscelis papua (N=139), Pygoscelis spp (N=23). All tested samples were negative for influenza A and one sample from the colony of L. dominicanus at Keller Peninsula, King George Island, tested positive for CoVs. Metatranscriptomic sequencing recovered a full deltaCoV genome. Nucleotide and amino acid distance analysis revealed that the deltacoronavirus detected belongs to subgenus Buldecovirus and to the novel wild bird deltaCoV clade previously identified infecting Antarctica penguins. The identified deltaCov is most closely related to a deltacoronavirus previously identified 2014 in P. papua penguin sampled at Isla Kopaitik, Base O'Higgin suggesting a potential cross species transmission. The presence of CoVs in Antarctic migratory seabirds raises concerns about their impact on the wild bird population in Antarctica and their potential role in virus dispersion through intra and intercontinental migratory routes. These findings contribute valuable insights into virus dynamics among seabird populations, laying the groundwork for future investigations in this field and warning of the importance of viral surveillance on the Antarctic fauna."

We used single-cell RNA-seq data from chick embryonic neural tube to characterize the molecular mechanisms that drive this transition. Here we show that Cdkn1c, a key cell cycle regulator which is classically associated with neuronal cell cycle exit, plays an earlier role during neurogenesis by favoring a shift towards neurogenic mode of division. Cdkn1c expression progressively increases in neural progenitors, and its knock down leads to a reduction of neuron production, following a shortening of cell cycle mainly attributed to a reduction in G1 duration. Clonal analysis of pairs of sister cells indicates that reducing Cdkn1c expression in progenitors delays neurogenesis by favoring a symmetric proliferative mode of division. Combined CyclinD1 and Cdkn1c knockdowns restores the cell cycle defects and a wild-type distribution of modes of division, indicating that Cdkn1c acts via the regulation of cell cycle parameters. We propose a sequential role for Cdkn1c in neuron production, with its progressive expression in progenitors first promoting neurogenic division patterns via cell-cycle lengthening, before mediating cell cycle exit in daughter cells."

Owen,Gregory A.,Arnaud,Ling S.,Joseph J.,Alexander,Martik,Martina,Donya N.,Luca,Christopher R.,Robert D.,W. Owen,Gregory A.","The evolution of sexual secondary characteristics necessitates regulatory factors that confer sexual identity to differentiating tissues and cells. In , butterflies, males exhibit two specialized wing scale types — UV-iridescent (UVI) and lanceolate scales — absent in females and likely integral to male courtship behavior. This study investigates the regulatory mechanisms and single-nucleus transcriptomics underlying these two sexually dimorphic cell types during wing development. We show that Doublesex (Dsx) expression is itself dimorphic and required to repress the UVI cell state in females, while unexpectedly, UVI activation in males is independent from Dsx. In the melanic marginal band, Dsx is required in each sex to enforce the presence of lanceolate scales in males, and their absence in females. Single-nucleus RNAseq reveals that UV-iridescent and lanceolate scale cell precursors each show distinctive gene expression profiles at 40% of pupal development, with marker genes that include regulators of transcription, cell signaling, cytoskeletal patterning, and chitin secretion. Both male-specific cell types share a low expression of the , (,) transcription factor, a key repressor of the UVI fate. Bab ChIP-seq profiling suggests that Bab binds the cis-regulatory regions of gene markers associated to UVI fate, including potential effector genes involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal processes and chitin secretion, and loci showing signatures of recent selective sweeps in an UVI-polymorphic population. These findings open new avenues for exploring wing patterning and scale development, shedding light on the mechanisms driving the specification of sex-specific cell states and the differentiation of specialized cell ultrastructures."

Developmental Biology,Experimental short-term heatwaves negatively impact body weight gain and survival during larval development in a wild pollinator,"Laura,Christoph,Laura,Christoph,Laura","Climate change-induced heatwaves threaten global biodiversity, including crucial pollinators like bumblebees. Despite alarming projections, little is known about the effects of short-term heatwaves on insect larval development. Hence, we investigated the impact of simulated heatwaves on the development of fourth instar larvae (L4) of , L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) using an , rearing method. Individual larvae were incubated at 37°C and 38°C for a period of 4 days, with a constant rearing temperature of 34°C as the control. We examined body weight gain, developmental duration, survival to adult stage, and adult body size (i.e. dry mass, ITD, and head width). A simulated heatwave of 37°C did not significantly affect larval development, but 38°C impaired larval body mass gain. While developmental duration and adult body size were unaffected, an acute heat stress of 38°C during the L4 stage reduced the probability of pupae reaching adulthood. These findings highlight the potential for heatwaves to negatively affect bee populations by impairing larval growth and reducing survival to the adult stage, which may have severe implication for colony fitness."

However, most of these studies have been limited by their focus on mammalian systems. Here, we aimed to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms that are active during lung growth and tissue repair in amphibians, specifically Xenopus tropicalis (,). First, we analyzed the stem cell composition and signaling pathways that are active in epithelial and mesenchymal cells during lung growth. Then, we established a protocol for lung injury to assess the types of stem cells underlying tissue repair. In mammals, Sftpc+ (AT2) cells are alveolar stem cells that can differentiate to Krt8+ cells during lung homeostasis and post-injury repair. In this study, we identified Sftpc+ cells and Krt8+ cells, along with the activity of key developmental signaling pathways, Hippo and Wnt, during lung maturation at post-metamorphosis stages. We then established a protocol for lung injury using chemically induced injury with bleomycin, which damages the lung through oxidative stress. The results show an elevation in collagen post-injury, indicating bleomycin’s effect in causing lung fibrosis. , froglets survived 42 days post-injury, with a continuous decrease in fibrosis. To explore this effect, we analyzed the distribution of lung stem cells; Sox9 protein levels and Sftp gene expression were downregulated at the alveoli 42 days post-injury. The decrease in stem cell marker expression 42 days post-injury suggests they are differentiating as part of the healing process. Nevertheless, we could still detect them after a few weeks of healing. These results suggest that , has a regenerative capacity for lung tissue repair and that the same signaling pathways and stem cells are active in both amphibians and mammalian lungs during lung growth, regeneration, and healing. These findings show for the first time the physiological similarities between the anuran and the mammalian lung during growth and tissue repair processes, suggesting , as a potential animal model to study lung regeneration."

It is therefore important to study WNT/β-catenin signalling directly in models of early human development. Since TCF/LEF factors mediate the regulation of target genes downstream of WNT/β-catenin signalling, we studied the expression and protein localisation of the four TCF/LEF genes by analysing , “snapshots” of human development, leveraging naïve and primed pluripotent cells as well as extraembryonic and early embryonic cell lineages. Strikingly, we comprehensively confirm clear differences between mouse and human pluripotent stem cells, suggesting species-specific requirements for WNT signalling that may reflect differences in states of pluripotency. Human naïve ES cells express very low TCF7L1, unlike their mouse counterparts. TCF7L2 is robustly expressed in human naïve ES-derived trophectoderm cells. In human primed pluripotent stem cells, activation of WNT/β-Catenin signalling is required to induce expression of both , and ,, concomitant with hallmark gastrulation markers.

Host-pathogen co-evolution can cause rapid diversification or loss of pathogen genes encoding host-exposed proteins. The molecular mechanisms that underpin such sequence dynamics remains poorly investigated at the scale of entire pathogen species. Here, we focus on AvrStb6, a major effector of the global wheat pathogen ,, evolving in response to the cognate receptor Stb6, a resistance widely deployed in wheat. We comprehensively captured effector gene evolution by analyzing a global thousand-genome panel using reference-free sequence analyses. We found that AvrStb6 has diversified into 59 protein isoforms with a strong association to the pathogen spreading to new continents. Across Europe, we found the strongest differentiation of the effector consistent with high rates of Stb6 deployment. The , locus showed also a remarkable diversification in transposable element content with specific expansion patterns across the globe. We detected the , gene losses and evidence for transposable element-mediated disruptions. We used genome-wide association mapping data to predict virulence emergence and found marked increases in Europe, followed by spread to subsequently colonized continents. Finally, we genotyped French bread wheat cultivars for Stb6 and monitored resistant cultivar deployment concomitant with AvrStb6 evolution. Taken together, our data provides a comprehensive view of how a rapidly diversifying effector locus can undergo large-scale sequence changes concomitant with gains in virulence on resistant cultivars. The analyses highlight also the need for large-scale pathogen sequencing panels to assess the durability of resistance genes and improve the sustainability of deployment strategies."

However, the existing reference genome for pigs is incomplete, with thousands of segments and missing centromeres and telomeres, which limits our understanding of the important traits in these genomic regions. To address this issue, we present a near complete genome assembly for the Jinhua pig (JH-T2T), constructed using PacBio HiFi and ONT long reads. This assembly includes all 18 autosomes and the X and Y sex chromosomes, with only six gaps. It features annotations of 46.90% repetitive sequences, 35 telomeres, 17 centromeres, and 23,924 high-confident genes. Compared to the Sscrofa11.1, JH-T2T closes nearly all gaps, extends sequences by 177 Mb, predicts more intact telomeres and centromeres, and gains 799 more genes and loses 114 genes. Moreover, it enhances the mapping rate for both Western and Chinese local pigs, outperforming Sscrofa11.1 as a reference genome. Additionally, this comprehensive genome assembly will facilitate large-scale variant detection and enable the exploration of genes associated with pig domestication, such as GPAM, CYP2C18, LY9, ITLN2, and CHIA.

Here, we show that highly efficient somatic knock-ins of long DNA fragments can be achieved in the developing chick neural tube in ovo. We compare different types of repair matrices and different methods for the delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 machinery, and find that an all plasmid-based approach and short arms of homology provide an easy and efficient method to achieve high frequencies of knock-in insertions with virtually no background signal. We use this method to target fluorescent reporters and dynamically monitor the subcellular distribution of endogenously expressed tagged proteins, as well as to insert the Gal4-VP16 transcription factor or the Cre recombinase at specific loci to label neural sub-populations in the chick embryonic spinal cord.

Developmental Biology,Cellular signalling protrusions enable dynamic distant contacts in spinal cord neurogenesis,"Joshua,Robert,Veronica,Nancy,Cerys,Joshua,Robert,Veronica,Nancy,Cerys,Joshua,Robert,Veronica,Nancy","In the developing mouse ventral spinal cord, HES5, a transcription factor downstream of Notch signalling, is expressed as evenly spaced clusters of high HES5-expressing neural progenitor cells along the dorsoventral axis. While Notch signalling requires direct membrane contact for its activation, we have previously shown mathematically that contact needs to extend beyond neighbouring cells for the HES5 pattern to emerge. However, the presence of cellular structures that could enable such long-distance signalling was unclear. Here, we report that cellular protrusions are present all along the apicobasal axis of individual neural progenitor cells. Through live imaging, we show that these protrusions dynamically extend and retract reaching lengths of up to ∼20μm, enough to extend membrane contact beyond adjacent cells. The Notch ligand DLL1 was found to colocalise with protrusions, further supporting the idea that Notch signalling can be transduced at a distance. The effect of protrusions on the HES5 pattern was tested by reducing the density of protrusions using the CDC42 inhibitor ML141, leading to a tendency to decrease the distance between high HES5 cell clusters. However, this tendency was not significant and leaves an open question about their role in the fine-grained organisation of neurogenesis."

Zygotic STAT3 is required for normal postimplantation development. On an outbred genetic background, , null embryos consistently lagged behind their littermates, beginning with significant reduction of epiblast cells at implantation. Remarkably, mutants closely resemble non-affected embryos from the previous day at all postimplantation stages examined. We pinpoint this phenotype to loss of the serine-phosphorylated form of STAT3 which predominates in postimplantation embryonic tissues. Bulk RNA-sequencing analysis of isolated mouse epiblasts confirmed , null embryos exhibited developmental delay transcriptionally. Single cell RNA sequencing of mid gestation chimaeras containing STAT3 null embryonic stem cells revealed exclusion of mutant cells exclusively from the erythroid lineage. Although Stat3 null embryonic stem cells can differentiate into erythroid and hematopoietic lineages in vitro, they are out-competed when mixed with wild type cells. Combined with the reduced size of STAT3 null epiblasts after implantation, our results implicate a role for STAT3 in cell proliferation affecting temporal control of embryonic progression and rapid differentiation."

Even though the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) provides recommendations for variant nomenclature,  discrepancies in annotation remain a significant hurdle. 
Methods: This study evaluated the annotation concordance between three tools-ANNOVAR, SnpEff, and Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)-using 164,549 two-star variants from ClinVar. The analysis used HGVS nomenclature string-match comparisons to assess annotation consistency from each tool, corresponding coding impacts, and associated ACMG criteria inferred from the annotations.
Results: The analysis revealed variable concordance rates, with 58.52% agreement for HGVSc, 84.04% for HGVSp, and 85.58% for the coding impact. SnpEff showed the highest match for HGVSc (0.988), while VEP bettered for HGVSp (0.977). The substantial discrepancies were noted in the Loss-of-Function (LoF) category. Incorrect PVS1 interpretations affected the final pathogenicity and downgraded PLP variants (ANNOVAR 55.9%, SnpEff 66.5%, VEP 67.3%), risking false negatives of clinically relevant variants in reports. 
Conclusions: These findings highlight the critical challenges in accurately interpreting variant pathogenicity due to discrepancies in annotations. To enhance the reliability of genetic variant interpretation in clinical practice, standardizing transcript sets and systematically cross-validating results across multiple annotation tools is essential."
Developmental Biology, suppresses terminal differentiation of migratory eye progenitors in planarian regeneration,"Katherine C.,Christian P.,Katherine C.,Christian P.,Katherine C.","Proper stem cell targeting and differentiation is necessary for regeneration to succeed. In organisms capable of whole body regeneration, considerable progress has been made identifying wound signals initiating this process, but the mechanisms that control the differentiation of progenitors into mature organs are not fully understood. Using the planarian as a model system, we identify a novel function for , a MAP3K family member possessing both kinase and ubiquitin ligase domains, to negatively regulate terminal differentiation of stem cells during eye regeneration. Inhibition of , caused the formation of multiple ectopic eyes within the head, but without controlling overall head, brain, or body patterning. By contrast, other known regulators of planarian eye patterning like , and , also regulate head regionalization, suggesting , acts distinctly. Eye resection and regeneration experiments suggest that unlike Wnt signaling perturbation, , inhibition did not shift the target destination of eye formation in the animal. Instead, , ectopic eyes emerge in the regions normally occupied by migratory eye progenitors, and the onset of ectopic eyes after , inhibition coincides with a reduction to eye progenitor numbers. Furthermore, RNAi dosing experiments indicate that progenitors closer to their normal target are relatively more sensitive to the effects of , implicating this factors in controlling the site of terminal differentiation.

Developmental Biology,The ,"Colby K.,Victoria C.,Kenneth H.,Colby K.,Victoria C.,Kenneth H.,Colby K.,Victoria C.","Rapidly dividing cells can eliminate slow growing neighbors through the apoptotic process of cell competition. This process ensures that only high fitness cells populate embryonic tissues and is proposed to underlie the ability of oncogene-transformed cells to progressively replace normal cells within a tissue. Patches of cells in the , wing disc overexpressing the oncogenic Taiman (Tai) transcriptional coactivator kill normal neighbors by secreting Spz ligands that trigger pro-apoptotic Toll signaling in receiving cells. However, extracellular signaling mechanisms responsible for elimination of slow growing cells by normal neighbors remain poorly defined. Here we show that slow growing cells with reduced Tai (Tai,) are killed by normal neighbors through a mechanism involving competition for the Wingless (Wg/Wnt) ligand. Elevated Wg signaling significantly rescues elimination of Tai, cells in multiple organs, suggesting that Tai may normally promote Wg activity. Examining distribution of Wg components reveals that Tai promotes extracellular spread of the Wg ligand from source cells across the wing disc, thus ensuring patterned expression of multiple Wg-regulated target genes. Tai controls Wg spread indirectly through the extracellular glypican Dally-like protein (Dlp), which binds Wg and promotes its extracellular diffusion and capture by receptors. Data indicate that Tai likely controls Dlp at two levels: transcription of , mRNA and Dlp intracellular trafficking. Overall, these data indicate that the Tai acts through Dlp to enable Wg transport and signaling, and that cell competition in the Tai, model arises due to inequity in the ability of epithelial cells to sequester limiting amounts of the Wg growth factor."

PRMT5 is a type II protein arginine methyltransferase that regulates several tumorigenic events in many cancer types. However, the regulation of PRMT5 and its direct implication on aberrant alternative splicing under hypoxia remains unexplored. In this study, we observed hypoxia induced upregulation of PRMT5 via the CCCTC binding factor, CTCF. Further, PRMT5-mediated symmetric arginine dimethylation H4R3me2s and H3R8me2s directly regulated the alternative splicing of Transcription Factor 3 (TCF3). Under hypoxia, PRMT5-mediated histone dimethylation at the intronic conserved region (ICR) present between TCF3 exon 18a and exon 18b recruits DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), resulting in DNA methylation. DNA methylation at the TCF3-ICR is recognized and bound by Methyl CpG binding protein (MECP2) resulting in RNA-Pol II pausing, promoting the recruitment of the negative splicing factor PTBP1 to the splicing locus of TCF3 mRNA. PTBP1 promotes the exclusion of exon 18a which results in the production of the pro-invasive TCF3-18B (E47) isoform which promotes EMT and invasion of breast cancer cells under hypoxia. Collectively, our results indicate PRMT5-mediated symmetric arginine dimethylation of histones regulates alternative splicing of TCF3 gene thereby enhancing EMT and invasion in breast cancer hypoxia."
Ecology,Application of a Bayesian model based on probability of occurrence to evaluate the effect of an environmental gradient on the turnover of aquatic insect genera in Cerrado streams,"Bruno Spacek,Sara,Leandro Goncalves,Bruno Spacek,Sara,Leandro Goncalves,Bruno Spacek,Sara","In ecology, understanding and quantifying the species turnover rates among different locations is essential for a more concise and predictive science. However, little is known about how the turnover occurs among environmentally similar locations and how it may be related to habitat integrity. Using the communities of Ephemoptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera sampled from streams in the Brazilian Cerrado, we tested the following hypotheses: a) genus turnover between similar streams will higher in more preserved streams; b) the relationship between proportional genus turnover and the environment is influenced by the taxonomic group. We estimated parameters related to the number of potentials, observed, and alternation of these genera across a habitat integrity gradient in 101 observed streams using a model with Bayesian inference. Genera turnover among environmentally similar sites was directly related to the environmental integrity of the stream. Only the genera Plecoptera showed a pattern similar to the hypothesis we elaborated, showing an increased turnover among well-preserved streams. For the other orders, the turnover presented two peaks in the environmental gradient, one in impacted sites and the other in preserved ones."
Developmental Biology,The evolutionary modifications of a GoLoco motif in the AGS protein facilitate micromere formation in the sea urchin embryo,"Natsuko,Florence D.M.,Annaliese,Mamiko,Natsuko,Florence D.M.,Annaliese,Mamiko,Natsuko,Florence D.M.,Annaliese","The evolutionary introduction of asymmetric cell division (ACD) into the developmental program facilitates the formation of a new cell type, contributing to developmental diversity and, eventually, to species diversification. The micromere of the sea urchin embryo may serve as one of those examples: An ACD at the 16-cell stage forms micromeres unique to echinoids among echinoderms. We previously reported that a polarity factor, Activator of G-protein Signaling (AGS), plays a crucial role in micromere formation. However, AGS and its associated ACD factors are present in all echinoderms and across most metazoans, leaving a question of what evolutionary modification of AGS protein or its surrounding molecular environment contributed to the evolutionary acquisition of micromeres only in echinoids. In this study, we learned that the GoLoco motifs at the AGS C-terminus play critical roles in regulating micromere formation in sea urchin embryos. Further, other echinoderms AGS or chimeric AGS that contain the C-terminus of AGS orthologs from various organisms showed varied localization and function in micromere formation. In contrast, the sea star or the pencil urchin orthologs of other ACD factors were consistently localized at the vegetal cortex in the sea urchin embryo, suggesting that AGS may be a unique variable factor that facilitates ACD diversity among echinoderms. Consistently, sea urchin AGS appears to facilitate micromere-like cell formation and accelerate the enrichment timing of the germline factor Vasa during early embryogenesis of the pencil urchin, an ancestral type of sea urchin. Based on these observations, we propose that the molecular evolution of a single polarity factor facilitates ACD diversity while preserving the core ACD machinery among echinoderms and beyond during evolution."

Genetics,The cGAS-STING pathway is an in vivo modifier of genomic instability syndromes,"Marva,Uri,Tehila,Gwendoline,Ryan,Hosniyah,Eitan,Aaron J.J.,Bèrènice A.,Yehuda,Ido,Itamar,Marva,Uri,Tehila,Gwendoline,Ryan,Hosniyah,Eitan,Aaron J.J.,Bèrènice A.,Yehuda,Ido,Itamar,Marva,Uri,Tehila,Gwendoline,Ryan,Hosniyah,Eitan,Aaron J.J.,Bèrènice A.,Yehuda,Ido","Mutations in genes involved in DNA damage repair (DDR) often lead to premature aging syndromes. While recent evidence suggests that inflammation, alongside mutation accumulation and cell death, may drive disease phenotypes, its precise contribution to in-vivo pathophysiology remains unclear. Here, by modeling Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T) and Bloom Syndrome in the African turquoise killifish (N. furzeri), we replicate key phenotypes of DDR syndromes, including infertility, cytoplasmic DNA fragments, and reduced lifespan. The link between DDR defects and inflammation is attributed to the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and interferon signaling by cytoplasmic DNA. Accordingly, mutating cGAS partially rescues germline defects and senescence in A-T fish. Double mutants also display reversal of telomere abnormalities and suppression of transposable elements, underscoring cGAS's non-canonical role as a DDR inhibitor. Our findings emphasize the role of interferon signaling in A-T pathology and identify the cGAS-STING pathway as a potential therapeutic target for genomic instability syndromes."
Genomics,"Genetic diversity, population structure and differentiation of farmed and wild African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) in Nigeria","Mark K,Neil B.,Maria,Jenna,Barbara K,Mark K,Neil B.,Maria,Jenna,Barbara K,Mark K,Neil B.,Maria,Jenna","The African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) is a commercially important species, for both fisheries and aquaculture, and is now the most commonly farmed fish in sub-Saharan Africa. However, knowledge about the genetic diversity and population structure of wild and farmed populations, which is crucial for effective conservation and sustainable aquaculture management, is scarce. Using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene (COI) sequencing and genomic analysis using triple restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (3RAD), we investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of farmed and wild C. gariepinus populations from Nigeria, including an albino form found in the wild. Eleven COI haplotypes were identified, of which seven were unique to wild samples. Wild sampling sites had a slightly broader range and higher maximum values for observed heterozygosity (Ho = 0.109 to 0.165), expected heterozygosity (He = 0.111 to 0.216), and nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.125 to 0.225) compared to the farmed populations (Ho = 0.118 to 0.147, He = 0.112 to 0.144, pi = 0.117 to 0.151). Conversely, genetic differentiation (Fst) was higher among farmed sampling sites compared to the wild ones and there was high genetic differentiation between the farmed and wild C. gariepinus sampling sites (Fst = 0.31 to 0.47). Despite evidence for admixture for both farmed and wild fish, there was little evidence of admixture between the two groups.  Nevertheless, both mtDNA and 3RAD data strongly suggested that the albino fish, collected from the wild, were in fact farm escapees. Despite overall differentiation farmed genotypes suggesting that overall genetic integrity of wild fish has been maintained, this evidence of escape provides a warning about potential risks of increasing aquaculture activities. Specifically, this indicates the need for greater regulation of fish farms to monitor and reduce the risk of escapes."
Cancer Biology,Ductal pancreatic cancer interception by FGFR2 abrogation,"Claudia,Astrid,Victoria,Amanda,Nandan,Melissa A.,Zhen,Youngkyu,David,Claudia,Astrid,Victoria,Amanda,Nandan,Melissa A.,Zhen,Youngkyu,David,Claudia,Astrid,Victoria,Amanda,Nandan,Melissa A.,Zhen,Youngkyu","Activating KRAS mutations are a key feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) and drive tumor initiation and progression. However, mutant KRAS by itself is weakly oncogenic. The pathways that cooperate with mutant KRAS to induce tumorigenesis are less-defined. Analyzing organoids and murine and human pancreatic specimens, we found that the receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR2 was progressively up-regulated in mutant KRAS-driven metaplasia, pre-neoplasia and Classical PDA. Using genetic mouse models, we showed that FGFR2 supported mutant KRAS-driven transformation of acinar cells by promoting proliferation and MAPK pathway activation. FGFR2 abrogation significantly delayed tumor formation and extended the survival of these mice. Furthermore, we discovered that FGFR2 collaborated with EGFR and dual blockade of these receptor signaling pathways significantly reduced mutant KRAS-induced pre-neoplastic lesion formation.
Together, our data have uncovered a pivotal role for FGFR2 in the early phases of pancreatic tumorigenesis, paving the way for future therapeutic applications of FGFR2 inhibitors for pancreatic cancer interception."
Evolutionary Biology,The body size and fitness match and its variability in plastic response to temperature,"Antoni,Agata,Katarzyna,Franek,Aleksandra,Antoni,Agata,Katarzyna,Franek,Aleksandra,Antoni,Agata,Katarzyna,Franek","The ability of organisms to respond plastically to environmental change remains one of the most challenging areas of ecological studies. Reasons for this include the complex nature of environmental cues and responses at the organismal level, the costs that organisms face in performing phenotypic plasticity under different conditions, and the individual capacity to respond, which depends on many internal and external factors. The special case in this regard is an example of the plastic body size response to temperature, known as the Temperature-Size Rule (TSR). We used five clonal and three multiclonal experimental populations of the Lecane inermis rotifer. We measured two traits over a wide thermal range: body size and population growth rate r. We investigated (i) the thermal conditions under which different experimental populations perform the TSR or canalize (= no plasticity) their body size, (ii) how this response relates to a direct measure of fitness, and (iii) whether this response varies with the thermal preferences of the studied organisms. We found a relationship between body size and fitness, confirming that the TSR is only performed within a certain thermal range, beyond which body size is canalized. We did not find the expected relationship between the strength of the TSR and the range of thermal tolerance, but our results do not allow us to reject the existence of such a relationship. Additionally, we found a relatively high repeatability of thermal tolerance in experimental populations in comparison with the previous studies. Finally, we suggest the role of the level of genetic composition within a population in its ability to respond plastically to temperature. This is the first study to describe in detail the special case of plasticity versus canalization, for body size response to optimal and suboptimal temperatures, in organisms that differ in their tolerance to temperature."
Ecology,NicheFlow: Towards a foundation model for Species Distribution Modelling,"Russell,Russell","Species distribution models (SDMs) are crucial tools for understanding and predicting biodiversity patterns, yet they often struggle with limited data, biased sampling, and complex species-environment relationships. Here I present NicheFlow, a novel foundation model for SDMs that leverages generative AI to address these challenges and advance our ability to model and predict species distributions across taxa and environments.
NicheFlow employs a two-stage generative approach, combining species embeddings with two chained generative models, one to generate a distribution in environmental space, and a second to generate a distribution in geographic space. This architecture allows for the sharing of information across species and captures complex, non-linear relationships in environmental space. I trained NicheFlow on a comprehensive dataset of reptile distributions and evaluated its performance using both standard SDM metrics and zero-shot prediction tasks.
NicheFlow demonstrates good predictive performance, particularly for rare and data-deficient species. The model successfully generated plausible distributions for species not seen during training, showcasing its potential for zero-shot prediction. The learned species embeddings captured meaningful ecological information, revealing patterns in niche structure across taxa, latitude and range sizes.
As a proof-of-principle foundation model, NicheFlow represents a significant advance in species distribution modeling, offering a powerful tool for addressing pressing questions in ecology, evolution, and conservation biology. Its ability to model joint species distributions and generate hypothetical niches opens new avenues for exploring ecological and evolutionary questions, including ancestral niche reconstruction and community assembly processes. This approach has the potential to transform our understanding of biodiversity patterns and improve our capacity to predict and manage species distributions in the face of global change."

Methods: Male immunodeficient mice (SCID) were castrated and subcutaneously inoculated with human CWR-22RV1 cancer cells to construct CRPC xenograft model before randomly assigned to either voluntary wheel running (VWR) or sedentary (SED) group (n=6/group). After three weeks, tumor tissues were collected. Tumor size was measured and calculated. mRNA expression of markers of DNA replication, Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling, and mitochondrial dynamics was determined by RT-PCR. Protein expression of mitochondrial content and dynamics was determined by western blotting. Finally, RNA-sequencing analysis was performed in the tumor tissues. Results: Voluntary wheel running resulted in smaller tumor volume at the initial stage and attenuated tumor progression throughout the time course (P < 0.05). The reduction of tumor volume in VWR group was coincided with lower mRNA expression of DNA replication markers (MCM2, MCM6, and MCM7), AR signaling (ELOVL5 and FKBP5) and regulatory proteins of mitochondrial fission (Drp1 and Fis1) and fusion (MFN1 and OPA1) when compared to the SED group (P<0.05). More importantly, RNA sequencing data further revealed that pathways related to pathways related to angiogenesis, extracellular matrix formation and endothelial cell proliferation were downregulated. Conclusions: Three weeks of VWR was effective in delaying tumor initiation and progression, which coincided with reduced transcription of DNA replication, AR signaling targets and mitochondrial dynamics. We further identified reduced molecular pathways/processes related to angiogenesis that may be responsible for the delayed tumor initiation and progression by VWR."

Developmental Biology,The ,"Kara A,Kari F,Lauren,Stephen,Kara A,Kari F,Lauren,Stephen,Kara A,Kari F,Lauren","Niches are often found in specific positions in tissues relative to the stem cells they support. Consistency of niche position suggests that placement is important for niche function. However, the complexity of most niches has precluded a thorough understanding of how their proper placement is established. To address this, we investigated the formation of a genetically tractable niche, the Drosophila Posterior Signaling Center (PSC), the assembly of which had not been previously explored. This niche controls hematopoietic progenitors of the lymph gland (LG). PSC cells were previously shown to be specified laterally in the embryo, but ultimately reside dorsally, at the LG posterior. Here, using live-imaging, we show that PSC cells migrate as a tight collective and associate with multiple tissues during their trajectory to the LG posterior. We find that Slit emanating from two extrinsic sources, visceral mesoderm and cardioblasts, is required for the PSC to remain a collective, and for its attachment to cardioblasts during migration. Without proper Slit-Robo signaling, PSC cells disperse, form aberrant contacts, and ultimately fail to reach their stereotypical position near progenitors. Our work characterizes a novel example of niche formation and identifies an extrinsic signaling relay that controls precise niche positioning."
Evolutionary Biology,Females drive postmating reproductive trait evolution across ,"Brooke,Leonie C.,Brooke,Leonie C.,Brooke","While traits that contribute to premating sexual interactions are known to be wildly diverse, much less is known about the diversity of postmating (especially female) reproductive traits and the mechanisms shaping this diversity. To assess the rate, pattern, and potential drivers of postmating reproductive trait evolution, we analyzed male and female traits across up to 30 , species within a phylogenetic comparative framework. In addition to postmating reproductive morphology (e.g., sperm length, reproductive tract length and mass), we also quantified mating behaviors including female remating rate—a common proxy for the strength of postmating sexual selection. We found evidence for strong coevolution between male and female postmating traits (specifically sperm length and sperm storage organ size). However, remating rate was not associated with the rate of evolution or exaggeration of either male or female postmating reproductive morphology, once phylogenetic relatedness was accounted for. We infer that female-mediated and intersexual selection predominantly drive the evolution of our postmating morphological traits, including via divergent male and female interests in controlling paternity. In comparison, remating rate has a complex and likely secondary role in shaping this evolution, in part because this trait can be both a driver and a product of postmating selection."

Investigations of the consequences of violating these assumptions so far have focused on individual perturbations operating in isolation. Here, we analyze widely used estimators of genetic architectural parameters, including LD-score regression and both population-based and within-family GWAS, across a broad array of perturbations to classical assumptions, such as multivariate assortative mating and vertical transmission (parental effects on offspring phenotypes not mediated by genetic inheritance). We find that widely-used statistical approaches are unreliable across a broad range of perturbations, and that structural sources of confounding often operate synergistically to distort conclusions. For example, mild multivariate assortative mating and vertical transmission together can dramatically inflate heritability estimates and GWAS false positive rates. Further, GWAS will become progressively more polluted by off-target associations as sample sizes increase. Given these challenges, we introduce xftsim, a forward time simulation library capable of modeling a wide range of genetic architectures, mating regimes, and transmission dynamics, to facilitate the systematic comparison of existing approaches and the development of robust methods. Together, our findings illustrate the importance of comprehensive sensitivity analysis and present a valuable tool for future research."

Ecology,Survey of Lichen Diversity and Abundance in a Florida Scrub in Relation to Various Temporal Stages of Burn Recovery,"Meghan M,Cassidy M,Christy K,Meghan M,Cassidy M,Christy K,Meghan M,Cassidy M","With the increased use of prescribed burns in recent years, it is critical to understand their impacts not only on their primary target species, but also on the entire biological community.  Lichen have intricate symbioses with other neighboring organisms and provide important ecosystem services. In prairie and grassland environments, the prescribed burns may result in the extirpation of some ground-dwelling species of lichen. However, the impacts of fire schedules on the lichen recovery in Florida scrub remains unknown. The dry, sandy scrub ecosystem houses the only federally endangered lichen in the state, the Florida perforate lichen (Cladonia perforata). As scrub communities are adapted to the presence of fire, prescribed burns are now a routine management practice. Lichen has a key role in early plant succession following fire, influencing the health of Florida scrub. We used a modified Feests method to survey the effects of fire regime on terrestrial lichen abundance and diversity in the Lakeland Highlands Scrub, an area of scrub habitat in Polk County in Central Florida. The speed and comparable accuracy of Feests method render it an accessible means of assessing biodiversity for land management in protected areas. We estimated percent cover of lichen and estimated species diversity using the Lichen Diversity Value (LDV) in four areas of scrub and scrubby flatwoods habitat with different burn histories (unburned, two years, eight years, and ten years since last burn). According to the LDV calculations, diversity is highest in the most extreme temporal groups, contradicting our initial prediction that lichen diversity and abundance would be greatest in the intermediately disturbed areas (two and eight years post burn). These preliminary data suggest implementing prescribed burns more frequently in this scrub habitat would allow lichen communities a greater opportunity to recover. Our study yields beneficial information to assist future decisions made regarding the frequency of fire regimes within the Florida scrublands habitat. Methods of protecting lichen may also be recommended, such as collecting and removing lichen prior to a burn, and returning those lichen samples to the area after (e.g. Remove and Return)."

Here, we develop a nascent RNA assay (PReCIS-seq) that measures lineage-specific transcriptionally-engaged Pol II on genes and DNA enhancer elements in intact mouse tissue. By employing keratinocytes as a prototype lineage, we unearth Pol II promoter-recruitment versus pause-release mechanisms operating in adult skin homeostasis. Moreover, we relate active enhancer proximity and transcription factor binding motifs on promoters to Pol II activity and promoter-proximal pausing level. Finally, we find Pol II firing rapidly into elongation on lineage identity genes and highly paused on cellular safeguarding genes in a context-dependent manner. Our work provides a basic platform to investigate mechanistic principles of gene regulation in individual lineages of complex mammalian tissues."
Genomics,ybx1 acts upstream of atoh1a to promote the rapid regeneration of hair cells in zebrafish lateral-line neuromasts,"Caleb C.,A. J.,Caleb C.,A. J.,Caleb C.","Like the sensory organs of the human inner ear, the lateral-line neuromasts (NMs) of fish such as the zebrafish (Danio rerio) contain mechanosensory hair cells (HCs) that are surrounded by progenitors called supporting cells. Damaged NMs can quickly regenerate new HCs by expressing in the progenitors HC-specific genes such as atoh1a, the master regulator of HC fate. We used the supervised learning algorithm DELAY to infer regenerating NMs' early gene-regulatory network (GRN) and identify adaptations that promote the rapid regeneration of lateral-line HCs in larval zebrafish. The central hub in the network, Y-box binding protein 1 (ybx1), is highly expressed in HC progenitors and young HCs and can recognize DNA-binding motifs in cyprinids' candidate regeneration-responsive promoter elements for atoh1a. We showed that NMs from ybx1 mutant zebrafish larvae display consistent, regeneration-specific deficits in HC number and initiate both HC regeneration and atoh1a expression 20 % slower than in siblings. By demonstrating that ybx1 promotes rapid HC regeneration through early atoh1a upregulation, the results support DELAY's ability to identify key temporal regulators of gene expression."
Ecology,Functional and evolutionary characterization of potential auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) of the global RNA virome,"Yang,Zhihao,Pengfei,Meiling,Rong,Yongqin,Yang,Zhihao,Pengfei,Meiling,Rong,Yongqin,Yang,Zhihao,Pengfei,Meiling,Rong","RNA viruses play an important role in regulating their host and global biogeochemical cycling, and auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) are one of the main pathways by which viruses regulate hosts metabolism. However, the AMGs encoded by global RNA viruses are largely unexplored. Here, we annotated RNA viral genomes and identified AMGs from recently published global RNA virome datasets. We found 274 AMGs encoded by 243 RNA viral genomes, which accounts for only 0.008% of all 3,216,257 genomes investigated. These AMGs span 25 functional categories, the most prevalent being translation, energy metabolism, membrane transport, transcription, replication and repair, and signal transduction. Unlike DNA viruses, RNA viruses tend to encode AMGs influencing the genetic and environments information processing of their hosts, with fewer AMGs linked to nutrient cycling, such as carbon and nitrogen metabolism. In addition, RNA viruses encoding these AMGs were taxonomically diverse, spanning five established phyla, the newly proposed phylum ""Taraviricota"" and fourteen LucaProt supergroups. Host prediction indicated that most of these RNA viruses encoding AMGs infect eukaryotes, while only a few of them, including , and ,, infect prokaryotes. Interestingly, the potential host phylum for most of these RNA viruses were different from the likely source phylum of their AMGs, suggesting the possibility that these RNA viruses acquired AMGs from organisms outside their predicted host range. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of AMGs from global RNA virome, which greatly expands our understanding of their function roles, evolutionary history and virus-host interactions."
Cancer Biology,The Src family kinase inhibitor drug Dasatinib and glucocorticoids display synergistic activity against tongue squamous cell carcinoma and reduce MET kinase activity,"Ali N.A.,Jessica,Daniel,Stephan M.,Marc,Ali N.A.,Jessica,Daniel,Stephan M.,Marc,Ali N.A.,Jessica,Daniel,Stephan M.","Background: Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) is an aggressive cancer associated with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options, necessitating new drug targets to improve therapeutic outcomes. Our current work focuses on protein tyrosine kinases as well-known targets for successful cancer therapies.
Methods: Western blot analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation patterns in 34 TSCC lines identified Src family kinases (SFKs) as the main contributors. Inhibition of SFKs with PP2 and Dasatinib led to profound biological effects. A high-throughput screen with 1600 FDA-approved drugs was performed with three TSCC lines to discover drugs that act synergistically with Dasatinib against TSCC cell viability. Glucocorticoids emerged as potential candidates and were further investigated in 2D culture and by 3D soft agar colony formation. Dexamethasone was chosen as the major tool for our analyses. Since Dasatinib and glucocorticoids are known for their pleiotropic actions on cells, we analyzed effects on cell cycle, senescence, autophagy and cell signaling.
Results: A panel of 34 TSCC lines showed a surprisingly homogenous pTyr-protein pattern and a prominent 130 kDa pTyr-protein. Inhibition of SFK activity greatly reduced overall pTyr-protein levels and p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation. It also impaired TSCC viability in 2D cell culture and 3D soft agar colony formation. A high-throughput drug combination screen with Dasatinib identified glucocorticoids as promising candidates for synergistic activity. Dasatinib and Dexamethasone combination treatment showed strong synergistic effects on Src and p130Cas phosphorylation and led to reduced p130Cas expression. Dexamethasone also suppressed phosphorylation of the MET kinase and its key substrate Gab1. On the cellular level, Dasatinib combination with glucocorticoids led to G1 cell cycle arrest, increased senescence and enhanced autophagy. This was also reflected by effects on cell cycle regulatory proteins, including CDKs and cyclins.
Conclusion: This work is the first to show a strong synergistic activity of Dasatinib in combination with clinically used glucocorticoids in solid tumors. Furthermore, the tyrosine kinase MET and its effector protein Gab1 are newly identified glucocorticoid targets. Given the extensive research on MET as a drug target in various cancers, our findings have the potential to advance future cancer treatments.

Here, we used machine learning models to explore genotype-phenotype connections for 223 life history traits measured across 1011 genome-sequenced Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. Firstly, we used genome-wide association studies to connect genetic variants with the phenotypes. Next, we benchmarked an automated machine learning pipeline that includes preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameters optimization in combination with multiple linear and complex machine learning methods. We determined gradient boosting machines as best performing in 65% of predictions and pangenome as best predictor, suggesting a considerable contribution of the accessory genome in controlling phenotypes. The accuracy broadly varied among the phenotypes (r = 0.2-0.9), consistent with varying levels of complexity, with stress resistance being easier to predict compared to growth across carbon and nitrogen nutrients. While no specific genomic features could be linked to the predictions for most phenotypes, machine learning identifies high-impact variants with established relationships to phenotypes despite being rare in the population. Near-perfect accuracies (r>0.95) were achieved when other phenomics data were used to aid predictions, suggesting shared useful information can be conveyed across phenotypes. Overall, our study underscores the power of machine learning to interpret the functional outcome of genetic variants."
Evolutionary Biology,Exposure to complex mixtures of urban sediments containing Tyre and Road Wear Particles (TRWPs) increases the germ-line mutation rate in Chironomus riparius,"Lorenzo,Markus,Volker,Martin,Henner,Markus,Lorenzo,Markus,Volker,Martin,Henner,Markus,Lorenzo,Markus,Volker,Martin,Henner","Tyre and road wear particles (TRWPs) are a significant yet often underestimated source of environmental pollution, contributing to the accumulation of microplastics and a complex mixture of contaminants in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Despite their prevalence, the long-term evolutionary effects of TRWPs, beyond their immediate toxicity, remain largely unknown. In this study, we assessed mutagenicity in the non-biting midge Chironomus riparius, upon exposure to urban sediment collected from a runoff sedimentation basin. To assess the extent of mutagenic effects over multiple generations, we combined the urban sediment exposure model with short-term mutation accumulation lines (MALs) and subsequent whole genome sequencing (WGS). Our results reveal that the exposure to urban sediment significantly increases mutation rates compared to control groups by 50%, independent of concentration (0.5% and 10%). To infer potential causal processes, we conducted a comparative analysis with known mutational spectra from experiments with other studies. This comparison showed that the mutation profiles induced by urban sediment clearly clustered with those caused by Benzo[a]Pyrene (BaP), a known polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). A comprehensive chemical characterization of the sediment confirmed a considerable impact of road runoff and traffic-related contamination, including PAHs of primarily petrogenic origin. This suggests that PAH-like compounds present in urban sediments may play a significant role in the observed mutagenic effects. Our study shows that urban sediments influence mutation rates and alter mutational spectra in exposed organisms, potentially compromising genomic stability and shaping evolutionary trajectories. Additionally, we show that comparatively analysing mutational spectra may provide valuable insights into mutational processes. These genetic changes may have profound long-term effects on population dynamics and ecosystem health, underscoring the importance of understanding the evolutionary consequences of environmental pollution."
Epidemiology,Cohort-based smoothing methods for age-specific contact rates,"Yannick,Oswaldo,Christel,Carlo G.,Niel,Yannick,Oswaldo,Christel,Carlo G.,Niel,Yannick,Oswaldo,Christel,Carlo G.","The use of social contact rates is widespread in infectious disease modeling since it has been shown that they are key driving forces of important epidemiological parameters. Quantification of contact patterns is crucial to parametrize dynamic transmission models and to provide insights on the (basic) reproduction number. Information on social interactions, can (for instance) be obtained from population-based contact surveys, such as the European Commission project POLYMOD. Estimation of age-specific contact rates from these studies is often done using a piecewise constant approach or bivariate smoothing techniques. For the latter, typically, smoothing is done in the dimensions of the respondent’s and contact’s age. We propose a new flexible strategy based on a smoothing constrained approach - taking into account the reciprocal nature of contacts - where the contact rates are assumed smooth from a cohort perspective as well as from the age distribution of contacts. This is achieved by smoothing over the diagonal components (including all subdiagonals) of the social contact matrix. This approach is supported by the fact that people age with time and thus motivates smoothly varying contact rates from a cohort angle. Two approaches that allow for smoothing of social contact data over cohorts are proposed namely, (1) reordering of the diagonal components of the social contact matrix; and (2) reordering of the penalty matrix associated with the diagonal components. Parameter estimation is done in the likelihood framework by using constrained penalized iterative reweighted least squares (C-PIRLS), under Poisson and negative Binomial distributional assumptions for the observed contacts.

Genomics,Heritable non-genetic phenotypes are enriched for stress responses as a form of bet hedging,"Spencer,Zachary,Abhyudai,Mark,Spencer,Zachary,Abhyudai,Mark,Spencer,Zachary,Abhyudai","During manufacturing batches, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells encounter critical levels of environmental stressors such as ammonia, lactate, and osmolality accumulation that can significantly reduce cell health and productivity. It is therefore crucial that stress adaptation and resistance be factored into cell line development (CLD). In this study, we employee population-based transcriptomic and differential gene expression analysis on stress-induced CHO cells to identify biomarkers displaying both heritable and stress-responsive properties. Using this workflow, 199 genes displayed transcriptional variability characteristic of a bistable system that formed four network communities of co-fluctuating genes. These communities were enriched in genes related to the regulation of apoptotic processes and gene expression/metabolic pathways. Seven genes were identified as promising biomarkers for engineering a stress-resistant phenotype. Genetic engineering methods may be employed in the future to bias clonal populations for higher stress tolerance to manufacturing stress, therefore increasing cell health and productivity in at-scale bioreactors."

Evolutionary Biology,The biogeography of evolutionary radiations on oceanic archipelagos,"Baptiste,Thomas J.,Jose Maria,Christian,Kostas A.,Robert J.,Francois,Baptiste,Thomas J.,Jose Maria,Christian,Kostas A.,Robert J.,Francois,Baptiste,Thomas J.,Jose Maria,Christian,Kostas A.,Robert J.","Evolutionary radiations on oceanic archipelagos (ROAs) have long served as models for understanding evolutionary and ecological processes underlying species diversification. Yet, diversity patterns emerging from ROAs have received relatively little attention from biogeographers, even though characterizing the effect of key geo-environmental factors on island clades species distribution could be important for unraveling diversification dynamics. In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis using island-specific species richness values for approximately one hundred ROAs across major oceanic archipelagos (mostly Hawaii, Canary Islands, Galapagos and Fiji) and taxa (vascular plants, invertebrates and vertebrates). Our aim was to determine whether (1) ROA species richness patterns scale as a function of key geo-environmental factors including island area, geological age, environmental heterogeneity (elevation and topographic complexity) and inter-island isolation, and (2) whether the magnitude of the effects of these factors varies across archipelagos and taxa. Our results identified elevation as a key driver of ROA species richness patterns on islands, supporting existing theoretical and empirical work that highlighted the central role of environmental heterogeneity in driving diversification on oceanic islands. As importantly, we found that the influence of geo-environmental factors varies across archipelagos and taxa, suggesting that unique archipelagic dynamics and biological traits together shape diversification differently. Our findings emphasize the value of applying biogeographical modeling at resolution of individual radiations to improve our understanding of evolutionary processes on oceanic archipelagos."
Ecology,A simple model of population dynamics with beneficial and harmful interaction networks for empirical applications.,"Malyon Diana,Luz Valerie,Matthew Philip,Christopher M,Malyon Diana,Luz Valerie,Matthew Philip,Christopher M,Malyon Diana,Luz Valerie,Matthew Philip","Population dynamic models can forecast changes in the abundances of multiple interconnected species, which makes them potentially powerful tools for managing ecological communities, yet they remain largely under-utilised in applied settings. High data requirements and the ability to only model a narrow range of ecological interactions and/or trophic levels together limits their usefulness when faced with complex and data-poor systems, where beneficial (e.g. mutualism) and harmful (e.g. competition) interactions may operate simultaneously within and between species. We present a model of population dynamics that can describe a wide range of ecological interaction outcomes with a simple, unified structure. Species growth rates are constrained by a maximum growth rate parameter which prevents the risk of population explosions even in the case of mutualism. Species interactions are defined by two, not mutually-exclusive interactions matrices that describe the effects of beneficial and harmful interactions respectively, together providing the potential for the net effect of interactions between one species and another to switch from beneficial to harmful as population density increases. This model recreates classic dynamics in two-species mutualistic, competitive, and predator-prey scenarios, allowing us to model a wide range of trophic levels and interaction types together within the same equation. The maximum growth rate parameter, theoretically based in intrinsic constraints on reproduction, can be parameterised from a wide range of sources including natural history, historical data, and breeding programs. We illustrate the potential of this model with a data-poor case study of a threatened species and two interacting predators. This new model is generaliseable to a wide range of natural ecological communities. Its model structure lowers data requirements whilst remaining intuitive and biologically realistic, making it an accessible option for predicting community-wide population changes in applied contexts where data is sparse and/or uncertain."

Here, we investigate how the microenvironment of the injured cerebellum changes upon injury and contributes to the regenerative potential of normally gliogenic,NEPs and their adaptive reprogramming. Single cell transcriptomic and bulk chromatin accessibility analyses of the NEPs from injured neonatal cerebella compared to controls show a temporary increase in cellular processes involved in responding to reactive oxygen species (ROS), a known damage-associated molecular pattern. Analysis of ROS levels in cerebellar tissue confirm a transient increased one day after injury at postanal day 1, overlapping with the peak cell death in the cerebellum. In a transgenic mouse line that ubiquitously overexpresses human mitochondrial catalase (mCAT), ROS is reduced 1 day after injury to the granule cell progenitors, and we demonstrate that several steps in the regenerative process of NEPs are curtailed leading to reduced cerebellar growth. We also provide evidence that microglia are involved in one step of adaptive reprogramming by regulating NEP replenishment of the granule cell precursors. Collectively, our results highlight that changes in the tissue microenvironment regulate multiple steps in adaptive reprogramming of NEPs upon death of cerebellar granule cell progenitors at birth, highlighting the instructive roles of microenvironmental signals during regeneration of the neonatal brain."
Ecology,Switch in parasitic and autotrophic-dominated protist assemblages coupled to seasonal oligotrophic-mesotrophic gradients in the sunlit layer of a subtropical marine ecosystem,"Yoav,Raffaele,Maxim,Gil,Nicolas,Colomban,Miguel,Yoav,Raffaele,Maxim,Gil,Nicolas,Colomban,Miguel,Yoav,Raffaele,Maxim,Gil,Nicolas,Colomban","Protists are major functional players in the oceans. Time-resolved epipelagic protist successions remain poorly described in subtropical ecosystems, limiting current understanding of food web dynamics and responses to environmental changes in these major world-ocean regions. Here, we used amplicon sequencing data and their trait-based annotation to examine the seasonality of planktonic protists in the subtropical Gulf of Aqaba (northern Red Sea). Temperature and nutrients were identified as major drivers of succession. Marked seasonal shifts in protists were detected. The warm, stratified oligotrophic period spanning through spring and summer were dominated by heterotrophs, including parasitic Syndiniales. By contrast, nutrient influx during deep convective-mixing in winter triggered a progressive shift to photoautotrophic communities dominated by few chlorophyte genera. Ephemeral phytoplankton blooms were detected during the mixing-to-stratification transition. Deeper winter mixing resulted in larger blooms dominated by diatoms and coccolithophores relative to chlorophytes prevalent during shallower mixing. This illustrates the impact of mixing-depth in the development and compostion of blooms. Comparisons with oceanwide rDNA datasets indicate that the oligotrophic protist assemblages from the Gulf of Aqaba resemble those from warm, open-oceans. This work provides a detailed assessment of the seasonality in protist communities and dominant functional strategies in a coastal subtropical planktonic ecosystem."

In U/V systems, sex determination occurs in the haploid phase, with U chromosomes in females and V chromosomes in males. Here, we explore several male, female and partially sex-reversed male lines of giant kelp to decipher how U/V sex chromosomes and autosomes initiate male versus female development. We identify a key set of genes on the sex chromosomes involved in triggering sexual development, and characterise autosomal effector genes underlying sexual differentiation. We show that male, but not female, development involves large-scale transcriptome reorganisation with pervasive enrichment in regulatory genes, faster evolutionary rates, and high species specificity of male-biased genes. Our observations imply that a female-like phenotype is the ground state, which is complemented by the presence of a U-chromosome, but overridden by a dominant male developmental program in the presence of a V-chromosome."
Genomics,Micro-RNA 7975 directly regulates MDTH expression and mediates endothelial cell proliferation and migration in the development of early atherosclerosis,"Genesio,Nathan,Genesio,Nathan,Genesio","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is commonly due to the development of atherosclerosis. Endothelial integrity is critical in the prevention of pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The key to prevention of CVD is understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for initiation of early atherosclerosis. MiRNAs are mediators of endothelial homeostasis, and their dysregulation could lead to early atherosclerotic disorder. We previously revealed the expression of miR-7975 in early atherosclerotic lesions. The aim of this study was to investigate the novel roles of miR-7975 on endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and in the regulation of metadherin (MTDH) expression. We performed proliferation and migration assays coupled with luciferase assay. We show that miR-7975 promotes proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and that miR-7976 directly regulates (MTDH), previously associated with cancer pathogenesis. In conclusion our results show miR-7975 could be a potential mediator of endothelial homeostasis and that MTDH is a novel target of miR-7975."

Here, we introduce EuPRI (Eukaryotic Protein-RNA Interactions) — a freely available resource of RNA motifs for 34,736 RBPs from 690 eukaryotes. EuPRI includes , binding data for 504 RBPs, including newly collected RNAcompete data for 174 RBPs, along with thousands of reconstructed motifs. We reconstruct these motifs with a new computational platform — Joint Protein-Ligand Embedding (JPLE) — which can detect distant homology relationships and map specificity-determining peptides. EuPRI quadruples the number of known RBP motifs, expanding the motif repertoire across all major eukaryotic clades, and assigning motifs to the majority of human RBPs. EuPRI drastically improves knowledge of RBP motifs in flowering plants. For example, it increases the number of , RBP motifs 7-fold, from 14 to 105. EuPRI also has broad utility for inferring post-transcriptional function and evolutionary relationships. We demonstrate this by predicting a role for 12 , RBPs in RNA stability and identifying rapid and recent evolution of post-transcriptional regulatory networks in worms and plants. In contrast, the vertebrate RNA motif set has remained relatively stable after its drastic expansion between the metazoan and vertebrate ancestors. EuPRI represents a powerful resource for the study of gene regulation across eukaryotes."

The Mar Menor costal lagoon (South-East of Spain) has experienced episodes of eutrophication due to intensive agriculture and other human activities, causing mass mortalities of marine fauna. In this scenario, biodiversity monitoring is crucial to evaluate the status of fauna and flora and take appropriate measures. Here, our main objective was to assess faunal composition and its spatial and temporal structure associated with the pillars used to support the built recreational well-being facilities along the Mar Menor. We capitalised on the many sea sponges that settle on these structures by collecting tissue samples for subsequent extraction of filtered environmental DNA (i.e.  natural sampler DNA, nsDNA) in northern and southern areas of the lagoon, both in spring and summer. We metabarcoded all samples at the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (COI), and reliably identified 76 taxa belonging to nine different phyla, with annelids, poriferans, molluscs and cnidarians being the richest groups. We detected emblematic species of threatened status, such as pipefishes (genus Syngnathus) and the piddock clam, Pholas dactylus, and others known to become invasive, such as the ascidians Styela canopus and Botrylloides niger, the barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite, and the polychaetes Branchiomma bairdi and Branchiomma boholense. The use of common and widely distributed sponges as natural eDNA samplers allowed us to characterise both spatial and temporal diversity, further emphasizing the importance of this low-cost approach to monitoring biological communities in shallow coastal ecosystems."
Developmental Biology,The NHR-23-regulated putative protease inhibitor mlt-11 gene is necessary for C. elegans cuticle structure and function,"Jmaes Matthew,Ariela,Anton,An A.,Vivian T.,Jordan D.,Jmaes Matthew,Ariela,Anton,An A.,Vivian T.,Jordan D.,Jmaes Matthew,Ariela,Anton,An A.,Vivian T.","C. elegans molting offers a powerful entry point to understanding developmentally programmed apical extracellular matrix remodeling. However, the gene regulatory network controlling this process remains poorly understood. Focusing on targets of NHR-23, a key transcription factor that drives molting, we confirmed the Kunitz family protease inhibitor gene mlt-11 as an NHR-23 target. Through reporter assays, we identified NHR-23-binding sites that are necessary and sufficient for epithelial expression. We generated a translational fusion and demonstrated that MLT-11 is localized to the cuticle and lined openings to the exterior (vulva, rectum, mouth). We created a set of strains expressing varied levels of MLT-11 by deleting endogenous cis-regulatory element sequences. Combined deletion of two cis-regulatory elements caused developmental delay, motility defects, and failure of the cuticle barrier. Inactivation of mlt-11 by RNAi produced even more pronounced defects. mlt-11 is necessary to pattern every layer of the adult cuticle, suggesting a broad patterning role prior to the formation of the mature cuticle. Together these studies provide an entry point into understanding how individual cis-regulatory elements function to coordinate expression of oscillating genes involved in molting and how MLT-11 ensures proper cuticle assembly."

Genomics,Investigating the Diuraphis noxia-Triticum aestivum interaction using transcriptomics,"Hendrik W.,Christine H.,Anna-Maria,Hendrik W.,Christine H.,Anna-Maria,Hendrik W.,Christine H.","Aphids often overcome host plant resistance by developing virulence. However, the underlying mechanisms and the precise modifications involved remain poorly understood. Additionally, the molecular response of resistant host plants during compatible (virulent aphid) and incompatible (avirulent aphid) interactions is another area requiring further investigation.
Here, Diuraphis noxia (Russian wheat aphid) biotypes of varying virulence were transferred from susceptible Triticum aestivum to a near-isogenic line containing the Dn7 resistance gene. Transcriptomes of the D. noxia biotypes and the resistant host were sequenced before and after the host shift. 
Transcriptomic analysis indicated that the D. noxia biotypes had unique responses which were involved in detoxification (e.g. L-xylulose reductase), membrane transport (e.g. Tert-1) and epigenetic regulation. In addition, many transposable elements were rapidly differentially regulated between biotypes and because of the host shift. In the host plant, all biotypes induced jasmonic acid signalling and terpenoid biosynthesis. However, the mono- and diterpenoid pathways were only upregulated following feeding by the biotypes avirulent to Dn7 and not SAMv2. 
Rapid differential expression of transposons suggests a mechanism of adaptation for clonally reproducing aphids. Furthermore, SAMv2 may possess mechanisms to modulate the defence response of Dn7-containing T. aestivum."
Developmental Biology,Suppressing PDGFRβ Signaling Enhances Myocyte Fusion to Promote Skeletal Muscle Regeneration,"Siwen,Abigail M,Jaime E,Nikolai J,Benjamin D,Anna,Daniel C,Siwen,Abigail M,Jaime E,Nikolai J,Benjamin D,Anna,Daniel C,Siwen,Abigail M,Jaime E,Nikolai J,Benjamin D,Anna","Muscle cell fusion is critical for forming and maintaining multinucleated myotubes during skeletal muscle development and regeneration. However, the molecular mechanisms directing cell-cell fusion are not fully understood. Here, we identify platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ) signaling as a key modulator of myocyte fusion in adult muscle cells. Our findings demonstrate that genetic deletion of Pdgfrβ enhances muscle regeneration and increases myofiber size, whereas PDGFRβ activation impairs muscle repair. Inhibition of PDGFRβ activity promotes myonuclear accretion in both mouse and human myotubes, whereas PDGFRβ activation stalls myotube development by preventing cell spreading to limit fusion potential. Transcriptomics analysis show that PDGFRβ signaling cooperates with TGFβ signaling to direct myocyte size and fusion. Mechanistically, PDGFRβ signaling requires STAT1 activation, and blocking STAT1 phosphorylation enhances myofiber repair and size during regeneration. Collectively, PDGFRβ signaling acts as a regenerative checkpoint and represents a potential clinical target to rapidly boost skeletal muscle repair."
Cell Biology,"Post-transcriptional regulation of cyclin A and cyclin B mRNAs is mediated by Bruno 1 and Cup, and further fine-tuned within P-bodies","Livia V,Samantha N,Harpreet,Diana P,Livia V,Samantha N,Harpreet,Diana P,Livia V,Samantha N,Harpreet","Cell cycle progression is tightly controlled by the regulated synthesis and degradation of Cyclins, such as Cyclin A and Cyclin B, which activate CDK1 to trigger mitosis. Mutations affecting Cyclin regulation are often linked to tumorigenesis, making the study of cyclin mRNA regulation critical for identifying new cancer therapies. In this study, we demonstrate via super-resolution microscopy that cyclin A and cyclin B mRNAs associate with Bruno 1 and Cup in nurse cells. Depletion of either protein leads to abnormal Cyclin A and Cyclin B protein expression and a reduction in mRNA levels for both Cyclins. We further reveal that both cyclin A and cyclin B mRNAs accumulate in P-bodies marked by Me31B. Interestingly, Me31B is not involved in regulating cyclin A mRNA, as no changes in cyclin A mRNA levels or repression were observed upon Me31B depletion. However, cyclin B mRNA shows stage-specific derepression and reduced levels when Me31B is absent. Notably, the association between cyclin B and Cup is strengthened in the absence of Me31B, indicating that this interaction occurs independently of P-bodies. These results highlight the nuanced, mRNA-specific roles of P-body condensates in post-transcriptional regulation, challenging the idea of a uniform, binary mechanism of mRNA repression in P-bodies."
Biochemistry,Effects of METTL3-METTL14 on primary microRNA processing by Drosha-DGCR8,"Brijesh B,Yunsun,Brijesh B,Yunsun,Brijesh B","MicroRNAs modulate most protein-coding genes, and many are regulated during maturation. Chemical modifications of primary transcripts containing microRNAs have been implicated in altering Microprocessor processing efficiency, a key initiating endonucleolytic step performed by Drosha and DGCR8. METTL3-METTL14 produces N6-methyladenosine which is the most common methylation for mRNAs. Genetic experiments suggested that METTL3-METTL14 promotes primary microRNA processing by Microprocessor, but the molecular mechanism still needs to be elucidated. We tested the hypothesis that METTL3-METTL14 or m6A may directly impact Drosha or DGCR8 function during primary microRNA processing. After reconstituting the methyltransferase and processing activities, we show that the presence of METTL3-METTL14 complexes does not affect the processing efficiency of Drosha-DGCR8. We also established a method to prepare m6A-modified primary microRNAs and used them to show that the processing of the transcripts with m6A is similar to those without any modification. Recombinant METTL3-METTL14 and DGCR8 do not form stable complexes, challenging the previous model that depends on enhanced DGCR8 recruitment. Therefore, METTL3-METTL14 or m6A modification does not generally promote Microprocessor-mediated microRNA processing, although they may impact certain cases."

To generate a circadian mouse liver isoform-level transcriptome, we processed these reads using the Mandalorion tool which identified and quantified 58,612 isoforms, 1806 of which showed circadian oscillations. We performed detailed analysis on the circadian oscillation of these isoforms, their coding sequences, and transcription start sites and compiled easy-to-access resources for other researchers.

However, current hydrophilic polymer coatings and films have significant drawbacks, including swelling and delamination. To address these issues, we modified hydroxyethyl cellulose with thioether groups to generate an oxidation-responsive polymer, HECMTP. HECMTP readily dissolves in green solvents and can be fabricated as coatings or films with tunable thicknesses. HECMTP coatings effectively scavenge hydrogen peroxide, resulting in conversion of thioether groups to sulfoxide groups on the polymer chain. Oxidation-driven, hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic transitions that are isolated to the surface of HECMTP coatings under physiologically relevant conditions increase wettability, decrease stiffness, and reduce protein adsorption to generate a non-fouling interface with minimal coating delamination or swelling. HECMTP can be used in diverse optical applications and permits oxidation-responsive, controlled drug release. HECMTP films are non-resorbable in vivo and evoke minimal foreign body responses. These results highlight the versatility of HECMTP and support its incorporation into chronically implanted medical devices."

Brock,Fang,Richard,Connor G.,Md Jashim","siRNA therapeutics have considerable potential as molecularly-targeted therapeutics in malignant disease, but identification of effective delivery strategies that mediate rapid intracellular delivery while minimizing toxicity has been challenging. Our group recently developed and optimized an siRNA conjugate platform termed siRNA-L2, which harnesses non-covalent association with endogenous circulating albumin to extend circulation half-life and achieve tumor-selective delivery without the use of traditional cationic lipids or polymers for transfection. To improve intracellular delivery and particularly the endosomal escape properties of siRNA-L2 towards more efficient gene silencing, we report synthesis of siRNA-CQ-L2 conjugates, in which chloroquine (CQ), an endosomolytic quinoline alkaloid, is covalently incorporated into the branching lipid tail structure. We accomplished this via synthesis of a novel CQ phosphoramidite, which can be incorporated into a modular siRNA-L2 backbone using on-column solid-phase synthesis through use of asymmetric branchers with levulinyl-protected hydroxide groups that allow covalent addition of pendant CQ repeats. We demonstrate that siRNA-CQ-L2 maintains the ability to non-covalently bind albumin, and with multiple copies of CQ, siRNA-CQ-L2 mediates higher endosomal disruption, cellular uptake/retention, and reporter gene knockdown in cancer cells. Further, in mice, the addition of CQ did not significantly affect circulation kinetics nor organ biodistribution and did not produce hematologic or organ-level toxicity. Thus, controlled, multivalent conjugation of albumin-binding siRNA-L2 to endosomolytic small molecule compounds holds promise in improving siRNA-L2 knockdown potency while maintaining albumin-binding properties and overall safety."

Here, we quantify the relative contribution of hepatic oxidative pathways to liver injury in MASLD-MASH. Using NMR spectroscopy, UHPLC-MS, and GC-MS, we performed stable-isotope tracing and formal flux modeling to quantify hepatic oxidative fluxes in humans across the spectrum of MASLD-MASH, and in mouse models of impaired ketogenesis. We found in humans with MASH, that liver injury correlated positively with ketogenesis and total fat oxidation, but not with turnover of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The use of loss-of-function mouse models demonstrated that disruption of mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS2), the rate-limiting step of ketogenesis, impairs overall hepatic fat oxidation and induces a MASLD-MASH-like phenotype. Furthermore, disruption of mitochondrial β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BDH1), the terminal step of ketogenesis, also impaired fat oxidation, but surprisingly did not exacerbate steatotic liver injury. Taken together, these findings suggest that quantifiable variations in overall hepatic fat oxidation may not be a primary determinant of MASLD-to-MASH progression, but rather, that maintenance of hepatic ketogenesis could serve a protective role through alternative fat oxidation-independent mechanisms."
Bioengineering,End-to-end multimodal deep learning for real-time decoding of months-long neural activity from the same cells,"Yichun,Arnau,Hao,Ren,Jia,Yichun,Arnau,Hao,Ren,Jia,Yichun,Arnau,Hao,Ren","Long-term, stable, and real-time decoding of behavior-dependent neural dynamics from the same cells is critical for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and for understanding neural evolution during learning, and memory, and disease progression. Recent advances in flexible and high-density electrodes have enabled the stability required for long-term tracking but generate vast datasets that challenge existing analysis methods. Current spike sorting approaches rely heavily on manual curation and lack scalability for large-scale, real-time processing. Here, we introduce AutoSort, an end-to-end multimodal deep neural network-based method that enables real-time tracking and decoding of the same neurons over months. AutoSort uses a scalable strategy by learning deep representations from initial recordings and applying the trained model in real-time. It integrates multimodal features, including waveform features, distribution patterns, and inferred neuron spatial locations, to ensure robustness and accuracy. AutoSort outperforms existing methods in both simulated and long-term recordings, reducing computational demands by using only 10% of the time and 25% of the memory compared to conventional methods. By combining AutoSort with high-density flexible probes, we track neural dynamics in real-time during motor learning and skill acquisition over 2 months, capturing intrinsic neural manifold drift, stabilization, and post-learning representational drift. AutoSort offers a promising solution for studying long-term neural intrinsic dynamics and enabling real-time BCI decoding."

The biochemical signalling underlying cell density- dependent cues regulating Hippo signalling and its downstream effectors, YAP, remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal that the tight junction protein ZO-2 is required for the contact-mediated inhibition of proliferation. We additionally determined that the well-established molecular players of contact inhibition of proliferation, namely Hippo kinase LATS1 and YAP, are regulated by ZO-2, and that the scaffolding function of ZO-2 promotes the interaction with and phosphorylation of YAP by LATS1. Mechanistically, YAP is phosphorylated when ZO-2 brings LATS1 and YAP together via its SH3 and PDZ domains, respectively, subsequently leading to the cytoplasmic retention and inactivation of YAP.

In S. cerevisiae, the glycan of these proteins is trimmed by the luminal mannosidase Mnl1 (Htm1) to generate a signal that triggers degradation. Curiously, Mnl1 is permanently associated with protein disulfide isomerase (Pdi1). Here, we have used cryo-electron microscopy, biochemical, and in vivo experiments to clarify how this complex initiates ERAD. The Mnl1-Pdi1 complex first de-mannosylates misfolded, globular proteins that are recognized through a C-terminal domain (CTD) of Mnl1; Pdi1 causes the CTD to ignore completely unfolded polypeptides. The disulfides of these globular proteins are then reduced by the Pdi1 component of the complex, generating unfolded polypeptides that can be translocated across the membrane. Mnl1 blocks the canonical oxidative function of Pdi1, but allows it to function as the elusive disulfide reductase in ERAD."
Bioinformatics,Subtractive proteomics unravel the potency of D-Alanine-D-Alanine Ligase as the drug target for Burkholderia pseudomallei,"Shakilur,Ayush,Prerona,Manisha,Amit Kumar,Ditipriya,Amlan,Shakilur,Ayush,Prerona,Manisha,Amit Kumar,Ditipriya,Amlan,Shakilur,Ayush,Prerona,Manisha,Amit Kumar,Ditipriya","Melioidosis, also known as Whitmore's disease, is caused by the deadly pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei and remains a significant global health concern, particularly in South Asia. The disease is contracted through exposure to contaminated soil, water, air, and food. Infected individuals often present with abscesses in internal organs such as the lungs, spleen, and liver, and in soft tissues, with severe cases leading to septic shock and acute pneumonia. The rising incidence and mortality rates, coupled with B. pseudomallei's ability to form biofilms and develop resistance to antibiotics like cephalosporins, make treatment increasingly challenging. This highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches.D-Alanine-D-Alanine ligase (Ddl), a crucial enzyme involved in the final stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis, which protects the pathogen from the hostile cellular environment of the host. While many bacteria have two isoforms of this enzyme, B. pseudomallei possesses only the DdlB isoform, presenting a significant vulnerability. Our study represents the first successful attempt to target DdlB through a combination of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. These investigations provide strong evidence that Conivaptan acts as an effective inhibitor of DdlB, offering a novel therapeutic approach for combating melioidosis."

Herein, we present an array of five anionic cyanine-based turn-on plasma membrane probes with emission spanning from green to near infrared. They are analogous of commonly used MemBright probes family, where two zwitterionic anchor groups are replaced with anionic sulfonates with dodecyl chains. The developed probes provide selective wash-free staining of plasma membranes of live cells in vitro, featuring improved brightness and slower internalization inside the cells. In comparison to protein-based (wheat germ agglutinin) membrane markers, new membrane probes provide better staining in poorly assessable cell-cell contacts. A key challenge is to stain cell plasma membranes directly in vivo. During in vivo brain tissue imaging in living mice by two-photon microscopy, the anionic cyanine probes allowed us to visualize in detail the pyramidal neurons with high image quality, clearly resolving neuron soma, dendrites with dendritic spines and axons with axonal boutons. The developed anionic cyanine-based plasma membrane probes constitute an important extension of the toolbox of fluorescent probes for plasma membrane research."

These stresses are typically observed through opening angle of a radially cut artery segment, often regarded as a primary descriptor of their stress-free state. However, the experimental evidence regarding the stress-free states of different artery layers is scarce. In this study, two experimental protocols, each employing different layer-separating sequences, were performed on 17 human common carotid arteries; the differences between both protocols were found statistically insignificant. While the media exhibited opening behaviour (reduced curvature), a contrasting trend was observed for the adventitia curvature, indicating its closing behaviour. In addition to the different bending effect, length changes of both layers after separation were observed, namely shortening of the adventitia and elongation of the media. The results point out that not all the residual stresses are released after a radial cut but a significant portion of them is released only after the layer separation. Considering the different mechanical properties of layers, this may significantly change the stress distribution in arterial wall and should be considered in its biomechanical models."

Introducing giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as MSI ground truth for cell-sized objects and Monte Carlo reference-based consensus clustering for data-dependent identification of cell subpopulations. The PRISM-MS (PRescan Imaging for Small Molecule - Mass Spectrometry) dual-scan MSI workflow is presented, enabling space-efficient and therefore faster lipid analysis in single GUVs and cells. Beyond lipids, PRISM-MS enables MSI and on-cell MS2-based identification of low-mass metabolites like amino acids or Krebs cycle intermediates involved in stimulus-dependent cell activation. The utility of PRISM-MS is demonstrated through the characterization of complex metabolome changes in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial cells and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia. Translation of single cell results to endogenous microglia in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures indicates that LPS-activation involves changes of the itaconate-to-taurine ratio and alterations in neuron-to-glia glutamine-glutamate shuttling. The data suggests that PRISM-MS could serve as a standard method in single cell metabolomics, given its capability to characterize larger cell populations and low-mass metabolites."
Biochemistry,Two conserved arginine residues facilitate C-S bond cleavage and persulfide transfer in Suf family cysteine desulfurases.,"Rajleen K.,Juliana V.,Jack A.,Patrick A.,Rajleen K.,Juliana V.,Jack A.,Patrick A.,Rajleen K.,Juliana V.,Jack A.","Under conditions of oxidative stress or iron starvation, iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis in , is initiated by the cysteine desulfurase, SufS, via the SUF pathway. SufS is a type II cysteine desulfurase that catalyzes the PLP-dependent breakage of an L-cysteine C-S bond to generate L-alanine and a covalent active site persulfide as products. The persulfide is transferred from SufS to SufE and then to the SufBC2D complex, which utilizes it in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis. Several lines of evidence suggest two conserved arginine residues that line the solvent side of the SufS active site could be important for function. To investigate the mechanistic roles of R56 and R359, the residues were substituted using site-directed mutagenesis to obtain R56A/K and R359A/K SufS variants. Steady state kinetics indicated R56 and R359 have moderate defects in the desulfurase half reaction but major defects in the transpersulfurase step. Fluorescence polarization binding assays showed that the loss of activity was not due to a defect in forming the SufS/SufE complex. Structural characterization of R56A SufS shows loss of electron density for the α3-α4 loop at the R56/G57 positions, consistent with a requirement of R56 for proper loop conformation. The structure of R359A SufS exhibits a conformational change in the α3-α4 loop allowing R56 to enter the active site and mimics the residue's position in the PLP-cysteine aldimine structure. Taken together, the kinetic, binding, and structural data support a mechanism where R359 plays a role in linking SufS catalysis with modulation of the α3-α4 loop to promote a close-approach interaction of SufS and SufE conducive to persulfide transfer."
Bioengineering,Model-Based Estimation of Active and Passive Muscle Forces Using MRE in Forearm Muscles During 2-DOF Wrist Tasks,"Cody A,Fabrizio,Cody A,Fabrizio,Cody A","Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)-based muscle force estimation methods have been proposed to estimate individual muscle forces based on measurements of shear wave speed and joint torque in multiple postures. To estimate both the slope and offset parameters of the relationship between shear wave speed and muscle force, it is necessary to collect measurements in a plethora of postures in case of substantial muscle redundancy. However, anisotropic MRE requires a structural and diffusion-tensor imaging scan in each posture, which is infeasible given the time constraints of MRI imaging. The objectives of this work were to develop a muscle force estimator with sufficient accuracy that would only require a limited set of postures, and to evaluate its effectiveness under a variety of measurement conditions. We developed a novel MRE-based muscle force estimator, which decouples shear wave speed into its active and passive components and solves for the slope and offset parameters, independently. We assessed the effectiveness of the proposed estimator under different simulated measurement conditions, with varying levels of noise, and compared it to the original MRE-based estimator. The proposed estimator results in a reduction in the estimation error for the offset parameter, for all muscles, without significant degradation in the estimation error for the slope parameter. However, the proposed muscle force estimator does not improve the goodness-of-fit or the cross-validation error compared to the original estimator. In conclusion, the proposed MRE-based muscle force estimator improves the estimation of muscle-specific parameters and may yield increased muscle force estimation performance."

Here we show that MLL and its associated protein WDR5, localize to the midbody. Loss of MLL/WDR5 results in defective midbody formation, which displays a wide midzone-like microtubule structure, along with chromosome bridges, resulting in binucleated cells. We show that MLL and WDR5 interact with kinesin 13 motor, KIF2C, and targets it to the midbody. The depolymerase activity of KIF2C promotes correct localization of centralspindlin complex, compaction of midzone MTs and finally furrow completion. By characterizing the previously undiscovered role of MLL and KIF2C in the regulation of cytokinesis, our work underscores the importance of these proteins at the interface of actin and microtubule cytoskeleton regulation, pathways that are frequently altered in oncogenesis."

Bioinformatics,Improving inference in wastewater-based epidemiology by modelling the statistical features of digital PCR,"Adrian,Timothy,Tanja,Adrian,Timothy,Tanja,Adrian,Timothy","The growing field of wastewater-based infectious disease surveillance relies on the quantification of pathogen concentrations in wastewater using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. However, existing models for monitoring pathogen spread using wastewater have often been adapted from methods for case count data and neglect the statistical features of PCR techniques. In this paper, we seek to overcome the widespread simplistic modelling of wastewater PCR measurements as normally or log-normally distributed by proposing an appropriate model for digital PCR (dPCR). Building on established statistical theory of dPCR, we derive approximations for the coefficient of variation of measurements and the probability of non-detection and propose a hurdle model-based likelihood for estimating concentrations from dPCR measurements. Using simulations and real-world data, we show that simple likelihoods based on normal or log-normal distributions are misspecified, affecting the estimation of pathogen concentrations and infection trends over time. In contrast, the proposed dPCR-specific likelihood accurately models the distribution of dPCR measurements, improving epidemiological estimates and forecasts even if details of the laboratory protocol are unknown. The method has been implemented in the open-source R package EpiSewer to improve wastewater-based monitoring of pathogens."

Here we introduce CellWhisperer, a multimodal machine learning model and software that connects transcriptomes and text for interactive single-cell RNA-seq data analysis. CellWhisperer enables the chat-based interrogation of transcriptome data in English language. To train our model, we created an AI-curated dataset with over a million pairs of RNA-seq profiles and matched textual annotations across a broad range of human biology, and we established a multimodal embedding of matched transcriptomes and text using contrastive learning. Our model enables free-text search and annotation of transcriptome datasets by cell types, states, and other properties in a zero-shot manner and without the need for reference datasets. Moreover, CellWhisperer answers questions about cells and genes in natural-language chats, using a biologically fluent large language model that we fine-tuned to analyze bulk and single-cell transcriptome data across various biological applications. We integrated CellWhisperer with the widely used CELLxGENE browser, allowing users to interactively explore RNA-seq data through an integrated graphical and chat interface.

Bioinformatics,Replacing Normalizations with Interval Assumptions Improves the Rigor and Robustness of Differential Expression and Differential Abundance Analyses,"Kyle C,Justin D,Kyle C,Justin D,Kyle C","Standard methods for differential expression and differential abundance analysis rely on normalization to address sample-to-sample variation in sequencing depth. However, normalizations imply strict, unrealistic assumptions about the unmeasured scale of biological systems (e.g., microbial load or total cellular transcription). This introduces bias that can lead to false positives and false negatives. To overcome these limitations, we suggest replacing normalizations with interval assumptions. This approach allows researchers to explicitly define plausible lower and upper bounds on the unmeasured biological system's scale, making these assumptions more realistic, transparent, and flexible than those imposed by traditional normalizations. Compared to recent alternatives like scale models and sensitivity analyses, interval assumptions are easier to use, resulting in potentially reduced false positives and false negatives, and have stronger guarantees of Type-I error control. We make interval assumptions accessible by introducing a modified version of ALDEx2 as a publicly available software package. Through simulations and real data studies, we show these methods can reduce false positives and false negatives compared to normalization-based tools."
Bioinformatics,Pipeline to explore information on genome editing using large language models and genome editing meta-database,"Takayuki,Hidemasa,Takayuki,Hidemasa,Takayuki","Genome editing (GE) is widely recognized as an effective and valuable technology in life sciences research. However, certain genes are difficult to edit depending on some factors such as the type of species, sequences, and GE tools. Therefore, confirming the presence or absence of GE practices in previous publications is crucial for the effectively design and establishment of research using GE. Although the Genome Editing Meta-database (GEM: https://bonohu.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/gem/) aims to provide as comprehensive GE information as possible, it does not indicate how each registered gene is involved in GE. In this study, we developed a systematic method for extracting essential GE information using large language models from the information based on GEM and GE-related articles. This approach allows for a systematic and efficient investigation of GE information that cannot be achieved using the current GEM alone. In addition, by converting the extracted GE information into metrics, we propose a potential application of this method to prioritize genes for future research. The extracted GE information and novel GE-related scores are expected to facilitate the efficient selection of target genes for GE and support the design of research using GE."

The transcriptome of megakaryocytes has been studied, while the platelet transcriptome is thought to be a reflection of their parent cells; it has not yet been investigated. Although platelets lack nuclei, they inherit RNA from their parent megakaryocytes, while only about 10% of them are believed to contain enough RNA for meaningful analysis. This study explores the potential of single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the platelet transcriptome, aiming to expand our understanding of platelets beyond their traditional role in coagulation. Using acridine orange staining and antibody-based sequencing, we successfully sequenced RNA from seven healthy donors. Results revealed significant heterogeneity in gene expression, with common platelet markers, such as ITGA2B and GP1B, being less abundant than expected. Interestingly, immune markers associated with lung megakaryocytes were not strongly represented in peripheral platelets. Comparison with current algorithms for cell identification suggests that platelets are often misclassified as other blood cell types, highlighting limitations of existing pipelines in platelet annotation. This misclassification may have led to misrepresentation of platelet transcriptomics in previous studies. These findings underscore the need for tailored sequencing methods to accurately profile platelets and set the foundation for further exploration of platelet biology and immune function, potentially opening avenues for therapeutic interventions in immune modulation, drug delivery, and the use of platelets as disease biomarkers in cancer and other conditions.  "

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the SSRI citalopram combined with part-time patching of the fellow fixing eye would improve amblyopic eye visual acuity in adult humans. Following a cross-over, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled design (pre-registration: ACTRN12611000669998), participants completed two 2-week blocks of fellow fixing eye patching. One block combined patching with citalopram (20 mg/day) and the other with a placebo tablet. The blocks were separated by a 2-week washout period. The primary outcome was change in amblyopic eye visual acuity. Secondary outcomes included stereoacuity and electrophysiological measures of retinal and cortical function. Seven participants were randomized, fewer than our pre-specified sample size of 20. There were no statistically significant differences in amblyopic eye visual acuity change between the active (mean ± SD change = 0.08±0.16 logMAR) and the placebo (mean change = −0.01±0.03 logMAR) blocks. No treatment effects were observed for any secondary outcomes. However, 3 of 7 participants experienced a 0.1 logMAR or greater improvement in amblyopic eye visual acuity in the active but not the placebo block. These results from a small sample suggest that larger-scale trials of SSRI treatment for adult amblyopia may be warranted. Considerations for future trials include drug dose, treatment duration and recruitment challenges."

The training paradigm used images from a morph sequence that mixed a happy expression with a mixed-emotion ‘norm’ expression to create a sequence of varying intensity happy expressions. Participants were asked to say whether or not individual faces from the sequence were happy, to measure their happiness detection threshold. Participants that received active training were given biased feedback to shift their detection threshold, while participants that received control training were given feedback consistent with their baseline threshold. There was some statistical evidence that thresholds in the active training group shifted more than in the control group. This suggests training was successful in increasing the number of expressions that individuals identified as happy. However, there was no evidence that training increased facial expression recognition accuracy, as measured by the Reading the Mind in the Eyes task completed after training (Study 2)."
Bioinformatics,Knowledge Graphs and Explainable AI for Drug Repurposing on Rare Diseases,"Pablo,Katy,Marco,Nuria,Pablo,Katy,Marco,Nuria,Pablo,Katy,Marco","Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based drug repurposing is an emerging strategy to identify drug candidates
to treat rare diseases. However, cutting-edge algorithms based on Deep Learning (DL) typically dont provide a human understandable explanation supporting their predictions. This is a problem because it hampers the biologists ability to decide which predictions are the most plausible drug candidates to test in costly lab experiments. In this study, we propose rd-explainer a novel AI drug repurposing method for rare diseases which obtains possible drug candidates together with human understandable explanations. The method is based on Graph Neural Network (GNN) technology and explanations were generated as semantic graphs using state-of-the-art eXplainable AI (XAI). The model learns features from current background knowledge on the target rare disease structured as a Knowledge Graph (KG), which integrates curated facts and their evidence on different biomedical entities such as symptoms, drugs, genes and ortholog genes. Our experiments demonstrate that our method has excellent performance that is superior to state-of the-art models. We investigated the application of XAI on drug repurposing for rare diseases and we prove our method is capable of discovering plausible drug candidates based on testable explanations. The data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/PPerdomoQ/rare-disease-explainer."

Clinical Trials,Comparison of three different eye-tracking tasks for distinguishing autistic from typically developing children and autistic symptom severity,"Juan,Jiao,Meina,Chunmei,Zhuo,Qin,Weihua,Lei,Benjamin,Keith M,Juan,Jiao,Meina,Chunmei,Zhuo,Qin,Weihua,Lei,Benjamin,Keith M,Juan,Jiao,Meina,Chunmei,Zhuo,Qin,Weihua,Lei,Benjamin","Altered patterns of visual social attention preference detected using eye-tracking and a variety of different paradigms are increasingly proposed as sensitive biomarkers for autism spectrum disorder. However, few eye tracking studies have compared the relative efficacy of different paradigms to discriminate between autistic compared with typically developing children and their sensitivity to specific symptoms. To target this issue, the current study used three common eye tracking protocols contrasting social versus non-social stimuli in young (2-7 years old) Chinese autistic (n = 35) and typically developing (n = 34) children matched for age and gender. Protocols included dancing people ,. dynamic geometrical images, biological motion (dynamic light point walking human or cat) ,. non-biological motion (scrambled controls) and child playing with toy ,. toy alone. Although all three paradigms differentiated autistic and typically developing children, the dancing people versus dynamic geometry pattern paradigm was the most effective, with autistic children showing marked reductions in visual preference for dancing people and correspondingly increased one for geometric patterns. Furthermore, this altered visual preference in autistic children was correlated with the ADOS social affect score and had the highest discrimination accuracy. Our results therefore indicate that decreased visual preference for dynamic social stimuli may be the most effective visual attention-based paradigm for use as a biomarker for autism in Chinese children.

Clinical Trials,Few Effects of a 5-week Computerized Cognitive Training Program in Healthy Older Adults,"Sheida,Cassandra,Jessica,Marcelo,Murillo,Anita,Patrick S. R.,Sheida,Cassandra,Jessica,Marcelo,Murillo,Anita,Patrick S. R.,Sheida,Cassandra,Jessica,Marcelo,Murillo,Anita","Computerized cognitive training programs are becoming increasingly popular and practical for cognitive aging. Nevertheless, basic questions remain about the benefits of such programs, and about the degree to which participant expectations might influence training and transfer. Here we examined a commercial cognitive training program (,) in a 5-week double-blind, pseudo-randomized placebo-controlled trial. Based on a priori power analysis, we recruited 99 healthy older adults 59-91 years of age (M = 68.87, SD = 6.31; 69 women), assigning them to either the intervention or an active control program (Sudoku and n-back working memory exercises). We subdivided both groups into high and low expectation priming conditions, to probe for effects of participants’ expectations on training and transfer. We assessed transfer using a battery of standard neuropsychological and psychosocial measures that had been agreed to by the training program developers. We planned and pre-registered our analyses (on osf.io). The majority (88%) of participants progressed through the training, and most provided positive feedback about it. Similarly, the majority (80%) of participants believed they were truly training their brains. Yet, transfer of training was minimal. Also minimal were any effects of expectations on training and transfer, although participants who received high expectation priming tended to engage more with their assigned program overall. Our findings suggest limited benefits of , training on cognition and psychosocial wellbeing in healthy older adults, at least under the conditions we used."
Clinical Trials,Human extinction learning is accelerated by an angiotensin antagonist via ventromedial prefrontal cortex and its connections with basolateral amygdala,"Feng,Yayuan,Fei,Jialin,Pan,Congcong,Weihua,Tingyong,Adam J.,Richard P.,Keith M.,Benjamin,Feng,Yayuan,Fei,Jialin,Pan,Congcong,Weihua,Tingyong,Adam J.,Richard P.,Keith M.,Benjamin,Feng,Yayuan,Fei,Jialin,Pan,Congcong,Weihua,Tingyong,Adam J.,Richard P.,Keith M.","Extinction is considered a core mechanism underlying exposure-based therapy in anxiety-related disorders. However, marked impairments in threat extinction learning coupled with impaired neuroplasticity in patients strongly impede the efficacy of exposure-based interventions. Recent translational research suggests a role of the renin-angiotensin (RA) system in both these processes. However, the efficacy of pharmacological modulation of the RA system to enhance threat extinction in humans and the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. The present pre-registered, randomized placebo-controlled pharmacological neuroimaging trial demonstrates that pre-extinction administration of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan accelerated attenuation of the psychophysiological threat response during extinction. On the neural level the acceleration of extinction was accompanied by threat-signal specific enhanced ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation and its coupling with the basolateral amygdala. Multivoxel pattern analysis and voxel-wise mediation analysis further revealed that that losartan reduced the neural threat expression, particularly in the vmPFC, and confirmed that acceleration of extinction critically involved treatment-induced modulation of vmPFC activation. Overall the results provide the first evidence for a pivotal role of the RA system in extinction learning in humans and suggest that adjunct losartan administration can be leveraged to facilitate the efficacy of extinction-based therapies."
Bioinformatics,A Multi-Modal Genomic Knowledge Distillation Framework for Drug Response Prediction,"Shuang,Shuqing,Huan,Qiang,Zhixiang,Shuang,Shuqing,Huan,Qiang,Zhixiang,Shuang,Shuqing,Huan,Qiang","Precision oncology utilizes genomic data to tailor treatment to individuals. Cancer drug sensitivity studies can predict the response levels of different drugs for the same cultured cancer cell line, which is beneficial for personalized medicine. Recent studies have demonstrated that integrating multi-modal genomic data, e.g., gene expression, mutation, copy number alteration, methylation, can provide comprehensive knowledge and improve drug response prediction. Although multi-modal genomic profiles are generally available from public datasets, only gene expression data is commonly used in clinical settings. In this study, we propose a framework for privileged information knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from a multi-modal genomic teacher network, using only gene expression for inference. Specifically, we train a teacher network by feature re-weighting based on inter-modality dependencies and align the inter-sample correlations through our proposed relation-aware differentiation distillation. Experiments on the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) dataset demonstrate that our framework improves drug response prediction by about 6% compared to the baseline and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Transferable studies performed on missing GDSC data and clinical datasets further confirm the feasibility of our model for predicting drug responses using only gene expression data."
Bioinformatics,"Discovery of Natural MCL1 Inhibitors using Pharmacophore modelling, QSAR, Docking, ADMET, Molecular Dynamics, and DFT Analysis","Uddalak,Tathagata,Jitendra,Anitha,Uddalak,Tathagata,Jitendra,Anitha,Uddalak,Tathagata,Jitendra","Mcl-1, a Bcl-2 family protein, is a key regulator of apoptosis and is often overexpressed in cancers such as lung, breast, pancreatic, cervical, ovarian cancers, leukemia, and lymphoma. Its role in inhibiting apoptosis enables tumor cells to evade cell death and contributes to drug resistance. Targeting Mcl-1 is crucial in inducing apoptosis and overcoming resistance to therapies that target other anti-apoptotic proteins, making it a prominent target for anticancer drug development across multiple malignancies. So, our study aimed to discover potent antileukemic compounds targeting MCL1. We began by selecting a diverse set of molecules from the BindingDB database to construct a structure-based pharmacophore model, which was subsequently used to virtually screen a library of 407,270 compounds from the COCONUT database. Subsequently, we developed an e-pharmacophore model using the co-crystallized inhibitor AMG-176, for further screening. A QSAR model was then implemented to estimate the IC50 values of these compounds, filtering those with predicted IC50 values below the median. The top hits were subjected to molecular docking and MMGBSA binding energy calculations against MCL1, leading to the selection of two promising candidates for further ADMET analysis. To assess their electronic properties, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted, which included geometry optimization, frontier molecular orbital (FMO) analysis, HOMO-LUMO gaps, and global reactivity descriptors. These analyses confirmed favourable profiles and reactivity for the chosen compounds. In addition, predictions for physicochemical and ADMET properties aligned well with the expected bioactivity and safety profiles of the candidates. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations further validated their strong binding affinity and stability, positioning them as potential MCL1 inhibitors. Our comprehensive computational approach highlights these compounds as promising and safe antileukemic agents, with future in vivo and in vitro validation recommended for further confirmation."
Bioinformatics,KinPFN: Bayesian Approximation of RNA Folding Kinetics using Prior-Data Fitted Networks,"Dominik,Frederic,Joerg K.H.,Michael T.,Christoph,Frank,Dominik,Frederic,Joerg K.H.,Michael T.,Christoph,Frank,Dominik,Frederic,Joerg K.H.,Michael T.,Christoph","RNA is a dynamic biomolecule crucial for cellular regulation, with its function largely determined by its folding into complex structures, while misfolding can lead to multifaceted biological sequelae. During the folding process, RNA traverses through a series of intermediate structural states, with each transition occurring at variable rates that collectively influence the time required to reach the functional form. Understanding these folding kinetics is vital for predicting RNA behavior and optimizing applications in synthetic biology and drug discovery. While in silico kinetic RNA folding simulators are often computationally intensive and time-consuming, accurate approximations of the folding times can already be very informative to assess the efficiency of the folding process. In this work, we present KinPFN, a novel approach that leverages prior-data fitted networks to directly model the posterior predictive distribution of RNA folding times. By training on synthetic data representing arbitrary prior folding times, KinPFN efficiently approximates the cumulative distribution function of RNA folding times in a single forward pass, given only a few initial folding time examples. Our method offers a modular extension to existing RNA kinetics algorithms, promising significant computational speed-ups orders of magnitude faster, while achieving comparable results. We showcase the effectiveness of KinPFN through extensive evaluations and real-world case studies, demonstrating its potential for RNA folding kinetics analysis, its practical relevance, and generalization to other biological data."

Bioinformatics,REPORTH: Determining orthologous locations of repetitive sequences between genomes,"Prajwal Vishwanath,Bram,Frederic,Prajwal Vishwanath,Bram,Frederic,Prajwal Vishwanath,Bram","Repetitive sequences are a common feature of bacterial genomes. Some repetitive sequences such as REPINs are mobile within the genome but inherited only vertically from mother to daughter across bacterial genomes. Selfish elements in contrast are mobile within the genome but also travel horizontally from genome to genome. Yet, no matter the nature of the association between the repetitive elements and the host, it is difficult to study the evolutionary dynamics of repetitive sequences across genomes. If it is unclear whether two sequences in two different genomes are in orthologous positions, it is difficult to infer parameters like the replication rate, horizontal transfer rate and rate of loss. Here we present a tool to facilitate these analyses called REPORTH. REPORTH determines whether repetitive sequences in different but closely related bacterial genomes occur in orthologous genomic positions. Whether a position is orthologous or not depends on the orthology of flanking sequences. Flanking sequences are deemed orthologous if they are bidirectional best hits. All repetitive sequences that are found in orthologous positions across different genomes are grouped together. Analyses of these groups can be used to study the evolutionary dynamics of selfish repetitive elements such as insertion sequences, but also for mutualistic repetitive elements such as REPINs."
Bioinformatics,Automatic Detection and Extraction of Key Resources from Tables in Biomedical Papers,"Ibrahim Burak,Anita,Ibrahim Burak,Anita,Ibrahim Burak","Tables are useful information artifacts that allow easy detection of data ""missingness"" by humans and have been deployed by several publishers to improve the amount of information present for key resources and reagents such as antibodies, cell lines, and other tools that constitute the inputs to a study. The STAR*Methods tables, specifically, have increased the ""findability"" of these key resources, but they have not been commonly available outside of the Cell Press journal family. To improve the availability of these tables in the broader biomedical literature, we have attempted to automatically process BioRxiv preprints to create tables from text or to recognize tables already created by authors and structure them for later use by publishers and search systems, to improve ""findability"" of resources in a larger amount of the scientific literature. The extraction of key resource tables in PDF files by the best in class tools resulted in Grid Table Similarity (GriTS) score of 0.12, so we have created several multimodal pipelines employing machine learning approaches for key resource table page identification, Table Transformer models for table detection and table structure recognition and a new table-specific language model for row over-segmentation to improve the extraction of text in tables created by biomedical authors and published on BioRxiv to around GriTS score of 0.90 enabling the deployment of automated research resource extraction tools onto BioRxiv."

Accurate predictive modeling of mRNA properties can greatly enhance our understanding and manipulation of biological processes, leading to advancements in medical and biotechnological applications. Utilizing bio-language foundation models allows for leveraging large-scale pretrained knowledge, which can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of these predictions. However, mRNA specific foundation models are notably limited posing challenges for efficient predictive modeling in mRNA-focused tasks. In contrast, DNA and protein modalities have numerous general-purpose foundation models trained on billions of sequences. This paper explores the potential for adaptation of existing DNA and protein bio-language models for mRNA-focused tasks. Through experiments using various mRNA datasets curated from both public domain and internal proprietary database, we demonstrate that pre-trained DNA and protein models can be effectively transferred for mRNA-focused tasks using various adaptation techniques such as probing, full-rank, and low-rank finetuning. In addition, we identify key factors that influence successful adaptation, offering guidelines on when general-purpose DNA and protein models are likely to perform well for mRNA-focused tasks. We further assess the impact of model size on adaptation efficacy, finding that medium-scale models often outperform larger ones for cross-modal knowledge transfer. We conclude that by leveraging the interconnectedness of DNA, mRNA, and proteins, as outlined by the central dogma of molecular biology, the knowledge in foundation models can be effectively transferred across modalities, significantly enhancing the repertoire of computational tools available for mRNA analysis."

Here we introduce a novel DRS toolkit, DEMINERS, which integrates an RNA multiplexing experimental workflow, a machine-learning barcode classifier based on Random Forest and a novel basecaller built on an optimized convolutional neural network providing an additional species-specific training module. With the increased accuracy in barcode classification and basecalling, DEMINERS can demultiplex up to 24 samples and the required RNA input and running time are both substantially reduced. We demonstrated the applications of DEMINERS in clinical metagenomics, cancer transcriptomics and parallel comparison of transcriptomic features in different biological conditions, revealing altered airway microbial diversity in COVID-19 and a potential role of m6A in increasing transcriptomic diversity in glioma and the mature blood-stage of malaria parasites. Overall, DEMINERS is a simple, robust, high-throughput DRS method for accurately estimating transcript levels, poly(A) lengths, and mutation and RNA modification heterogeneity at single-read level, with minimal sequencing biases."
Cell Biology,"Expression study of Krabbe Disease GALC missense variants — Insights from quantification profiles of residual enzyme activity, secretion and psychosine levels","Hui,Ying-Wai,Zitao,Aimee R,Michael H,Chris W,Hui,Ying-Wai,Zitao,Aimee R,Michael H,Chris W,Hui,Ying-Wai,Zitao,Aimee R,Michael H","Krabbe disease (KD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by loss–of–function mutations in the GALC gene, which encodes for the enzyme galactosylceramidase (GALC). GALC is crucial for myelin metabolism. Functional deficiency of GALC leads to toxic accumulation of psychosine, dysfunction and death of oligodendrocytes, and eventual brain demyelination. To date, 46 clinically–relevant, pathogenic GALC missense mutations (MMs) have been identified in KD patients. These MMs are present in ~70% of KD cases reported over 8 published studies between 1996 – 2019. However, the mechanisms by which these MMs lead to GALC functional deficiency and their correlations with clinical phenotype remain poorly understood. 
To address this, we generated a GALC–knockout human oligodendrocytic cell line (MO3.13/ GALC–KO) using CRISPR–Cas9 method to assess GALC function and GALC secretion. We evaluated 5 polymorphic and 31 clinically–relevant MM variants (MMVs) using transient expression assays. Our results showed that 26 MMVs, including 10 co–variants with p.I562T, reduced GALC activity by 92% – 100% compared to wildtype GALC (WT–GALC). MMVs from infantile-onset KD patients produced < 2% of WT activity, whereas those associated with juvenile– and adult–onset cases retained up to 7% of WT activity. Residual GALC activity was correlated with mature, lysosomal GALC protein levels (Pearson r = 0.93, P<0.0001). Many low–activity MMVs did not correspondingly impair GALC secretion. Twenty–one of the 26 low–activity MMVs showed a 21% – 100% reduction in sec–GALC levels, indicating varying degrees of GALC mis–trafficking among these variants.
Importantly, GALC activity among MMVs strongly correlates with clinical disease severity, based on the age of symptom onset in patients with either homozygous MM (Pearson r = 0.98, P<0.0001, n = 7) or compound heterozygous (Pearson r = 0.94, P<0.0001, n = 12) MM–null mutation genotypes. Thus, our data suggests that GALC activity could serve as a prognostic disease indicator under specific experimental conditions. We further investigated the impact of pathogenic MMVs on psychosine accumulation, a key biomarker for KD. Psychosine levels were 21–fold higher in mock control cells compared to WT–GALC transfected cells (mock = 0.349 pmol/mg, WT–GALC = 0.016 pmol/mg), but negatively correlated with GALC activity among pathogenic MMVs (Pearson r = –0.63, P < 0.01, n = 15). Although psychosine levels were higher in most MMVs associated with infantile–onset KD, no significant correlations with clinical onset were detected.
Overall, our study provides a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the functional deficits and mis–trafficking associated with clinically–relevant GALC MMVs, enhancing our understanding of the molecular genetics and genotype–phenotype correlations of the GALC gene in Krabbe disease."
