Proportional recovery in mice with cortical stroke,"Aref,Carolin,Christian,Gereon R.,Markus,Aref,Carolin,Christian,Gereon R.,Markus,Aref,Carolin,Christian,Gereon R.,Markus","The proportional Recovery Rule (PRR) has been frequently used to predict recovery of lost motor function in acute stroke patients. However, it still needs to be explored whether the same concept applies to preclinical, i.e. animal models of stroke recovery. To address this question, we investigated behavioral data from 125 adult male C57Bl/6J mice with photothrombotic strokes in the sensorimotor cortex. Lesion size and location were determined in the first week using in vivo T2-weighted MRI. Motor recovery was evaluated repeatedly over four weeks using the cylinder, grid walk, and rotating beam test. Recovery trajectories were analyzed using a newly formulated Mouse Recovery Rule (MRR), comparing it against the traditional PRR. Initial findings indicated variable recovery patterns, which were separated using a stepwise linear regression approach resulting in two clusters: 47% PRR and 53% MRR. No significant correlation was found between recovery patterns and lesion size or location, suggesting that other biological factors drive individual differences in recovery. Of note, in the MRR cluster, animals recovered to 90% of their initial behavioral state within the first four weeks post-stroke, which is higher than the 70% recovery usually reported in human PRR studies. This study demonstrates the complexity of translating the PRR to stroke recovery models in mice and underscores the need for species-specific recovery models. Our findings have implications for designing and interpreting therapeutic strategies for stroke recovery in preclinical settings, with the potential to improve the predictive accuracy of stroke recovery assessments."
Learning is a fundamental source of behavioral individuality,"Riddha,Johanni,Goncalo Vasconcelos,Alireza,Ivan,Ana Marija,Riddha,Johanni,Goncalo Vasconcelos,Alireza,Ivan,Ana Marija,Riddha,Johanni,Goncalo Vasconcelos,Alireza,Ivan,Ana Marija","Learning and memory are thought to be essential for our individual uniqueness and sense of self (1). Yet, individuality is rarely studied in the context of behaviors that depend on learning. While it is established that such behaviors can vary across individuals, it remains unknown whether their variation stems from learning or from classical sources of individuality, the developmental stochasticity, environment and genetics (2-12). To answer this fundamental question, we measured behavior in thousands of flies in the presence and absence of learning, and compared the extent of their individuality. We discover an excess of non-normally distributed individual behavior only in flies that experienced learning, even though they were genetically identical, raised under the same conditions and exposed to the same environment as the non-learning flies. By tracking each fly's decision-making process, we find that learning does not simply change individual behavior, but it also diversifies it. We could recreate the emergence of this excess of individuality using computer simulations of behaving flies only when we enabled reinforced learning. Although individual experience and genetics shaped behavioral biases, we demonstrated that behavior can diverge due to learning even in individuals that share biases. Our results thus establish learning as the fundamental source of individuality, rather than a phenotypic outcome of genetics, environment, or development."
"Pairwise interactions, feedback rule changes, and deliberative decisions underlie honeybee inflight group coordination","Md. Saiful,Imraan,Md. Saiful,Imraan,Md. Saiful,Imraan","Systematic descriptions of the underlying interaction rules that insects use to support group and swarm flight has the potential to contribute to mathematics, biology, and robotics, including aerial swarming under sensory and computational limitations. This study analyzes 1,000 trajectories of flying honeybees in crowded conditions approaching a moving stimulus and finds how during this stimulus, honeybees coordinate flight through pairwise interactions involving a novel three-zone decision-making process. The experimental setup consists of 3-D position reconstructions via a high speed camera system recording honeybee foragers returning to a hive entrance actuated to move robotically. The analysis consists of neighborhood identification through three methods (cross-correlation, distance threshold, and average distance threshold), which reveals the dominant interaction is pairwise. The individual leader-follower pair interactions are then tested against three regulation candidates: optic flow, relative velocity, and optical expansion rate, based on minimizing root mean square error. The results show that each follower demonstrates a three stage process involving a feedback rule change, linked by an intermediate observation/decision phase. During the initial “lock” phase, an insect maintains a consistent optical expansion rate until inter-agent distance closes to 10 cm. The regulation candidates then undergo large variations during a relatively long observation/decision zone, with 1.04 seconds being the average time in the decision zone. 79% of the paired insect entries into the decision zone result in subsequent re-engagement to track the same initial leader, while 21% result in disengagement from the group behavior. Visual regulation candidate comparison in the third stage indicates that upon re-engagement, the follower relative velocity is regulated to provide consistent velocity matching between agents. The third stage’s velocity tracking is consistent with a closed-loop feedback proportional-integral (PI) controller regulating velocity tracking error. Across the insect population studied, the proportional gain remained showed minimal variability over individuals, a derivative gain was considered and found negligible, and the integral gain varied by individual. Collectively, these findings underscore the existence of an alternative swarm architecture, highlighting individual decision-making capabilities, feedback regulation target changes, and the presence of reactive, deliberative, and moderate (PI control) timescale interaction rules contained within aerial groups."
Api-TRACE: A System for Honey Bee Tracking in a Constrained Environment to Study Bee Learning Process and the Effect of Lithium on Learning,"Babur,Ayben,Sedat,Okan Can,Ayse Gul,Tugrul,Hande,Babur,Ayben,Sedat,Okan Can,Ayse Gul,Tugrul,Hande,Babur,Ayben,Sedat,Okan Can,Ayse Gul,Tugrul,Hande","Learning is an adaptive behavior that improves the performance of bees in foraging, dance communication, predator avoidance, and other tasks. Any deficiencies in learning could be detrimental to the long-term survival of the bee colony. Passive avoidance task is a fundamental procedure for investigating learning. We introduce Api-TRACE, a computer vision-aided system to analyze the avoidance assays. Api-TRACE tracks individual bees from the video footage of the assay and detects the moments when they were exposed to a stimulus. The algorithm provides stimulus exposure duration and learning profiles of each individual bee, enabling fast and detailed analysis of the results. Electric shock avoidance assay is one of the most common experimental methods to assess learning. We designed an apparatus for the electric shock avoidance experiments using within-reach hardware and 3D-printed components. We used Api-TRACE and experimental apparatus to investigate the effect of lithium on bee learning success in passive avoidance and reversal learning paradigms through an electric shock avoidance assay. Lithium is a potential chemical for combating ,, a bee (,) parasite, and a well-known medication for treating bipolar disorder. It has been known that lithium alters learning in humans and other animals. Before the experiment, we treated the bees with a sucrose solution with 0, 5, 25, and 125 mM LiCl ,. Our results indicated that a decrement in learning performance emerged with increasing lithium doses in the reversal phase but not in the acquisition of the electric shock avoidance assay."
Nonlinear Singular Value Decomposition Beamforming for Ultrasound Imaging of Gas Vesicles,"Ge,Mathis,Mohamed,Esteban,Nabil,Anatole,Thomas,Simon,Pascal,Claire,Mikhail,Mickael,Ge,Mathis,Mohamed,Esteban,Nabil,Anatole,Thomas,Simon,Pascal,Claire,Mikhail,Mickael,Ge,Mathis,Mohamed,Esteban,Nabil,Anatole,Thomas,Simon,Pascal,Claire,Mikhail,Mickael","Ultrasound imaging holds significant promise for the observation of molecular and cellular phenomena through the utilization of acoustic contrast agents and acoustic reporter genes. Optimizing imaging methodologies for enhanced detection represents an imperative advancement in this field. Most advanced techniques relying on amplitude modulation scheme such as cross amplitude modulation (xAM) and ultrafast amplitude modulation (uAM) combined with Hadamard encoded multiplane wave transmissions have shown efficacy in capturing acoustic signals of gas vesicles (GVs). Nonetheless, uAM sequence requires odd- or even-element transmissions leading to imprecise amplitude modulation emitting scheme, and the complex multiplane wave transmission scheme inherently yields overlong pulse durations. xAM sequence is limited in terms of field of view and imaging depth. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an innovative ultrafast imaging sequence called nonlinear singular value decomposition (SVD) beamforming. Our method demonstrated a contrast imaging sensitivity comparable to the current gold-standard xAM and uAM, while requiring 4.8 times less pulse transmissions. With similar number of transmit pulses, nonlinear SVD beamforming outperforms xAM and uAM in terms of an improvement in signal-to-background ratio of + 4.78 dB and + 8.29 dB respectively. Additionally, our method provides a higher flexibility in terms of the selection of acoustic pressure amplitude compared to the other methods. Furthermore, it shows a significant potential for application in the realm of ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM), where it stands poised to facilitate the more precise extraction of nonlinear signatures originating from contrast agents."
Direct M2 macrophage co-culture overrides viscoelastic hydrogel mechanics to promote fibroblast activation,"Leilani R,Mackenzie L,Steven R,Leilani R,Mackenzie L,Steven R,Leilani R,Mackenzie L,Steven R","Fibroblast activation drives fibrotic diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis. However, the complex interplay of how tissue mechanics and macrophage signals combine to influence fibroblast activation is not well understood. Here, we use hyaluronic acid hydrogels as a tunable cell culture system to mimic lung tissue stiffness and viscoelasticity. We applied this platform to investigate the influence of macrophage signaling on fibroblast activation. Fibroblasts cultured on stiff (50 kPa) hydrogels mimicking fibrotic tissue exhibit increased activation as measured by spreading as well as type I collagen and cadherin-11 expression compared to fibroblasts cultured on soft (1 kPa) viscoelastic hydrogels mimicking normal tissue. These trends were unchanged in fibroblasts cultured with macrophage-conditioned media. However, fibroblasts directly co-cultured with M2 macrophages show increased activation, even on soft viscoelastic hydrogels that normally suppress activation. Inhibition of interleukin 6 (IL6) signaling does not change activation in fibroblast-only cultures but ameliorates the pro-fibrotic effects of M2 macrophage co-culture. These results underscore the ability of direct M2 macrophage co-culture to override hydrogel viscoelasticity to promote fibroblast activation in an IL6-dependent manner. This work also highlights the utility of using hydrogels to deconstruct complex tissue microenvironments to better understand the interplay between microenvironmental mechanical and cellular cues."
Impact of social isolation stress on safety learning and the structure of defensive behavior during a spatial-based learning task involving thermal threat,"Stephanie A.,Ada C.,Kelly,John R.,Anthony,Stephanie A.,Ada C.,Kelly,John R.,Anthony,Stephanie A.,Ada C.,Kelly,John R.,Anthony","Safety learning during threat and adversity is critical for behavioral adaptation, resiliency, and survival. Using a novel mouse paradigm involving thermal threat, we recently demonstrated that safety learning is highly susceptible to stress. Yet, our previous study primarily considered male mice and did not thoroughly scrutinize the relative impacts of stress on potentially distinct defensive mechanisms implemented by males and females during the thermal task. The present study assessed these issues while analyzing a variety of defensive behaviors related to safety-seeking, escape, coping, protection, ambivalence, and risk-taking. After a two-week social isolation stress period, mice were required to explore a box arena that had thermal threat and safety zones (5°C vs 30°C, respectively). Since visuospatial cues clearly differentiated the threat and safety zones, the majority of the no-stress controls (69-75%) in both sexes exhibited optimal memory formation for the safety zone. In contrast, the majority of the stress-exposed mice in both sexes (69-75%) exhibited robust impairment in memory formation for the safety zone. Furthermore, while the control groups exhibited many robust correlations among various defensive behaviors, the stress-exposed mice in both sexes exhibited disorganized behaviors. Thus, stress severely impaired the proper establishment of safety memory and the structure of defensive behavior, effects that primarily occurred in a sex-independent manner."

Additionally, we have streamlined and simplified the process of stable transformation and selection of ,, reducing cost, time, and manual labour without compromising transformation efficiency. The addition of sucrose in the selection media significantly enhances the production of gemmae, accelerating the generation of isogenic plants. We believe these protocols have the potential to facilitate high-throughput screenings in diverse plant species and represent a significant step towards the full automation of plant transformation pipelines. This approach allows testing ∼100 constructs per month, using conventional plant tissue culture facilities. We recently demonstrated the successful implementation of this protocol for screening hundreds of fluorescent reporters in , gemmae."
Spheroplasted cells: a game changer for DNA delivery to diatoms,"E.J.L.,M.,G.,B.J.K.,E.J.L.,M.,G.,B.J.K.,E.J.L.,M.,G.,B.J.K.","Diatoms, vital to global carbon fixation and climate change mitigation, produce 20% of the world’s fixed organic carbon annually. Their potential as cell factories for biofuels, proteins, and other high value chemicals remains underutilized due to a lack of genetic engineering tools, with DNA delivery being the biggest challenge. Here, we present an optimized, highly efficient electroporation method for delivering DNA constructs as large as 55.6 kb to ,, a model diatom species and emerging chassis for algal biotechnology. We also demonstrate that with this optimized protocol, episomes can be assembled ,, forgoing the need for time-consuming traditional cloning steps in , and ,.

"Big Behavioral Data: Psychology, Ethology and the Foundations of Neuroscience","Alex,Joseph J.,Adam R.,Rui M.,Zachary F.,Alex,Joseph J.,Adam R.,Rui M.,Zachary F.,Alex,Joseph J.,Adam R.,Rui M.,Zachary F.","Behavior is a unifying organismal process through which genes, neural function, anatomy and environment converge and interrelate. Here we review the current state and sketch the future impact of accelerating advances in technology for behavioral studies, focusing on rodents as an exemplar. We frame our analysis in three dimensions: (1) degree of experimental constraint, (2) dimensionality of data, and (3) level of description. We argue that ethomics, fueled by “big behavioral data”, presents challenges proportionate to its promise and describe how these challenges might be met through opportunities afforded by the two rival conceptual legacies of 20, century behavioral science, ethology and psychology. We conclude that although “ethomes” are not the goal, big behavioral data has the potential to transform and unify these two disciplines and to solidify the foundations of others, including neuroscience, particularly if the data is as open as it is copious and quantitative."

Expansion of a bacterial operon during cancer treatment ameliorates drug toxicity,"Kai,Wesley A,Than S,Taylor,Christine A,Edwin F,Cecilia,Vaibhav,Dalila,Paige,Benjamin GH,Peter,Darren,Jessie A,Matthew D,Erin L,Alan P,Chloe E,Peter J,Kai,Wesley A,Than S,Taylor,Christine A,Edwin F,Cecilia,Vaibhav,Dalila,Paige,Benjamin GH,Peter,Darren,Jessie A,Matthew D,Erin L,Alan P,Chloe E,Peter J,Kai,Wesley A,Than S,Taylor,Christine A,Edwin F,Cecilia,Vaibhav,Dalila,Paige,Benjamin GH,Peter,Darren,Jessie A,Matthew D,Erin L,Alan P,Chloe E,Peter J","Dose-limiting toxicities remain a major barrier to drug development and therapy, revealing the limited predictive power of human genetics. Herein, we demonstrate the utility of a more comprehensive approach to studying drug toxicity through longitudinal study of the human gut microbiome during colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment (​​,) coupled to cell culture and mouse experiments. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed significant shifts in gut microbial community structure during oral fluoropyrimidine treatment across multiple patient cohorts, in mouse small and large intestinal contents, and in patient-derived ex vivo communities. Metagenomic sequencing revealed marked shifts in pyrimidine-related gene abundance during oral fluoropyrimidine treatment, including enrichment of the preTA operon, which is sufficient for the inactivation of active metabolite 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). preTA+ bacteria depleted 5-FU in gut microbiota grown ex vivo and the mouse distal gut. Germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice experienced increased fluoropyrimidine toxicity, which was rescued by colonization with the mouse gut microbiota, preTA+ E. coli, or preTA-high CRC patient stool. Finally, preTA abundance was negatively associated with fluoropyrimidine toxicity in patients. Together, these data support a causal, clinically relevant interaction between a human gut bacterial operon and the dose-limiting side effects of cancer treatment. Our approach is generalizable to other drugs, including cancer immunotherapies, and provides valuable insights into host-microbiome interactions in the context of disease."
Improving Split-HaloTag through Computational Protein Engineering,"Jonas,Lennart,Yin-Hsi,Julien,Kai,Jonas,Lennart,Yin-Hsi,Julien,Kai,Jonas,Lennart,Yin-Hsi,Julien,Kai","Split-HaloTag can be used to transform transient molecular interactions into permanent marks through chemical labeling, thereby enabling the recording of transient physiological events in individual cells. However, applications of split-HaloTag-based recorders can be limited by slow labeling rates. To address this issue, we have engineered an improved version of cpHaloΔ, the larger fragment of the split-HaloTag system. Using computational techniques, we identified stabilizing point mutations and designed a structured linker connecting the original N and C termini of the circular permutated protein, thereby significantly improving thermostability and activity of cpHaloΔ. These modifications decrease the time and substrate concentrations required for split-HaloTag-based assays and can expand their dynamic range and sensitivity."

Malaria parasites require a divergent heme oxygenase for apicoplast gene expression and biogenesis,"Amanda Mixon,Yasaman,Armiyaw S.,Shota,Akinobu,Celine,Kouhei,James A.,Jose M.

M.,Daniel E.,Paul A.","Malaria parasites have evolved unusual metabolic adaptations that specialize them for growth within heme-rich human erythrocytes. During blood-stage infection, , parasites internalize and digest abundant host hemoglobin within the digestive vacuole. This massive catabolic process generates copious free heme, most of which is biomineralized into inert hemozoin. Parasites also express a divergent heme oxygenase (HO)-like protein (PfHO) that lacks key active-site residues and has lost canonical HO activity. The cellular role of this unusual protein that underpins its retention by parasites has been unknown. To unravel PfHO function, we first determined a 2.8 Å-resolution X-ray structure that revealed a highly α-helical fold indicative of distant HO homology. Localization studies unveiled PfHO targeting to the apicoplast organelle, where it is imported and undergoes N-terminal processing but retains most of the electropositive transit peptide. We observed that conditional knockdown of PfHO was lethal to parasites, which died from defective apicoplast biogenesis and impaired isoprenoid-precursor synthesis. Complementation and molecular-interaction studies revealed an essential role for the electropositive N-terminus of PfHO, which selectively associates with the apicoplast genome and enzymes involved in nucleic acid metabolism and gene expression. PfHO knockdown resulted in a specific deficiency in levels of apicoplast-encoded RNA but not DNA. These studies reveal an essential function for PfHO in apicoplast maintenance and suggest that , repurposed the conserved HO scaffold from its canonical heme-degrading function in the ancestral chloroplast to fulfill a critical adaptive role in organelle gene expression."

BIMSA: Accelerating Long Sequence Alignment Using Processing-In-Memory,"Alejandro,Ivan,Quim,Juan,Santiago,Onur,Miquel,Alejandro,Ivan,Quim,Juan,Santiago,Onur,Miquel,Alejandro,Ivan,Quim,Juan,Santiago,Onur,Miquel","Motivation: Recent advances in sequencing technologies have stressed the critical role of sequence analysis algorithms and tools in genomics and healthcare research. In particular, sequence alignment is a fundamental building block in many sequence analysis pipelines and is frequently a performance-critical bottleneck both in time and memory. Classical sequence alignment algorithms are based on dynamic programming and often require quadratic time and memory with respect to the sequence length. As a result, classic sequence alignment algorithms fail to scale with increasing sequence lengths and quickly become memory-bound due to data-movement penalties. Results: Processing-In-Memory (PIM) is an emerging architectural paradigm that seeks to accelerate memory-bound algorithms by bringing computation closer to the data to mitigate data-movement penalties. This work presents BIMSA (Bidirectional In-Memory Sequence Alignment), a PIM-optimized implementation of the state-of-the-art sequence alignment algorithm BiWFA (Bidirectional Wavefront Alignment), incorporating hardware-aware optimizations for a production-ready PIM architecture (UPMEM). BIMSA achieves speedups up to 22.24x (11.95x on average) compared to state-of-the-art PIM-enabled implementations of sequence alignment algorithms, and supports aligning sequences of thousands of bases, exceeding the limitations of current PIM-accelerated implementations. BIMSA also achieves speedups up to 5.84x (2.83x on average) compared to the most efficient multicore CPU implementation of BiWFA. Most notably, BIMSA exhibits linear scalability with the number of compute units, enabling further performance improvements with upcoming PIM architectures equipped with more compute units and achieving speedups up to 9.56x (4.7x on average)."
"Using Glittr.org to find, compare and re-use online materials for training and education","Geert,Yann,Monique,Patricia,Geert,Yann,Monique,Patricia,Geert,Yann,Monique,Patricia","A wealth of excellent training and educational materials for the computational life sciences are scattered around the Internet, but they can be hard to find. Many materials reside in public Git repositories that are hosted on platforms such as GitHub and GitLab. Glittr.org is a manually curated database of Git repositories, which enables users to find educational materials that would otherwise be hard to identify. With the application, users can search and compare educational materials based on topic and author, but also on engagement metrics such as stargazers (bookmarks) and recency (days since last commit). Glittr.org currently contains 664 entries, which are assigned to six different categories within the domain of computational life sciences. By analysing the database, we reveal insights in the availability of materials per topic, collaboration patterns of developers, and licensing practices. This knowledge helps to understand in which areas open educational materials are scant, the importance of Git for collaboration on educational materials and how licensing can be improved to enhance sharing and reuse. Taken together, we show that Glittr.org contains a wealth of connected and openly available metadata. Therefore, it enhances adherence to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, which benefits learners, teachers and trainers in the entire life sciences community and beyond."

A ChatGPT Assisted Reading Protocol for Undergraduate Research Students Engaging with Biophysics Literature,"Marcus,Gonzalo R.,Anne V.,Frank X.,Marcus,Gonzalo R.,Anne V.,Frank X.,Marcus,Gonzalo R.,Anne V.,Frank X.","A major challenge for undergraduate students engaged in research is reading scientific literature. This is especially true for students engaged in biophysics research, where many of the concepts, definitions, and experimental methodologies discussed may be beyond the material covered in standard undergraduate courses. Without specific guidance on how to read journal articles, students can become overwhelmed, which may lead to students reading fewer papers and not engaging with the scientific literature related to their research. To help undergraduate students effectively engage with scientific papers, we have developed a guided reading protocol that combines pre-reading strategies, structured notetaking, and the use of ChatGPT. Using ChatGPT in this protocol allows students to clarify unfamiliar terms and concepts in an interactive way that helps them to integrate the paper’s content into their own understanding. To test the impact of this protocol, participants in this study were given an initial survey to determine their comfort and experience with reading scientific literature. After this they were given an abridged biophysics paper and the ChatGPT assisted guided reading protocol. The ChatGPT transcripts were analyzed using open coding and the students were given a post-study survey to determine how they felt about their experience using ChatGPT. We found that most students do not appear to engage with the literature regularly, which may be due to barriers they encounter in terms of new and unknown content. Analyzing their conversations with the chatbot, we observed that students asked for definitions, explanations of unknown concepts, summaries of text or their own understanding, and simplifications of the text. Overall, students reported in the post-implementation survey that using ChatGPT was a positive experience and all students reported that they expected to use ChatGPT in the future when reading scientific literature. From this work, we believe that this new chatbot assisted reading protocol may be a way to keep novice biophysics students from becoming discouraged when they begin reading scientific literature and help keep them engaged with the current literature in the field."
Functional clustering of splice-altering variants in whole genome sequencing data reveals hidden heritability in rare variant disorder,"Yan,Charlotte,Ilia,Paul J.,Brendan,Maarten,Eleonora,R.

Jeroen,Leonard,Johnathan,Jan,Kevin","Explaining missing heritability in rare disorders requires effective methods to interpret genetic variants. Sequence-to-function models such as SpliceAI support discovery of splice altering variants but filtering their output to identify pathogenic mutations remains challenging. We developed SpliPath to address 2 unmet needs in this process. First, SpliPath links the output of SpliceAI with reference transcriptomics data. This allows users to identify genetic variants that induce unannotated splice isoforms selectively expressed in disease models or patient tissue. Second, SpliPath aggregates variants with similar functional consequences into collapsed splicing quantitative trait loci (csQTLs) for more powerful genetic association analyses. We first used SpliPath to annotate whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 9,467 ALS patients and controls using RNAseq data from an iPSC model of TDP-43 dysfunction. Through this, SpliPath identified 53 variants predicted to enhance cryptic exon (CE) retention events associated with a core ALS pathomechanism. We then applied SpliPath to 294 ALS patients where both WGS and RNAseq were available and discovered missing genetic risk in the known ALS gene KIF5A. This revealed a first of kind intronic mutation hotspot that was validated using minigene reporter assays. Finally, using the same RNAseq data we then predicted 754 candidate csQTL for an independent WGS cohort of 6,625 ALS patients and 2,472 controls. Unbiased genomewide csQTL association testing successfully recovered KIF5A and nominated EPG5 as a potential pathogenic gene. These effects were undetectable using simplistic SpliceAI gene burden tests. Collectively, our study demonstrates the utility of SpliPath for uncovering missing heritability in rare disorders."
Data-driven evaluation of suitable immunogens for improved antibody selection,"Katharina,Hlin,Henrik,Kaj,Charlotte E,Sanne,Katharina,Hlin,Henrik,Kaj,Charlotte E,Sanne,Katharina,Hlin,Henrik,Kaj,Charlotte E,Sanne","Antibodies are indispensable in laboratory and clinical applications due to their high specificity and affinity for protein antigens. However, selecting the right protein fragments as immunogens for antibody production remains challenging. Leveraging the Human Protein Atlas, this study systematically evaluates immunogen properties aiming to identify key factors that influence their suitability. Antibodies were classified as successful or unsuccessful based on standardized validation experiments, and the structural and functional properties of their immunogens were analysed. Results indicated that longer immunogens often resulted in more successful but less specific antibodies. Shorter immunogens (50 residues or fewer) with disordered or unfolded regions at the N- or C-terminus and long coil stretches were more likely to generate successful antibodies. Conversely, immunogens with high beta sheet content, multiple secondary structure elements, transmembrane regions, or disulfide bridges were associated with poorer antibody performance. Post-translational modification sites within immunogens appeared to mark beneficial regions for antibody generation. To support antibody selection, a novel R package, immunogenViewer, was developed, enabling researchers to easily apply these insights when immunogen sequences are disclosed. By providing a deeper understanding of immunogen suitability, this study promotes the development of more effective antibodies, ultimately addressing issues of reproducibility and reliability in antibody-based research. The findings are highly relevant to the research community, as end-users often lack control over the immunogen selection process in antibody production."

A theoretical basis for cell deaths,"Yusuke,Shuhei A.,Tetsuya J.,Yusuke,Shuhei A.,Tetsuya J.,Yusuke,Shuhei A.,Tetsuya J.","Understanding deaths and life-death boundaries of cells is a fundamental challenge in biological sciences. In this study, we present a theoretical framework for investigating cell death. We conceptualize cell death as a controllability problem within dynamical systems, and compute the life-death boundary through the development of “stoichiometric rays”. This method utilizes enzyme activity as control parameters, exploiting the inherent property of enzymes to enhance reaction rates without affecting thermodynamic potentials. This approach facilitates the efficient evaluation of the global controllability of models. We demonstrate the utility of our framework using its application to a toy metabolic model, where we delineate the life-death boundary. The formulation of cell death through mathematical principles provides a foundation for the theoretical study of cellular mortality."
Time-dependent computational model of post-traumatic osteoarthritis to estimate how mechanoinflammatory mechanisms impact cartilage aggrecan content,"Atte S A,Joonas P,Moustafa,Amir,Cristina,Alan J,Petri,Rami K,Atte S A,Joonas P,Moustafa,Amir,Cristina,Alan J,Petri,Rami K,Atte S A,Joonas P,Moustafa,Amir,Cristina,Alan J,Petri,Rami K","Degenerative musculoskeletal diseases like osteoarthritis can be initiated by joint injury. Injurious overloading-induced mechanical straining of articular cartilage and subsequent biological responses may trigger cartilage degradation. One early sign of degradation is loss of aggrecan content which is potentially accelerated near chondral lesions under physiological loading. Yet, the mechanoinflammatory mechanisms explaining time-dependent degradation in regions with disparate mechanical loading are unclear and challenging to assess with experiments alone. Here, we developed computational models unraveling potential mechanisms behind aggrecan content adaptation. Incorporating mechanical strain-driven cell damage and downstream proteolytic enzyme release, fluid flow-driven aggrecan depletion, and fluid pressure-stimulated regulation of aggrecan biosynthesis, the models agreed with experiments and exhibited 14%-points greater near-lesion aggrecan loss after 12 days of physiological loading compared to without loading. This significant advancement in mechanistic understanding incorporated into cartilage adaptation model can help in development and guidance of personalized therapies, such as rehabilitation protocols and tissue-engineered constructs."

Scalable enumeration and sampling of minimal metabolic pathways for organisms and communities,"Ove,Axel,Jörg,Ove,Axel,Jörg,Ove,Axel,Jörg","Many interactions in microbial consortia or tissues of multicellular organisms rely on networks of metabolite exchanges. To predict community function and composition beyond statistical correlations, one can use genome-scale metabolic models. However, comprehensive model analysis via metabolic pathways is a major challenge because pathway counts grow combinatorially with model size. Here, we define minimal pathways that yield compact representations of metabolic network capabilities. They generalize existing pathway concepts by allowing inhomogeneous constraints and targeted analysis of subnetworks, and we show how to enumerate and sample them efficiently via iterative minimization and pathway graphs. This enables applications such as assessing quantitative gene essentiality in the central metabolism of ,, predicting metabolite exchanges associated with homeostasis and health in a host-microbe model of the human gut, and designing butyrate-producing microbial communities. Minimal pathways enable scalable analysis of metabolic subnetworks such as metabolite exchanges in uni- and multicellular systems."
Whole-Process 3D ECM-Encapsulated Organoid-Based Automated High-Throughput Screening Platform Accelerates Drug Discovery for Rare Diseases,"Zhaoting,Hui,Yuru,Emmanuel Enoch,Bing,Zhaoting,Hui,Yuru,Emmanuel Enoch,Bing,Zhaoting,Hui,Yuru,Emmanuel Enoch,Bing","The use of organoids, especially patient-derived organoids, for high-throughput screening (HTS) is widely accepted due to their ability to mimic the three-dimensional (3D) structure, function, and drug responses of in vivo tissues. However, the complexity of handling extracellular matrix (ECM) components with traditional HTS devices leads to the utilization of suspension cultures in matrix-free or matrix-low conditions during HTS, which can alter their transcriptomic landscape and drug responses. Here, we develop a whole-process 3D ECM-encapsulated organoid-based automated HTS (wp3D-OAHTS) platform, which enables the rapid and accurate generation of uniformly distributed 3D cell-matrix mixture domes at the center of each well in 96-well plates. This approach replicates the process of manual organoid culture but with superior stability and reproducibility. Utilizing this platform, we screened 2,802 compounds on neuroendocrine cervical cancer organoids, a rare malignancy with significant unmet clinical needs. We identified 7 top hits that display strong anti-tumor effects with remarkably low half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC,) and validated the in vivo efficacy of Quisinostat 2HCl. Additionally, we demonstrated that employing 3D ECM-encapsulated organoid cultures for HTS, rather than suspended cultures, provides optimal conditions for drug discovery. Our wp3D-OAHTS platform significantly improves the rapidity and efficiency of new drug discovery for rare diseases."

Assessment of a high-throughput mass spectrometry method to accelerate biomarker discovery in clinical cancer cohorts using volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) devices,"N.,C.,D.,R.,B.,E.,N.,C.,D.,R.,B.,E.,N.,C.,D.,R.,B.,E.","Identification of biomarkers of early-stage disease typically requires analysis of very large cohorts which can only be reasonably achieved using high-throughput methods. We have developed and optimised novel methods for whole blood analysis using volumetric absorptive microsampling devices to produce over 3000 protein identifications by LCMS on a Q Exactive HF-X Orbitrap. These methods were tested using a set of whole blood samples from lung cancer patients and matching healthy controls finding 455 differentially expressed proteins, using a mid-throughput method enabling analysis of 18 samples per day. To increase throughput for larger clinical cohorts, a 60-sample per day method was tested on a Sciex ZenoTOF 7600. The high-throughput method produced 1.5-fold fewer protein identifications and a higher overall % CV compared to the mid-throughput method. Despite the lower numbers, it produced a set of 36 disease-relevant and discriminatory differentially expressed proteins that, using a machine learning model, could differentiate between the disease and control samples with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 88.9% using random forest algorithms. These data support the use of high-throughput mass spectrometry methods to screen large cohorts for diagnostic biomarkers that can then be followed up with more targeted analyses."

"Across Thermal Scales: Quantized Thermodynamics, Nested Resonant Structures, and the Entropic Stability of Life","Josh E.,Josh E.,Josh E.","Biological systems are fundamentally containers of thermally fluctuating atoms that through unknown mechanisms are structurally layered across many thermal scales from atoms to amino acids to primary, secondary, and tertiary structures to functional proteins to functional macromolecular assemblies and up. Understanding how chemical thermodynamics sc ales across these layered structures is central to describing biological structure and function. Muscle – with chemical thermodynamics well-defined on two different thermal scales – provides a clear solution to this problem. In 1938, A.V. Hill made the extraordinary observation that the mechanics and chemistry of muscle contraction is defined independent of the structural components of muscle, implying that the mechanics and chemistry of myosin motor proteins within muscle do not classically scale up to muscle. We have demonstrated experimentally that thermal scaling bridges Hill’s top-down thermodynamics and the bottom-up philosophy of molecular biologists. That is, with thermal scaling , individual myosin motor switches physically collapse into an ensemble of , myosin motor switches creating a functional entropy within the ensemble well defined by the statistical mechanics of a binary system of switches. This ensemble entropy stabilizes the resonant ensemble structure of muscle and energetically drives the irreversible kinetics and energetics of muscle contraction. Here I develop a general model of thermal scaling and show that it occurs when the ensemble state of a system is defined, at which point the number of ways constituent molecules can account for the ensemble state contributes to the entropy of the ensemble state. At that point, the statistical occupancy of molecular states physically replaces the physical occupancy of molecular states. This is not a classical mechanism and as shown here results in many quantum-like phenomena, which consistent with Hill’s observation means that biological function cannot be described by classical molecular mechanisms."

Evaluation of information flows in the RAS-MAPK system using transfer entropy measurements,"Nobuhisa,Yoshiyuki,Yasushi,Nobuhisa,Yoshiyuki,Yasushi,Nobuhisa,Yoshiyuki,Yasushi","The RAS-MAPK system plays an important role in regulating various cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and transformation. Dysregulation of this system has been implicated in genetic diseases and cancers affecting diverse tissues. To better understand the regulation of this system, we employed information flow analysis based on transfer entropy (TE) between the activation dynamics of two key elements in cells stimulated with EGF: SOS, a guanine nucleotide exchanger for the small GTPase RAS, and RAF, a RAS effector serine/threonine kinase. TE analysis allows for model-free assessment of the timing, direction, and strength of the information flow regulating the system response. We detected significant amounts of TE in both directions between SOS and RAF, indicating feedback regulation. Importantly, the amount of TE did not simply follow the input dose or the intensity of the causal reaction, demonstrating the uniqueness of TE. TE analysis proposed regulatory networks containing multiple tracks and feedback loops and revealed temporal switching in the reaction pathway primarily responsible for reaction control. This proposal was confirmed by the effects of a MEK inhibitor on TE. Furthermore, TE analysis identified the functional disorder of a SOS mutation associated with Noonan syndrome, a human genetic disease, of which the pathogenic mechanism has not been precisely known yet. TE assessment holds significant promise as a model-free analysis method of reaction networks in molecular pharmacology and pathology."

Among these, the genus ,, a common soil saprotroph of the Mucoromycota phylum, stands out for its rapid growth, low nutritional requirements, and ability to produce substantial amounts of lipids, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Despite previous studies on lipid production in ,, metabolic engineering has been underexplored. This study fills that gap by presenting the first comprehensive metabolic model for , sp.

The model demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, correctly predicting metabolic capabilities in 82.1% of cases when evaluated against experimental data. Using the Flux Scanning based on Enforced Objective Flux (FSEOF) algorithm, the study identified 33 genes linked to 23 metabolic reactions. Notably, reactions catalysed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase and carbonic anhydrase emerged as prime candidates for up-regulation. These findings provide a solid framework for future metabolic engineering efforts to optimize PUFA production in , strains."
MSFragger-DDA+ Enhances Peptide Identification Sensitivity with Full Isolation Window Search,"Fengchao,Yamei,Alexey,Fengchao,Yamei,Alexey,Fengchao,Yamei,Alexey","Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based proteomics, particularly in the bottom-up approach, relies on the digestion of proteins into peptides for subsequent separation and analysis. The most prevalent method for identifying peptides from data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry data is database search. Traditional tools typically focus on identifying a single peptide per tandem mass spectrum (MS2), often neglecting the frequent occurrence of peptide co-fragmentations leading to chimeric spectra. Here, we introduce MSFragger-DDA+, a novel database search algorithm that enhances peptide identification by detecting co-fragmented peptides with high sensitivity and speed. Utilizing MSFragger's fragment ion indexing algorithm, MSFragger-DDA+ performs a comprehensive search within the full isolation window for each MS2, followed by robust feature detection, filtering, and rescoring procedures to refine search results. Evaluation against established tools across diverse datasets demonstrated that, integrated within the FragPipe computational platform, MSFragger-DDA+ significantly increases identification sensitivity while maintaining stringent false discovery rate (FDR) control. It is also uniquely suited for wide-window acquisition (WWA) data. MSFragger-DDA+ provides an efficient and accurate solution for peptide identification, enhancing the detection of low-abundance co-fragmented peptides. Coupled with the FragPipe platform, MSFragger-DDA+ enables more comprehensive and accurate analysis of proteomics data."
Statistics in service of metascience: Measuring replication distance with reproducibility rate,"Erkan,Berna,Erkan,Berna,Erkan,Berna","Motivated by the recent putative reproducibility crisis, we discuss the relationship between replicability of scientific studies, reproducibility of results obtained in these replications, and the philosophy of statistics. Our approach focuses on challenges in specifying scientific studies for scientific inference via statistical inference, and is complementary to classical discussions in philosophy of statistics. We particularly consider the challenges in replicating studies exactly, using the notion of the idealized experiment. We argue against treating reproducibility as an inherently desirable property of scientific results, and in favor of viewing it as a tool to measure distance between an original study and its replications. To sensibly study the implications of replicability and results reproducibility on inference, such a measure of replication distance is needed. We present an effort to delineate such a framework here, addressing some challenges in capturing the components of scientific studies while identifying others as ongoing issues. We illustrate our measure of replication distance by simulations using a toy example. Rather than replications, we present purposefully planned modifications as an appropriate tool to inform scientific inquiry. Our ability to measure replication distance serves scientists in their search for replication-ready studies. We believe that likelihood-based and evidential approaches may play a critical role towards building a statistics that effectively serves the practical needs of science."

Information on the genetic variability and trait associations of common bean in the Sekota district of north Western Ethiopia is inadequate. This study was initiated with the objective to assess variability, heritability and trait association among 64 common bean genotypes for quantitative traits using 8x8 simple lattice design at Aybra main research site 2023 under rain fed conditions. Analysis of variance was performed using SAS software and the ANOVA revealed highly significant variations among genotypes for all the traits considered in the study. The yield ranged from 1633.1 to 3702.10 kg ha, with a mean of 2542.53 kg ha,. There was a yield advantage of 24.56 to 55.89% over the checks. A moderate genotypic coefficient of variation coupled with high heritability and high genetic advance as a percentage of the mean was obtained for plant height, branches per plant, hundred seed weight, seed yield, and harvest index. Branches per plant, aboveground biomass and harvest index had significant positive correlations and direct effects on seed yield at the genotypic and phenotypic levels while days to maturity had a significant negative correlation and indirect effect with seed yield at the genotypic. The maximum inter cluster distance was found between clusters VII and 8 (D, =351.39), followed by clusters V and VIII (D, =331.23). The first five principal component axes accounted for 74.3% of the total variation, with eigenvalues greater than unity. The number of days to maturity, plant height, number of pods per plant, number seeds per pod, seed yield, and harvest index were the traits that contributed most of the variation in the first PCs. Generally, the presence of variability, and strong positive association of traits among the genotypes were observed in the traits under study. Therefore, selection based on agronomic performance and hybridization based on cluster distance could be possible for the improvement of common bean in the study area."

Predicting treatment-free remission outcomes in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia patients using an integrated model of tumor-immune dynamics,"Artur C.,Ingo,Ingmar,Artur C.,Ingo,Ingmar,Artur C.,Ingo,Ingmar","The interactions between tumor and the immune system are main factors in determining cancer treatment outcomes. In Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), considerable evidence shows that the dynamics between residual leukemia and the patient’s immune system can result in either sustained disease control, leading to treatment-free remission (TFR), or disease recurrence. The question remains how to integrate mechanistic and data-driven models to support prediction of treatment outcomes. Starting from classical ecological modeling concepts, which allow to explicitly account for immune interactions at the cellular level, we incorporate time-course data on natural killer (NK) cell number, function, and their tumor-induced suppression into a model of CML treatment. We identify relevant time scales governing treatment and immune response, enabling refined model calibration using tumor and NK cell time courses from different datasets. While the model successfully describes patient-specific response dynamics, critical parameters for predicting treatment outcome remain uncertain. However, by explicitly incorporating tumor load changes in response to TKI dose alterations, these parameters can be estimated and used to derive model predictions for treatment cessation. Further exploring dynamic changes in the number of functional immune cells, we suggest specific measurement strategies of immune effector cell populations to enhance prediction accuracy for CML recurrence following treatment cessation. The generalizability and flexibility of our approach represent a significant step towards quantitative, personalized medicine that integrates tumor-immune dynamics to guide clinical decisions and optimize dynamic cancer therapies."

Development of the Follow-Up Discourse Observation Protocol (FUDOP) for characterizing instructor active-learning follow-up behaviors,"Xinjian,Maci,Rachel,Petra,Stanley M.,Jeffrey,Melinda T.,Xinjian,Maci,Rachel,Petra,Stanley M.,Jeffrey,Melinda T.,Xinjian,Maci,Rachel,Petra,Stanley M.,Jeffrey,Melinda T.","Instructors can provide feedback to their class in multiple ways. One way is through their follow-up behaviors, which are the specific strategies instructors implement after active learning activities. These behaviors could play an important role in student learning as students can receive feedback from the instructor. However, there is little research on the effects of different types of follow-up behaviors. Follow-up after active learning can be seen as a form of discourse between the instructor and the entire class. Previous researchers developed the Classroom Discourse Observation Protocol (CDOP) to analyze discourse between the instructor and individual students or small groups. We used CDOP as a starting point to develop and validate a new protocol, the Follow-Up Discourse Observation Protocol (FUDOP), to characterize instructional follow-up behaviors to the entire class after active-learning activities. We then used FUDOP to characterize follow-up behaviors of multiple instructors in introductory biology courses at three different universities. We measured consistent differences in these behaviors across instructors but not within instructors, demonstrating that instructors may engage in consistent follow-up behaviors. FUDOP could allow instructors and researchers to better measure and analyze follow-up behaviors and their effects, which could in turn provide guidance to instructors and faculty developers."

Thus, understanding mechanisms of disease susceptibility and resilience, which vary by species, is important.

In this study, we characterize metabolomes of four species of visually healthy stony corals, including ,, ,, ,, and ,, collected at least a year before stony coral tissue loss disease reached the Dry Tortugas, Florida and demonstrate that both symbiont and host-derived biochemical pathways vary by species. Metabolomes of , displayed minimal intraspecies variability and highest biological activity against coral pathogens when compared to other species in this study. Application of advanced metabolite annotation methods enabled delineation of several pathways underlying interspecies variability. Specifically, endosymbiont-derived vitamin E family compounds, betaine lipids, and host-derived acylcarnitines were among the top predictors of interspecies variability. Since several metabolite features that contributed to inter- and intraspecies variation are synthesized by the endosymbiotic Symbiodiniaceae, which could be a major source of these compounds in corals, our data will guide further investigations into these Symbiodiniaceae-derived pathways."

In this investigation, we aimed to identify diagnostic markers and analyzed the therapeutic potential of essential genes.  Next generation sequencing (NGS) dataset GSE180313 was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HCM. DEGs were screened using the DESeq2 Rbioconductor tool. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) and REACTOME pathway enrichment analyses were performed. Moreover, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs was constructed, and module analysis was performed. Next, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network were constructed and analyzed. Finally, diagnostic values of hub genes were assessed by  by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. By performing DEGs analysis, total 958 DEGs ( 479 up regulated genes and 479 down regulated genes) were successfully identified from GSE180313, respectively. GO and REACTOME pathway enrichment analyses revealed that GO functions  and signaling pathways were significantly enriched including response to stimulus, multicellular organismal process, metabolism and extracellular matrix organization. The hub genes of FN1, SOX2, TUBA4A, RPS2, TUBA1C, ESR1, SNCA, LCK, PAK1 and APLNR might be associated with HCM.

Single-cell dynamics reveal a stress-induced decision between cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis,"Bryan,Lavie,Jeffrey J,Bryan,Lavie,Jeffrey J,Bryan,Lavie,Jeffrey J","Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis underlie cardiomyopathies and heart failure. While previous studies have described hypertrophy or apoptosis at the level of cell populations, how individual cells commit to these distinct yet co-regulated fates is unclear. We developed a high-content microscopy approach to track single-cell hypertrophy and apoptosis dynamics, revealing new features and unique subpopulation responses. The catecholamine isoproterenol induced both analog hypertrophy and digital apoptosis. While high-dose isoproterenol induced mixed hypertrophy and apoptosis at the population level, we found that individual cells that hypertrophy are more likely to survive. Likewise, phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy was associated with survival at the single-cell level.  Inhibiting caspase-3 reduced apoptosis and increased a cell likelihood of hypertrophy. Multinomial log-linear models demonstrate that a cell initial size and DNA content predict its susceptibility to hypertrophy or apoptosis. These data support a grow-or-die conceptual model for cardiomyocyte decisions. This work develops a single-cell profiling method to reveal that while hypertrophy and apoptosis often coincide at the population level, single cells that hypertrophy are protected from death."

NeKo allows users to provide their molecules of interest (e.g., genes, proteins or phosphosites), select interaction resources and apply flexible strategies to build networks based on prior knowledge. Users can filter interactions by various criteria, such as direct or indirect links and signed or unsigned interactions, to tailor the network to their needs and downstream analysis. We demonstrate some of NeKo's capabilities in two use cases: first we construct a network based on transcriptomics from medulloblastoma; in the second, we model drug synergies. NeKo streamlines the network-building process, making it more accessible and efficient for researchers. The tool is available at https://sysbio-curie.github.io/Neko/."
Enhancing student comprehension of paternity assignment in molecular primatology: a pilot study using a Shiny web application in Kenya,"David K.,Jordan A.,Daniel M.,Mercy Y.,Jenny,David K.,Jordan A.,Daniel M.,Mercy Y.,Jenny,David K.,Jordan A.,Daniel M.,Mercy Y.,Jenny","Kinship is a major determinant of affiliative and mating behavior in primates. In field studies, identifying kin typically relies in part on genetic analysis, especially for discriminating paternal relationships. Such analyses assume knowledge of Mendelian inheritance, genotyping technologies, and basic statistical inference. Consequently, they can be difficult for students to grasp, particularly through traditional lecture formats. Here, we investigate whether integrating an additional active learning approach—interaction with a Shiny web application,, which implements a popular paternity inference approach in an accessible graphical user interface—improves student understanding of genetic kinship analysis in molecular primatology. We do so in the context of a non-traditional learning environment in Kenya, a developing nation in which students have limited access to technology, and where the efficacy of educational Shiny apps has never been assessed. Twenty-eight (28) participants with diverse educational backgrounds attended an introductory lecture on genetics and paternity inference, completed a pre-test, interacted with , via a structured set of exercises and questions, and then completed a post-test and survey about their experience and subjective understanding. Post-test scores significantly improved relative to pre-test scores (p-value=3.75 × 10, .

From impact metrics and open science to communicating research: Journalists’ awareness of academic controversies,"Alice,Laura L.,Juan Pablo,Michelle,Lauren A.,Alice,Laura L.,Juan Pablo,Michelle,Lauren A.,Alice,Laura L.,Juan Pablo,Michelle,Lauren A.","This study sheds light on how journalists respond to evolving debates within academia around topics including research integrity, improper use of metrics to measure research quality and impact, and the risks and benefits of the open science movement. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 19 health and science journalists, we describe journalists’ awareness of these controversies and the ways in which that awareness, in turn, shapes the practices they use to select, verify, and communicate research. Our findings suggest that journalists’ perceptions of debates in scholarly communication vary widely, with some displaying a highly critical and nuanced understanding and others presenting a more limited awareness. Those with a more in-depth understanding report closely scrutinizing the research they report, carefully vetting the study design, methodology, and analyses. Those with a more limited awareness are more trusting of the peer review system as a quality control system and more willing to rely on researchers when determining what research to report on and how to vet and frame it. We discuss the benefits and risks of these varied perceptions and practices, highlighting the implications for the nature of the research media coverage that reaches the public."

This large knowledge gap prevents the biological community from fully leveraging the plethora of genomic data that is now available. Machine-learning approaches are showing some promise in propagating functional knowledge from experimentally characterized proteins to the correct set of isofunctional orthologs. However, they largely fail to predict enzymatic functions unseen in the training set, as shown by dissecting the predictions made for 450 enzymes of unknown function from the model bacteria Escherichia coli using the DeepECTransformer platform. Lessons from these failures can help the community develop machine-learning methods that assist domain experts in making testable functional predictions for more members of the uncharacterized proteome."
The influence of visual attention on letter recognition and reading acquisition in Arabic,"Alaa,Emmanuel,Dominique,Sylviane,Alaa,Emmanuel,Dominique,Sylviane,Alaa,Emmanuel,Dominique,Sylviane","The present study sets out to explore the cognitive underpinnings of reading acquisition in Arabic. Previous studies have identified phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming as early predictors. However, the graphic complexity of Arabic letters imposes particular constraints on the visual system, which should mobilize visual attention. To test this hypothesis, 101 Arabic-speaking children who just began their formal reading instruction in Arabic were administered tests of syllable and word reading. Their nonverbal reasoning, vocabulary, phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming and letter knowledge were measured. Their visual attention was estimated through tasks of visual attention span. We found that phonological awareness, visual attention span and letter knowledge were associated with reading outcomes. However, regression analyses showed that the relationship between visual attention span and reading disappeared when letter knowledge was taken-into-account. We used structural equation modeling to examine the direct and indirect effects of visual attention span to reading. Results showed that phonological awareness and letter knowledge were significant and independent predictors of reading while visual attention span contributed only indirectly through its influence on letter knowledge. Our findings suggest that beginning readers rely on visual attention to identify and discriminate visually-complex Arabic letters. In turn, more efficient letter identification in children with higher visual attention facilitates reading acquisition. These findings support the cognitive models of word recognition that include visual attention as a component of the reading system. They open new perspectives for cross-language studies, suggesting that visual attention might contribute differently to reading depending on the orthographic system. They also provide a foundation for innovative teaching methodologies in Arabic language education."
Bibliometric Analysis of Circular RNA Cancer Vaccines and Their Emerging Impact,"Uddalak,Soupayan,Meghna,Uddalak,Soupayan,Meghna,Uddalak,Soupayan,Meghna","Circular RNA (circRNA) vaccines are emerging as a revolutionary strategy in cancer immunotherapy, offering novel mechanisms for inducing robust and durable immune responses. Unlike traditional linear mRNA vaccines, circRNAs exhibit exceptional stability, enhanced translational efficiency, and resistance to exonuclease degradation, making them ideal candidates for vaccine development.

Chemical Space Localization for Unknown Metabolite Annotation via Semantic Similarity of Mass Spectral Language,"Hongchao,Ran,Qinliang,Meifeng,Yaqing,Jianbin,Hongchao,Ran,Qinliang,Meifeng,Yaqing,Jianbin,Hongchao,Ran,Qinliang,Meifeng,Yaqing,Jianbin","Untargeted analysis using liquid chromatography‒mass spectrometry (LC-MS) allows quantification of known and unknown compounds within biological systems. However, in practical analysis of complex biological system, the majority of compounds often remain unidentified. Here, we developed a novel deep learning-based compound annotation approach via semantic similarity analysis of mass spectral language. This approach enables the prediction of structurally related compounds for unknowns. By considering the chemical space, these structurally related compounds provide valuable information about the potential location of the unknown compounds and assist in ranking candidates obtained from molecular structure databases. Validated with two independent benchmark datasets obtained by chemical standards, our method has consistently demonstrated superior performance compared to existing compound annotation methods. A case study of the tomato ripening process indicates that DeepMASS has significant potential for metabolic biomarker identification in real biological systems. Overall, the presented method shows considerable promise in annotating metabolites, particularly in revealing the ""dark matter"" in untargeted analysis."
Improved gene regulatory network inference from single cell data with dropout augmentation,"Hao,Donna,Hao,Donna,Hao,Donna","A major challenge in working with single-cell RNA sequencing data is the prevalence of ""dropout"", when some transcripts' expression values are erroneously not captured. Addressing this issue, which produces zero-inflated count data, is crucial for many downstream data analyses including the inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). In this paper, we introduce two novel contributions. First, we propose Dropout Augmentation (DA), a simple but effective model regularization method to address the zero inflation problem in single-cell data by augmenting the data with synthetic dropout events. DA offers a new perspective to solve the ""dropout"" problem beyond imputation. Second, we present DAZZLE, a stabilized and robust version of the autoencoder-based structure equation model for GRN inference using the DA concept. Benchmark experiments illustrate the improved performance and increased stability of the proposed DAZZLE model over existing approaches. The practical application of the DAZZLE model on a longitudinal mouse microglia dataset containing over 15,000 genes illustrates its ability to handle real-world single cell data with minimal gene filtration. The improved robustness and stability of DAZZLE make it a practical and valuable addition to the toolkit for GRN inference from single-cell data. Finally, we propose that Dropout Augmentation may have wider applications beyond the GRN-inference problem.  Project website: https://bcb.cs.tufts.edu/DAZZLE."
Telomere-to-Telomere Phased Genome Assembly Using HERRO-Corrected Simplex Nanopore Reads,"Dominik,Dehui,Sergey,Paola,Mile,Dominik,Dehui,Sergey,Paola,Mile,Dominik,Dehui,Sergey,Paola,Mile","Telomere-to-telomere phased assemblies have become the norm in genomics. To achieve these for diploid and even polyploid genomes, the contemporary approach involves a combination of two long-read sequencing technologies: high-accuracy long reads, e.g. Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi or Oxford Nanopore (ONT) 'Duplex' reads, and ultra-long ONT 'Simplex' reads. Using two different technologies increases the cost and the required amount of genomic DNA. Here, we show that comparable results are possible using error correction of ultra-long ONT Simplex reads and then assembling them using state-of-the-art de novo assembly methods. To achieve this, we have developed the deep learning-based HERRO framework, which corrects ONT Simplex reads while carefully preserving differences in related genomic sequences. Taking into account informative positions that differentiate the haplotypes or genomic repeat copies, HERRO achieves an increase of read accuracy of up to 100-fold for diploid human genomes. By combining HERRO with Verkko assembler, we achieve high contiguity on several human genomes by reconstructing many chromosomes telomere-to-telomere, including chromosomes X and Y. HERRO supports both R9.4.1 and R10.4.1 ONT Simplex reads and generalizes well to other species. These results provide an opportunity to reduce the cost of genome sequencing and use corrected ONT reads to analyze more complex genomes with different levels of ploidy or even aneuploidy."
Generalizability of Normative Models of Brain Morphometry Across Distinct Ethnoracial Groups,"Ruiyang,Yuetong,Faye,Shalaila S.,Nicole,Kevin,Julian Camillo Becerra,Guoyuan,Jia-Hong,Kiyotaka,Masaki,Junya,Ryota,Neda,Paul M.,Sophia,Ruiyang,Yuetong,Faye,Shalaila S.,Nicole,Kevin,Julian Camillo Becerra,Guoyuan,Jia-Hong,Kiyotaka,Masaki,Junya,Ryota,Neda,Paul M.,Sophia,Ruiyang,Yuetong,Faye,Shalaila S.,Nicole,Kevin,Julian Camillo Becerra,Guoyuan,Jia-Hong,Kiyotaka,Masaki,Junya,Ryota,Neda,Paul M.,Sophia","Normative modeling of brain morphometric data can inform about the clinical significance of deviations from typical patterns in brain structure. Their usefulness, however, is dependent on their applicability to diverse ethnoracial groups. With this in mind, we developed age- and sex-specific normative models for cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical volumes using brain scans from 37,407 healthy individuals from a diverse international sample. Here we demonstrate the validity of these models in diverse and distinct populations. Specifically, we tested these pre-trained models on independent samples of healthy individuals that either self-identified as Black, South Asian, East Asian Chinese, East Asian Japanese, or we categorized as African, Admixed American, East Asian, and European based on their genetic ancestry. Regardless of ethnoracial definition, the performance of the pretrained models in these samples was exceptionally high; the relative mean absolute error for each regional brain morphometry measure was less than 10% across all the distinct ethnoracial groups. These findings affirm the broad applicability of our models, ensuring that brain morphometry assessments using these models are accurate and reliable for individuals regardless of background. This broad applicability has significant implications for advancing personalized medicine and improving health outcomes in diverse populations."
CRISPR-GPT: An LLM Agent for Automated Design of Gene-Editing Experiments,"Yuanhao,Kaixuan,Henry,William Arthur,Di,Mihir Mukesh,Denny,Russ B,Mengdi,Le,Yuanhao,Kaixuan,Henry,William Arthur,Di,Mihir Mukesh,Denny,Russ B,Mengdi,Le,Yuanhao,Kaixuan,Henry,William Arthur,Di,Mihir Mukesh,Denny,Russ B,Mengdi,Le","The introduction of genome engineering technology has transformed biomedical research, making it possible to make precise changes to genetic information. However, creating an efficient gene-editing system requires a deep understanding of CRISPR technology, and the complex experimental systems under investigation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, they often lack specific knowledge and struggle to accurately solve biological design problems. In this work, we introduce CRISPR-GPT, an LLM agent augmented with domain knowledge and external tools to automate and enhance the design process of CRISPR-based gene-editing experiments. CRISPR-GPT leverages the reasoning ability of LLMs to facilitate the process of selecting CRISPR systems, designing guide RNAs, recommending cellular delivery methods, drafting protocols, and designing validation experiments to confirm editing outcomes. We showcase the potential of CRISPR-GPT for assisting non-expert researchers with gene-editing experiments from scratch and validate the agent's effectiveness in a real-world use case. Furthermore, we explore the ethical and regulatory considerations associated with automated gene-editing design, highlighting the need for responsible and transparent use of these tools. Our work aims to bridge the gap between biological researchers across various fields with CRISPR genome engineering technology and demonstrate the potential of LLM agents in facilitating complex biological discovery tasks."
The mechanical and sensory signature of plant-based and animal meat,"Skyler R.,Ethan C,Divya,Magaly C,Archer M,Reese,Yanav,Maria Parra,Valerie Ann Perez,Kevin,Marc Elliot,Ellen,Skyler R.,Ethan C,Divya,Magaly C,Archer M,Reese,Yanav,Maria Parra,Valerie Ann Perez,Kevin,Marc Elliot,Ellen,Skyler R.,Ethan C,Divya,Magaly C,Archer M,Reese,Yanav,Maria Parra,Valerie Ann Perez,Kevin,Marc Elliot,Ellen","Eating less meat is associated with a healthier body and planet. Yet, we remain reluctant to switch to a plant-based diet, largely due to the sensory experience of plant-based meat. Food scientists characterize meat using a double compression test, which only probes one-dimensional behavior. Here we use tension, compression, and shear tests--combined with constitutive neural networks--to automatically discover the behavior of eight plant-based and animal meats across the entire three-dimensional spectrum. We find that plant-based sausage and hotdog, with stiffnesses of 95.9±14.1kPa and 38.7±3.0kPa, successfully mimic their animal counterparts, with 63.5±45.7kPa and 44.3±13.2 kPa, while tofurky is twice as stiff, and tofu is twice as soft. Strikingly, a complementary food tasting survey produces in nearly identical stiffness rankings for all eight products (ρ=0.833, p=0.015). Probing the fully three-dimensional signature of meats is critical to understand subtle differences in texture that may result in a different perception of taste."
Toxicokinetics for organ-on-chip devices,"Nathaniel G.,Richard A.,Dmitry A.,Lisa J.,M. Shane,Nathaniel G.,Richard A.,Dmitry A.,Lisa J.,M. Shane,Nathaniel G.,Richard A.,Dmitry A.,Lisa J.,M. Shane","Organ-on-chip (OOC) devices are an emerging New Approach Method in both pharmacology and toxicology. Such devices use heterotypic combinations of human cells in a micro-fabricated device to mimic , conditions and better predict organ-specific toxicological responses in humans. One drawback of these devices is that they are typically made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a polymer known to interact with hydrophobic chemicals. Due to this interaction, the actual dose experienced by cells inside OOC devices can differ strongly from the nominal dose. To account for these effects, we have developed a comprehensive toxicokinetic approach to measure and model chemical-PDMS interactions, including partitioning into and diffusion through PDMS. We use these methods to characterize PDMS interactions for ten chemicals, ranging from fluorescent dyes to persistent organic pollutants to organophosphate pesticides. We further show that these methods return physical interaction parameters that can be used to accurately predict time-dependent doses under continuous-flow conditions, as would be present in an OOC device. These results demonstrate the validity of the methods and model across geometries and flow rates."

Colorimetric detection methods of pH-sensing wound dressing for point-of-care wound diagnostics,"Katia,Farnoush,Katerina,Aylin,Simon,Katia,Farnoush,Katerina,Aylin,Simon,Katia,Farnoush,Katerina,Aylin,Simon","Chronic lower extremity wounds like diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a major complication of diabetes and the leading cause of lower limb amputations worldwide. Currently, DFUs are diagnosed through macroscopic evaluation, and molecular diagnostics are lacking for the disease staging, treatment selection, and evaluation of treatment success. There is a need for new diagnostic technologies combined with detection methods for point-of-care use. Preclinical and clinical data support the importance of wound pH as a biomarker in chronic wound healing, with DFUs typically exhibiting more alkaline pH values when compared to normal healing wounds. In a previous study, we developed a pH-sensing fluorescent bandage based on pyranine-loaded microparticles that were physically immobilized in an alginate hydrogel. Here, we present a second-generation pH-sensing bandage for colorimetric wound diagnostics. Pyranine was adsorbed at high concentrations onto microparticles to enable colorimetric signal detection. This approach leverages pyranine's ability to change color in response to pH variations through proton exchange properties with the wound fluid. The colorimetric properties of our bandage enable signal detection by two methods suited for point-of-care use: a smartphone camera and a cost-effective homebuilt RGB detector. Analyzing the color intensity of the bandage with Red, Green and Blue absorbance values, it is possible to correlate the RGB absorbance to a pH value in the clinically-relevant range to 6.0 to 9.0 in vitro and ex vivo, as the B values decreased with the increase in pH levels, as associated with DFUs. These findings indicate the potential of colorimetric detection using smartphone cameras or home-built absorbance detectors for rapid wound diagnostics at the point-of-care."

Multilevel irreversibility reveals higher-order organisation of non-equilibrium interactions in human brain dynamics,"Ramón,Leonardo,Gemma,Peter,Gustavo,Morten L.,Renaud,Alain,Ramón,Leonardo,Gemma,Peter,Gustavo,Morten L.,Renaud,Alain,Ramón,Leonardo,Gemma,Peter,Gustavo,Morten L.,Renaud,Alain","Information processing in the human brain can be modelled as a complex dynamical system operating out of equilibrium with multiple regions interacting nonlinearly. Yet, despite extensive study of the global level of non-equilibrium in the brain, quantifying the irreversibility of interactions among brain regions at multiple levels remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we present the Directed Multiplex Visibility Graph Irreversibility framework, a method for analysing neural recordings using network analysis of time-series. Our approach constructs directed multi-layer graphs from multivariate time-series where information about irreversibility can be decoded from the marginal degree distributions across the layers, which each represents a variable. This framework is able to quantify the irreversibility of every interaction in the complex system. Applying the method to magnetoencephalography recordings during a long-term memory recognition task, we quantify the multivariate irreversibility of interactions between brain regions and identify the combinations of regions which showed higher levels of non-equilibrium in their interactions. For individual regions, we find higher irreversibility in cognitive versus sensorial brain regions whilst for pairs, strong relationships are uncovered between cognitive and sensorial pairs in the same hemisphere. For triplets and quadruplets, the most non-equilibrium interactions are between cognitive-sensorial pairs alongside medial regions. Finally, for quintuplets, our analysis finds higher irreversibility when the prefrontal cortex is included in the interaction. Combining these results, we show that multilevel irreversibility offers unique insights into the higher-order, hierarchical organisation of neural dynamics and presents a new perspective on the analysis of brain network dynamics."
"Analysis of the dynamics of a complex, multipathway reaction: Insulin dimer dissociation","Kwanghoon,Spencer C.,Sammy,Aaron R.,Kwanghoon,Spencer C.,Sammy,Aaron R.,Kwanghoon,Spencer C.,Sammy,Aaron R.","The protein hormone insulin forms a homodimer that must dissociate to bind to its receptor. Understanding the kinetics and mechanism of dissociation is essential for rational design of therapeutic analogs. In addition to its physiological importance, this dissociation process serves as a paradigm for coupled (un)folding and (un)binding. Based on previous free energy simulations, insulin dissociation is thought to involve multiple pathways with comparable free energy barriers. Here, we analyze the mechanism of insulin dimer dissociation using a recently developed computational framework for estimating kinetic statistics from short-trajectory data. These statistics indicate that the likelihood of dissociation (the committor) closely tracks the decrease in the number of (native and nonnative) intermonomer contacts and the increase in the number of water contacts at the dimer interface; the transition state with equal likelihood of association and dissociation corresponds to an encounter complex with relatively few native contacts and many nonnative contacts. We identify four pathways out of the dimer state and quantify their contributions to the rate, as well as their exchange, by computing reactive fluxes. We show that both the pathways and their extents of exchange can be understood in terms of rotations around three axes of the dimer structure. Our results provide insights into the kinetics of insulin analogues and, more generally, how to characterize complex, multipathway processes."
Compositional editing of extracellular matrices by CRISPR/Cas9 engineering of human mesenchymal stem cell lines,"Sujeethkumar,Alejandro Garcia,Karin,Bai,Sonia,Ludvig Nilsén,Agatheeswaran,Sofie,David,Steven J,Dimitra,Deepak Bushan,Paul E,Sujeethkumar,Alejandro Garcia,Karin,Bai,Sonia,Ludvig Nilsén,Agatheeswaran,Sofie,David,Steven J,Dimitra,Deepak Bushan,Paul E,Sujeethkumar,Alejandro Garcia,Karin,Bai,Sonia,Ludvig Nilsén,Agatheeswaran,Sofie,David,Steven J,Dimitra,Deepak Bushan,Paul E","Tissue engineering strategies predominantly rely on the production of living substitutes, whereby implanted cells actively participate in the regenerative process. Beyond cost and delayed graft availability, the patient-specific performance of engineered tissues poses serious concerns on their clinical translation ability. A more exciting paradigm consists in exploiting cell-laid, engineered extracellular matrices (eECM), which can be used as off-the-shelf materials. Here, the regenerative capacity solely relies on the preservation of the eECM structure and embedded signals to instruct an endogenous repair. We recently described the possibility to exploit custom human stem cell lines for eECM manufacturing. In addition to the conferred standardization, the availability of such cell lines opened avenues for the design of tailored eECMs by applying dedicated genetic tools. In this study, we demonstrated the exploitation of CRISPR/Cas9 as a high precision system for editing the composition and function of eECMs. Human mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (hMSC) lines were modified to knockout VEGF and RUNX2 and assessed for their capacity to generate osteoinductive cartilage matrices. We report the successful editing of hMSCs, subsequently leading to targeted VEGF and RUNX2-knockout cartilage eECMs. Despite the absence of VEGF, eECMs retained full capacity to instruct ectopic endochondral ossification. Conversely, RUNX2-edited eECMs exhibited impaired hypertrophy, reduced ectopic ossification and superior cartilage repair in a rat osteochondral defect. In summary, our approach can be harnessed to identify the necessary eECM factors driving endogenous repair. Our work paves the road towards the compositional eECMs editing and their exploitation in broad regenerative contexts."
Bilateral cellular flows display asymmetry prior to left-right organizer formation in amniote gastrulation,"Rieko,Shubham,Vivek N,Takashi,Rieko,Shubham,Vivek N,Takashi,Rieko,Shubham,Vivek N,Takashi","A bilateral body plan is predominant throughout the animal kingdom. Bilaterality of amniote embryos becomes recognizable as midline morphogenesis begins at gastrulation, bisecting an embryonic field into the left and right sides, and left-right asymmetry patterning follows. While a series of laterality genes expressed after the left-right compartmentalization has been extensively studied, the laterality patterning prior to and during midline morphogenesis has remained unclear. Here, through a biophysical quantification in a high spatial and temporal resolution, applied to a chick model system, we show that a large-scale bilateral counter-rotating cellular flow, termed as polonaise movements, display left-right asymmetries in early gastrulation. This cell movement starts prior to the formation of the primitive streak, which is the earliest midline structure, and earlier than expression of laterality genes. The cellular flow speed and vorticity unravel the location and timing of the left-right asymmetries. The bilateral flows displayed a Right dominance after six hours since the start of cell movements. Mitotic arrest that diminishes primitive streak formation resulted in changes in the bilateral flow pattern, but the Right dominance persisted. Our data indicate that the left-right asymmetry in amniote gastrula becomes detectable prior to the point when the asymmetric regulation of the laterality signals at the node leads to the left-right patterning. More broadly, our results suggest that physical processes can play an unexpected but significant role in influencing left-right laterality during embryonic development."

The cell surface is a complex structure that consists of a thin, contractile cortical actin network tethered to the plasma membrane by specialized membrane-to-cortex attachment (MCA) proteins. This active and constantly fluctuating system maintains a delicate mechanochemical state which permits spontaneous polarization and shape change when needed. Combining in silico, in vitro, and in vivo experiments we show how membrane viscosity and MCA protein length regulate cortical dynamics. We reveal a novel mechanism whereby caging of linker proteins in the actin cortex allows for the amplification of small changes in these key parameters, leading to major alterations of cortical contractility. In cells, this mechanism alone gives rise to symmetry breaking phenomena, suggesting that local changes in lipid composition, in combination with the choice of MCA proteins, contribute to the regulation of cellular morphogenesis and function."

Understanding how the irreversible kinetics (i.e., the arrow of time) of biological systems emerge from the equilibrium kinetics of constituent structures defined on smaller thermal scales is central to describing biological function. Muscle’s irreversible power stroke – with its mechanochemistry defined on both the thermal scale of muscle and the thermal scale of myosin motors – provides a clear solution to this problem."

"Visualizing nucleation, condensation and propagation of β-tubulin folding in chaperonin TRiC","Yanyan,Michael F.,Wah,Yanyan,Michael F.,Wah,Yanyan,Michael F.,Wah","The folding nucleus (FN) initiates protein folding and enables an efficient folding pathway. Here we directly visualize the tubulin FN consisting of a nonnative, partially assembled Rossmann fold, in the closed chamber of human chaperonin TRiC. Chaperonin TRiC interacts with non-natively folded secondary structural elements, stabilizing the nucleus for transition into its first native domain. Through progressive folding, the unfolded sequence goes through drastic spatial arrangement in the TRiC chamber to sample the conformational space, mediated by the highly dynamic CCT tails. The observed presence of individual nonnative secondary structures first in the nonnative FN and then around the incrementally folded native domains supports the hypothesis that tubulin folding in TRiC is a hierarchical process of nucleation, condensation and propagation in cooperation with TRiC subunits."
Defining the alpha domain of K1-like killer toxins,"Sarah A.,F. Marty,Paul A.,Sarah A.,F. Marty,Paul A.,Sarah A.,F. Marty,Paul A.","Antifungal killer toxins produced by yeasts undergo post-translational processing to enable the formation of mature and active toxins. The preprocessed, immature K1 killer toxin from , has four different domains (delta, alpha, gamma, and beta) that are cleaved to produce a mature toxin consisting of a disulfide-linked alpha and beta heterodimer. K1 homologs from various yeast species of the Saccharomycotina have been previously identified by primary sequence homology. Primary sequence analysis has identified putative cleavage sites across all homologs, with some conservation with cleavage sites identified in K1 and the likely importance of the conserved carboxypeptidases Kex1 and Kex2. The identification of sites of proteolytic processing has enabled an accurate definition of the domain boundaries of delta, alpha, gamma, and beta domains in all K1 homologs. Functional assays revealed that many K1 homologs contain cytotoxic alpha domains. Interestingly, several killer toxins that lacked measurable antifungal activity still exhibited toxic alpha domains when expressed independently. These findings suggest that alpha domain toxicity is conserved across K1 homologs, and that variations in post-translational processing and domain interactions may influence full-length toxin functionality. This work provides insights into the evolutionary conservation and diversity of yeast killer toxins."
Cefepime-Taniborbactam and Ceftibuten-Ledaborbactam Maintain Activity Against KPC Variants that Lead to Ceftazidime-Avibactam Resistance,"Cullen L.,Annie,Brittany,Denis M.,Tsuyoshi,Daniel C.,Cullen L.,Annie,Brittany,Denis M.,Tsuyoshi,Daniel C.,Cullen L.,Annie,Brittany,Denis M.,Tsuyoshi,Daniel C."," carbapenemases (KPCs) are widespread β-lactamases that are a major cause of clinical non-susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria to carbapenems and other β-lactam antibiotics. Ceftazidime combined with the β-lactamase inhibitor avibactam (CAZ-AVI) has been effective for treating infections by KPC-producing bacteria, but emergent KPC variants confer resistance to the combination. Taniborbactam and ledaborbactam are bicyclic boronate β-lactamase inhibitors under development with cefepime and ceftibuten, respectively, to treat carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections. Here, we assessed the effects of clinically important KPC-2 and KPC-3 variants (V240G, D179Y, D179Y T243M) on the antibacterial activity of cefepime-taniborbactam (FEP-TAN) and ceftibuten-ledaborbactam (CTB-LED) and examined catalytic activity and inhibition of these variants. FEP-TAN and CTB-LED were highly active against CAZ-AVI-resistant engineered , strains expressing these variants. Purified KPC variants catalyzed more efficient CAZ hydrolysis than wild-type enzymes, and D179Y-containing KPC-3 variants additionally catalyzed more efficient FEP hydrolysis than wild-type KPC-3. All KPC variants poorly hydrolyzed CTB, and D179Y-containing variants demonstrated significantly higher affinity for CAZ than FEP or CTB. Second-order rate constants (,/,) for inhibition of D179Y-containing KPC-2 variants were significantly reduced relative to wild-type KPC-2, with AVI most impacted. ,/, was less affected for D179Y-containing KPC-3 variants, and reflected robust inhibition by TAN, LED and AVI. Together, the findings illustrate a biochemical basis for greater FEP-TAN and CTB-LED antibacterial activity in KPC variant expression backgrounds relative to CAZ-AVI, whereby the boronate inhibitors have sufficient inhibitory activity, whilst FEP and CTB are poorer substrates and bind to the variant enzymes with reduced affinity compared to CAZ."
Phosphoproteomics highlights complex resource management upon inflammatory stimulation of fibroblasts,"Patricia,Ana,Gerhard,Lukas,Jesper V.,Christopher,Patricia,Ana,Gerhard,Lukas,Jesper V.,Christopher,Patricia,Ana,Gerhard,Lukas,Jesper V.,Christopher","The stimulation of cells by inflammatory mediators gives rise to intricate signaling cascades, inducing specific biological functions. The role of kinase activation for the establishment of specific inflammatory functions has only scarcely been established. A time-course analysis of human fetal fibroblasts stimulated with Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and/or Dexamethasone (Dex) was conducted using mass spectrometry-based proteomics and phosphoproteomics in conjunction with lysolipid and oxylipin profiling. The IL-1β induced proteome alterations indicated metabolic, transcriptional, and translational activation, including inflammatory marker proteins such as NOS1, THBS1, and STING1. The induction of mitochondrial proteins and the formation of numerous lysolipids indicated an increase in beta-oxidation. In addition to the NF-κB and STAT signaling pathways, which are characteristic of inflammatory activation, the MAP and AKT kinase signaling pathways were found to be strongly induced. Six hours after treatment, the observed signaling events exhibited a notable decline, nearly returning to their initial states after 24 hours. It is noteworthy that nearly all of these signaling activities were also observed in cells treated with Dex alone. Additionally, the proteome exhibited transient alterations, which included proteins otherwise characteristic of an inflammatory response, such as MMP3 and NFKB2. Activation of the kinase PIKFYVE was apparently specific for dexamethasone but constituted a minority of the total phosphorylation events. Only after 24 hours was the induction of proteins characteristic of glucocorticoids, such as TSC22D3 and MAOA, observed. The analysis of the effects of dexamethasone on the background of established inflammatory signaling verified the known inhibitory functions and resulted in the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins and oxylipins, but hardly affected the signaling events involving MAP and AKT kinases. In conclusion, this data demonstrates that a majority of inflammation-associated signaling events in fibroblasts needs to be attributed to resource and stress management rather than the establishment of specific inflammatory effector functions."

Here we show that RFdiffusion can be conditioned to efficiently generate protein scaffolds that form geometrically matched extended beta-sheets with target protein edge beta-strands in which polar groups on the target are nearly perfectly complemented with hydrogen bonding groups on the design. We use this approach to design binders against a set of therapeutically relevant polar targets (KIT, PDGFRɑ, ALK-2, ALK-3, FCRL5, and NRP1) and find that beta-strand-targeted design yields higher affinities and success rates than unconditioned RFdiffusion. All by all binding experiments show that the designs have affinities ranging from 76 pM to mid nM for their targets and essentially no off target binding despite the sharing of beta-strand interactions, likely reflecting the precise customization of interacting beta-strand geometry and additional designed binder-target interactions. A co-crystal structure of one such design in complex with the KIT receptor is nearly identical to the computational design model confirming the accuracy of the design approach. The ability to robustly generate binders displaying high affinity and specificity to polar interaction surfaces with exposed beta-strands considerably increases the range and capabilities of computational binder design."

QT45 can synthesize both its complementary strand from a mix of all 64 trinucleotides and a copy of itself using 13 defined trinucleotides and one hexamer as substrates. The discovery of this complex activity in a small ribozyme suggests that polymerase ribozymes may be more abundant in RNA sequence space than anticipated, thereby facilitating the emergence of self-replication."
Bond-centric modular design of protein assemblies,"Shunzhi,Andrew,Ryan,Joshua,Andrew J.,Nicolas,Rachel L.,Huat Thart,William,Yang,Zhe,Damian C.,Gira,Lilo D,David,Shunzhi,Andrew,Ryan,Joshua,Andrew J.,Nicolas,Rachel L.,Huat Thart,William,Yang,Zhe,Damian C.,Gira,Lilo D,David,Shunzhi,Andrew,Ryan,Joshua,Andrew J.,Nicolas,Rachel L.,Huat Thart,William,Yang,Zhe,Damian C.,Gira,Lilo D,David","We describe a modular bond-centric approach to protein nanomaterial design inspired by the rich diversity of chemical structures that can be generated from the small number of atomic valencies and bonding interactions. We design protein building blocks with regular coordination geometries and bonding interactions that enable the assembly of a wide variety of closed and opened nanomaterials using simple geometrical principles. Experimental characterization confirms successful formation of more than twenty multi-component polyhedral protein cages, 2D arrays, and 3D protein lattices, with a high (10-50 %) success rate and electron microscopy data closely matching the corresponding design models. Because of the modularity, individual building blocks can assemble with different partners to generate distinct regular assemblies, resulting in an economy of parts and enabling the construction of reconfigurable systems."

"A versatile protocol for purifying recombinant proteins from , for structural studies","Aaron W.,Arthur,Ulla,Monika,Jijie,Elmar,Paul,Aaron W.,Arthur,Ulla,Monika,Jijie,Elmar,Paul,Aaron W.,Arthur,Ulla,Monika,Jijie,Elmar,Paul","Structural biology is an essential tool for understanding the molecular basis of biological processes. Although predicting protein structures by fold recognition algorithms has become increasingly powerful, especially with the integration of deep-learning approaches, experimentally resolved structures are indispensable for guiding structure-function studies and for improving modelling. However, experimental structural studies of protein complexes are still challenging, owing to, for example, the necessity for high protein concentrations and purity for downstream analyses such as cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The use of , leaves as a transient expression system for recombinant proteins has become an increasingly attractive approach as the plant is inexpensive to cultivate, grows rapidly, allows fast experimental turnaround and is easily scalable compared to other established systems such as insect cell cultures. Using , as an expression system, we present here a robust and versatile protocol for the purification of five heterocomplexes with sizes ranging from ∼140 kDa to ∼660 kDa consisting of immunoreceptors and their associated pathogen effectors, followed by electron microscopy. The plant-based protocol was applied to verify the structure of the insect cell-derived wheat Sr35 resistosome and to co-purify and co-resolve a ∼140 kDa homodimer of the AvrSr35 effector from the fungus , f sp , (,). In several cases, only a single epitope tag is needed for complex purification, reducing complications that come with multiple epitope tags and two-step affinity purifications. We identify codon usage, signal peptide fusion, epitope tag choice and detergents as critical factors for expression and purification of recombinant protein from , leaves."
Energy-based Analysis of Biochemical Oscillators Using Bond Graphs and Linear Control Theory.,"Peter,Michael,Peter,Michael,Peter,Michael","The bond graph approach has been recognised as a useful conceptual basis for understanding the behaviour of living entities modelled as a system with hierarchical interacting parts exchanging energy. One such behaviour is oscillation, which underpins many essential biological
functions. In this paper, energy-based modelling of biochemical systems using the bond graph approach is combined with classical feedback control theory to give a novel approach to the analysis, and potentially synthesis, of biochemical oscillators. It is shown that oscillation is dependent on the interplay between active and passive feedback and this interplay is formalised using classical frequency-response analysis of feedback systems. In particular, the phase margin  is suggested as a simple scalar indicator of the presence or absence of oscillations; it is shown how this indicator can be used to investigate the effect of both the structure and parameters of biochemical system on oscillation. It follows that the combination of classical feedback control theory and the bond graph approach to systems biology gives a novel analysis and design methodology for biochemical oscillators. The approach is illustrated using an introductory example similar to the Goodwin oscillator, the Sel'kov model of Glycolytic Oscillations and the Repressilator."
SOX10 and microRNAs: decoding their interplay in regulating melanoma plasticity,"Xin,Chunyan,Zhesi,Anja,Markus V.,Carola,Julio,Xin,Chunyan,Zhesi,Anja,Markus V.,Carola,Julio,Xin,Chunyan,Zhesi,Anja,Markus V.,Carola,Julio","Recent studies show that the dysregulation of the transcription factor SOX10 is essential for development and progression of melanoma. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can regulate the expression of transcription factors at the post-transcriptional level. The interactions between SOX10 and its targeting miRNAs form network motifs such as feedforward and feedback loops. Such motifs can result in non-linear dynamics in gene expression levels, therefore playing a crucial role in regulating tumor proliferation and metastasis as well as tumor’s responses to therapies. Here, we reviewed and discussed the intricate interplay between SOX10 and miRNAs in melanoma biology including melanogenesis, phenotype switch, and therapy resistance. Additionally, we investigated the gene regulatory interactions in melanoma, identifying crucial network motifs that involve both SOX10 and miRNAs. We also analyzed the expression levels of the components within these motifs. From a control theory perspective, we explained how these dynamics are linked to the phenotypic plasticity of melanoma cells. In summary, we underscored the importance of employing a data-driven network biology approach to elucidate the complex regulatory mechanisms and identify driver network motifs within the melanoma network. This methodology facilitates a deeper understanding of the regulation of SOX10 by miRNAs in melanoma. The insight gained could potentially contribute to the development of miRNA-based treatments for SOX10, thereby enhancing the clinical management of this malignancy."

A global resource constrained model to predict metabolic flux dynamics in fluctuating environments,"Huili,Yang,Xiongfei,Huili,Yang,Xiongfei,Huili,Yang,Xiongfei","Environmental changes often induce global variations on bacterial gene expression, frequently accompanied by alterations in growth rates. Integrating non-metabolic cellular processes, such as gene expression and macromolecule synthesis, with metabolic modeling remains a significant challenge in systems biology due to the lack of mechanistic representation of gene regulation. Here, we introduce a novel constraint-based modeling framework called dynamic Constrained Allocation Flux Balance Analysis (dCAFBA), which comprehensively integrates metabolism, cellular resource allocation, and gene regulation. We employ a quasi-steady-state assumption, positing that reaction fluxes achieve balance at each time step, adapting more rapidly than protein synthesis and growth dilution. This approach enables the prediction of reaction flux dynamics and protein allocation necessary to achieve cellular objectives, such as optimizing growth during various growth shifts (including carbon, amino acid, and transcriptional signal), without detailing molecular gene regulations. Our model offers a new method for interpreting proteome allocation and cellular metabolism in complex and transient environments, providing mechanistic insights valuable for metabolic engineering."

The goal of this analysis is to determine which approaches (including groups of focus, research methods, and settings/perspectives) from social science fields (i.e., psychology, sociology, and anthropology) are utilized in published peer-reviewed biology education research relating to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Scoping how social science approaches are used in this area is important to understanding whether biology education research could benefit from complementary approaches that might advance praxis. This analysis found that research informing the biology education community draws heavily from psychological perspectives that are overwhelmingly not disaggregated (78% of articles identifying a group used a lumped together one), are by far more quantitative (58% used survey, 26% grades, 20% school data) than qualitative (17% used interview, 10% observation), and did not (72%) adopt structural approaches. The addition of missing contributions from social science is critical to advancing interventions to broaden STEM participation given that merging paradigms can offer more robust, multi-level explanations for observed phenomena. This has important implications for education, biology education, biology education research, social science, and research in related STEM fields."
Regulation of replication timing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Rosie,Eamonn,Francisco,Michael A,Rosie,Eamonn,Francisco,Michael A,Rosie,Eamonn,Francisco,Michael A","In order to maintain genomic integrity, DNA replication must be highly coordinated. Disruptions in this process can cause replication stress which is aberrant in many pathologies including cancer. Despite this, little is known about the mechanisms governing the temporal regulation of DNA replication initiation, thought to be related to the limited copy number of firing factors. Here, we present a high (1-kilobase) resolution stochastic model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae whole-genome replication in which origins compete to associate with limited firing factors. After developing an algorithm to fit this model to replication timing data, we validated the model by reproducing experimental inter-origin distances, origin efficiencies, and replication fork directionality. This suggests the model accurately simulates the aspects of DNA replication most important for determining its dynamics. We also use the model to predict measures of DNA replication dynamics which are yet to be determined experimentally and investigate the potential impacts of variations in firing factor concentrations on DNA replication."

We show our map of protein complexes is highly accurate and more comprehensive than previous maps, placing ~75% of human proteins into their physical contexts. We globally characterize our complexes using protein co-variation data (ProteomeHD.2) and identify co-varying complexes suggesting common functional associations. Our map also generates testable functional hypotheses for 472 uncharacterized proteins which we support using AlphaFold modeling. Additionally, we use AlphaFold modeling to identify 511 mutually exclusive protein pairs in hu.MAP3.0 complexes suggesting complexes serve different functional roles depending on their subunit composition. We identify expression as the primary way cells and organisms relieve the conflict of mutually exclusive subunits. Finally, we import our complexes to EMBL-EBI's Complex Portal (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal/home) as well as provide complexes through our hu.MAP3.0 web interface (https://humap3.proteincomplexes.org/).

Constructing a Norm for Children’s Scientific Drawing: Distribution Features Based on Semantic Similarity of Large Language Models,"Yi,Fan,Yan,Yanyan,Jianli,Zipo,Xinyu,Wei,Peng,Jingyi,Zhong,Yi,Fan,Yan,Yanyan,Jianli,Zipo,Xinyu,Wei,Peng,Jingyi,Zhong,Yi,Fan,Yan,Yanyan,Jianli,Zipo,Xinyu,Wei,Peng,Jingyi,Zhong","Using children’s drawings to understand children’s concept learning has been proven to be an effective method, but there are still two major problems in previous research: 1. The drawings heavily relies on the task, so the ecological validity of the conclusions is low; 2. The subjective interpretation of drawings is inevitable. To address these problems, this study uses the Large Language Model (LLM) to identify the drawing contents of 1096 children’s scientific drawings (covering 6 scientific concepts), and uses the word2vec algorithm to calculate their semantic similarity. The study explores whether there are consistent drawing representations among children with the same theme, and attempts to establish a norm for children’s scientific drawings, providing a baseline reference for following children’s drawing research. The results showed that there were significant differences in the consistency of children’s representations of different concepts, and there was a possibility of consistency bias, that is, the appearance of consistency representations misled LLM. At the same time, linear regression tests were used to analyze the relevant factors that affect children’s representation. The results show that sample size and teaching strategies can affect the accuracy of LLM’s image recognition, while the degree of conceptual abstraction may affect the consistency of representation."
Probing visual literacy skills reveals student conceptions of scale and abstraction with respect to chromosomes,"Crystal,Dina L.,L. Kate,Crystal,Dina L.,L. Kate,Crystal,Dina L.,L. Kate","Molecular biology can be difficult for undergraduate students because course content is often taught using highly-abstract visual representations. Genetic concepts can be depicted with lines, letters, shapes, and symbols, and students need to engage their visual literacy skills to appropriately decipher these abstract representations. We previously found that undergraduate course materials almost always represent chromosomes in abstract forms, such as “X” shapes or straight lines with a dot for the centromere. We hypothesized that students struggle to apply their visual literacy skills to accurately interpret these abstract representations of chromosomes, which may be related to the frequently-documented incomplete or incorrect ideas students have about chromosome structure and function. To explore students’ visual literacy related to representations of chromosomes, we conducted 35 semi-structured interviews with students who had taken at least a year of biology courses. We asked them to sketch chromosomes, interpret an abstract representation of chromosomes, and use the abstract representation to answer a question about meiosis. We found that 97% of participants (34 of 35) held conceptual errors related to chromosome structure and function. These conceptual errors were often not evident in participants’ verbal definitions of chromosomes and were only revealed in their sketches or explanations of their sketches. We found that participants frequently misinterpreted X-shaped representations of chromosomes, mistook unreplicated homologous chromosomes as separated sister chromatids, and held misconceptions related to the structure and function of centromeres. These findings have implications for how chromosomes are taught in biology courses. We recommend that instructors explicitly discuss the conventions and norms of representing chromosomes as a pathway for increasing students’ visual literacy in molecular biology."
The permutation analysis prior to variable selection greatly enhances robustness of OPLS analysis in small cohorts,"Marika,Nicole,Iryna,Åsa M,Marika,Nicole,Iryna,Åsa M,Marika,Nicole,Iryna,Åsa M","The R-workflow roplspvs (R orthogonal projections of latent structures with permutation over variable selection) facilitates variable selection, model optimization and significance testing using permutations of OPLS-DA models, with the scaled loadings (p[corr]) as the main metric of significance cutoff. Permutations including (over) the variable selection procedure, prior to (sans), as well as post variable selection are performed. The resulting p-values for the correlation of the model (R,)and the cross-validated correlation of the model (Q,) sans-, post- and over- variable selection are provided as additional model statistics. These model statistics are useful for determining the true significance level of OPLS models, which otherwise have proven difficult to assess particularly for small sample sizes. Furthermore, we propose a means for estimating the background noise level based on permutated false positive rates of R, and Q,. This novel metric is then utilized to calculate an adjusted Q, value. Using a publicly available metabolomics dataset, the advantage of performing permutations over variable selection was demonstrated for small sample sizes. Iteratively reducing the sample sizes resulted in overinflated models with increasing R, and Q,, and permutations post variable selection indicated falsely significant models. In contrast, the adjusted Q, was marginally affected by sample size, and represents a robust estimate of model predictability, and permutations over variable selection showed true significance of the models."
Large protein databases reveal structural complementarity and functional locality,"Pawel,Lukasz M.,Witold,P. Douglas,Julia,Tomasz,Pawel,Lukasz M.,Witold,P. Douglas,Julia,Tomasz,Pawel,Lukasz M.,Witold,P. Douglas,Julia,Tomasz","Recent breakthroughs in protein structure prediction have led to an unprecedented surge in high-quality 3D models, highlighting the need for efficient computational solutions to manage and analyze this wealth of structural data. In our work, we comprehensively examine the structural clusters obtained from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AFDB), a highquality subset of ESMAtlas, and the Microbiome Immunity Project (MIP). We create a single cohesive low-dimensional representation of the resulting protein space. Our results show that, while each database occupies distinct regions within the protein structure space, they collectively exhibit significant overlap in their functional profiles. High-level biological functions tend to cluster in particular regions, revealing a shared functional landscape despite the diverse sources of data. To facilitate exploration and improve access to our data, we developed an open-access web server. Our findings lay the groundwork for more in-depth studies concerning protein sequence-structure-function relationships, where various biological questions can be asked about taxonomic assignments, environmental factors, or functional specificity."
Predicting the effect of CRISPR-Cas9-based epigenome editing,"Sanjit Singh,Alan,Jeffrey P.,Jacob,Selvalakshmi S.,Isaac,Yun S,Sanjit Singh,Alan,Jeffrey P.,Jacob,Selvalakshmi S.,Isaac,Yun S,Sanjit Singh,Alan,Jeffrey P.,Jacob,Selvalakshmi S.,Isaac,Yun S","Epigenetic regulation orchestrates mammalian transcription, but functional links between them remain elusive. To tackle this problem, we use epigenomic and transcriptomic data from 13 ENCODE cell types to train machine learning models to predict gene expression from histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), achieving transcriptome-wide correlations of ~0.70-0.79 for most cell types. Our models recapitulate known associations between histone PTMs and expression patterns, including predicting that acetylation of histone subunit H3 lysine residue 27 (H3K27ac) near the transcription start site (TSS) significantly increases expression levels. To validate this prediction experimentally and investigate how natural vs. engineered deposition of H3K27ac might differentially affect expression, we apply the synthetic dCas9-p300 histone acetyltransferase system to 8 genes in the HEK293T cell line and to 5 genes in the K562 cell line. Further, to facilitate model building, we perform MNase-seq to map genome-wide nucleosome occupancy levels in HEK293T. We observe that our models perform well in accurately ranking relative fold-changes among genes in response to the dCas9-p300 system; however, their ability to rank fold-changes within individual genes is noticeably diminished compared to predicting expression across cell types from their native epigenetic signatures. Our findings highlight the need for more comprehensive genome-scale epigenome editing datasets, better understanding of the actual modifications made by epigenome editing tools, and improved causal models that transfer better from endogenous cellular measurements to perturbation experiments. Together these improvements would facilitate the ability to understand and predictably control the dynamic human epigenome with consequences for human health."
A uniﬁed framework for drug-target interaction prediction by semantic-guided meta-path method,"Haoyuan,Jianxin,Haochen,Kai,Qichang,Haoyuan,Jianxin,Haochen,Kai,Qichang,Haoyuan,Jianxin,Haochen,Kai,Qichang","Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction plays a crucial role in drug development, impacting areas such as virtual screening, drug repurposing, and the identification of potential drug side effects. Despite significant efforts dedicated to improving DTI prediction, existing methods still struggle with the challenges posed by the high sparsity of DTI datasets and the complexity of capturing heterogeneous information in biological networks.
To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework for DTI prediction based on a semantics-guided meta-path walk. Specifically, we first pre-train drug and protein embeddings to capture their semantic information. This semantic information is then leveraged to guide a meta-path-based random walk on the biological heterogeneous network, generating sequences of interactions. These sequences are used to compute embedding features via a heterogeneous skip-gram model, which are subsequently fed into downstream tasks to predict DTIs.
SGMDTI achieves substantial performance improvement over other state-of-the-art methods for drug-target interaction prediction. Moreover, it excels in the cold-start scenario, which is often a challenging case in DTI prediction. These results indicate the effectiveness of our approach in predicting drug-target interactions.Experimental datasets and experimental codes can be found in https://github.com/HYLPRC/SGMDTI."
Searching for Sulfotyrosines (sY) in a HA(pY)STACK,"Jordan,Claire E,Patrick A,Kerry A,Zhi,Eric W,Andrew R,Jordan,Claire E,Patrick A,Kerry A,Zhi,Eric W,Andrew R,Jordan,Claire E,Patrick A,Kerry A,Zhi,Eric W,Andrew R","Protein sulfation can be crucial in regulating protein-protein interactions but remains largely underexplored. Sulfation is near-isobaric to phosphorylation, making it particularly challenging to investigate using mass spectrometry. The degree to which tyrosine sulfation (sY) is misidentified as phosphorylation (pY) is thus an unresolved concern. This study explores the extent of sY misidentification within the human phosphoproteome by distinguishing between sulfation and phosphorylation based on their mass difference. Using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), we screened ~45M peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) from the PeptideAtlas Human Phosphoproteome build for peptidoforms with mass error shifts indicative of sulfation. This analysis pinpointed 104 candidate sulfated peptidoforms, backed-up by Gene Ontology (GO) terms and custom terms linked to sulfation. False positive filtering by manual annotation resulted in 31 convincing peptidoforms spanning 7 known and 7 novel sY sites. Y47 in Calumenin was particularly intriguing since mass error shifts, acidic motif conservation, and MS2 neutral loss patterns characteristic of sulfation, but not phosphorylation, provided strong evidence that this site can only be sulfated. Overall, although misidentification of sulfation in phosphoproteomics datasets derived from cell and tissue intracellular extracts can occur, it appears relatively rare and should not be considered a confounding factor for high-quality phosphoproteomics studies."

Synthetic cell models have been developed as bionic materials to mimic inherent cellular features such as self-assembly. Here, we leverage co-assembly of synthetic and natural cells to create hybrid living 3D cancer cultures. We screened synthetic cell models, including giant unilamellar vesicles, coacervates, microdroplet emulsions, proteinosomes, and colloidosomes, for their ability to form hybrid tumoroids. Our results identify the balance of inter- and extracellular adhesion and synthetic cell surface tension as key material properties driving successful co-assembly of hybrids. We further demonstrate that these synthetic cells can establish artificial tumor immune microenvironments (ART-TIMEs), mimicking immunogenic signals within tumoroids. Using the ART-TIME approach, we identify co-signaling mechanisms between PD-1 and CD2 as a driver in immune evasion of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Our findings demonstrate the 3D bottom-up self-assembly of hybrid cancer microenvironments to replace immune components with defined bionic materials, pushing the boundaries to functionally integrating living and non-living matter."

We characterized their ability to detect TNT in a natural soil system, measuring single-cell and population-level behavior over a 28-day period. The autonomous microbial sensor activated its response by 14-fold when exposed to low TNT concentrations and maintained stable activation for over 21 days, exhibiting exponential decay dynamics at the population-level with a half-life of about 5 days.

A robust synthetic biology toolkit to advance carboxysome study and redesign,"Daniel S.,Y,Anthony G.,Cesar R.,Daniel S.,Y,Anthony G.,Cesar R.,Daniel S.,Y,Anthony G.,Cesar R.","Carboxysomes are polyhedral protein organelles that microorganisms use to facilitate carbon dioxide assimilation. They are composed of a modular protein shell which envelops an enzymatic core mainly comprised of physically coupled Rubisco and carbonic anhydrase. While the modular construction principles of carboxysomes make them attractive targets as customizable metabolic platforms, their size and complexity can be a hinderance. In this work, we design and validate a plasmid set – the pXpressome toolkit -in which α-carboxysomes are robustly expressed and remain intact and functional after purification. We tested this toolkit by introducing mutations which influence carboxysome structure and performance. We find that deletion of vertex-capping genes results in formation of larger carboxysomes while deletion of facet forming genes produces smaller particles, suggesting that adjusting the ratio of these proteins can rationally affect morphology. Through a series of fluorescently labeled constructs, we observe this toolkit leads to more uniform expression and better cell health than previously published carboxysome expression systems. Overall, the pXpressome toolkit facilitates the study and redesign of carboxysomes with robust performance and improved phenotype uniformity. The pXpressome toolkit will support efforts to remodel carboxysomes for enhanced carbon fixation or serve as a platform for other nanoencapsulation goals."

AgeML: Age modelling with Machine Learning,"Jorge,Inigo,Jesus,Asier,Jorge,Inigo,Jesus,Asier,Jorge,Inigo,Jesus,Asier","An approach to age modeling involves the supervised prediction of age using machine learning from subject features. The derived age metrics are used to study the relationship between healthy and pathological aging in multiple body systems, as well as the interactions between them. We lack a standard for this type of age modeling. In this work we developed AgeML, an OpenSource software for age-prediction from any type of tabular clinical data following well-established and tested methodologies. The objective is to set standards for reproducibility and standardization of reporting in supervised age modeling tasks. AgeML does age modeling, calculates age deltas, the difference between predicted and chronological age, measures correlations between age deltas and factors, visualizes differences in age deltas of different clinical populations and classifies clinical populations based on age deltas. With this software we are able to reproduce published work and unveil novel relationships between body organs and polygenetic risk scores. AgeML is age modeling made easy for standardization and reproducibility."
Humans Exploit the Trade-Off Between Lateral Stability and Manoeuvrability During Walking,"Rucha N.,Francis M.,Anna,Xenia,Keith E.,Rucha N.,Francis M.,Anna,Xenia,Keith E.,Rucha N.,Francis M.,Anna,Xenia,Keith E.","People use the mechanical interplay between stability and manoeuvrability to successfully walk. During single limb support, body states (position and velocity) that increase lateral stability will inherently resist lateral manoeuvres, decrease medial stability, and facilitate medial manoeuvres. Although not well understood, people can make behavioural decisions exploiting this relationship in anticipation of perturbations or direction changes. To characterize the behavioural component of the stability-manoeuvrability relationship, twenty-four participants performed many repetitions of a discrete stepping task involving mid-trial reactive manoeuvres (medial or lateral direction) in a Baseline (no external perturbations) and Perturbed (random mediolateral perturbations applied to their pelvis) environment. We hypothesized people would make systematic changes in lateral stability dependent on both environment (increasing lateral stability in the Perturbed environment) and anticipated manoeuvre direction (reducing lateral stability to facilitate lateral manoeuvres). Participants increased lateral stability in the Perturbed environment, coinciding with an increase in manoeuvre reaction time for laterally but not medially directed manoeuvres. Moreover, we observed lower lateral stability in both environments when people anticipated making a lateral manoeuvre when compared to medial manoeuvres. These results support the hypothesis that people behaviourally exploit the mechanical relationship between lateral stability and manoeuvrability depending on walk task goals and external environment."

Directed assembly of single-stranded DNA fragments for data storage via enzyme-free catalytic splint ligation,"Gemma,Sriram,Mengdi,Brett,Anil,Gemma,Sriram,Mengdi,Brett,Anil,Gemma,Sriram,Mengdi,Brett,Anil","Oligonucleotides or gene fragments can be ligated in a specified order to create longer DNA assemblies. We present a method where DNA symbols, or oligos designed to encode information for data storage, are joined to linker sequences at either end. These linkers dictate the assembly order of the symbols; the order of the symbols can be changed by changing the sequences of the linkers attached to them. Utilizing a ligating DNAzyme as a catalytic splint, we achieve room-temperature, enzyme-free assembly, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional enzyme-based ligation methods. We demonstrate this technique by assembling three different five-symbol constructs, with the order of the symbols determined by their linking ends. This linker directed assembly technique allows data-encoding symbols to be assembled in any desired order. Furthermore, the DNAzyme-based assembly method is versatile and can be applied to various DNA assembly applications, particularly where cost-effectiveness and efficient room-temperature ligation are required."
Heterologous expression and optimization of fermentation conditions for recombinant ikarugamycin production,"Julia K.,Anna,Monique,Sebastian,Manuel,Tobias A. M.,Julia K.,Anna,Monique,Sebastian,Manuel,Tobias A. M.,Julia K.,Anna,Monique,Sebastian,Manuel,Tobias A. M.","Ikarugamycin is a member of the natural product family of the polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PoTeMs). The compound exhibits a diverse range of biological activities, including antimicrobial, antiprotozoal, anti-leukemic, and anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, it interferes with several crucial cellular functions, such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein uptake in macrophages, Nef-induced CD4 cell surface downregulation, and mechanisms of endocytosis. It is therefore used as a tool compound to study diverse biological processes. However, ikarugamycin commercial prices are very high, with up to 1300 € per 1 mg, thus limiting its application. We therefore set out to develop a high-yielding recombinant production platform of ikarugamycin by screening different expression vectors, recombinant host strains, and cultivation conditions. Overall, this has led to overproduction levels of more than 100 mg/L, which, together with a straightforward purification protocol, establishes biotechnological access to affordable ikarugamycin enabling its increased use in biomedical research in the future."
Texture profile analysis and rheology of plant-based and animal meat,"Reese A,Ethan C,Valerie E,Marc,Skyler R.,Ellen,Reese A,Ethan C,Valerie E,Marc,Skyler R.,Ellen,Reese A,Ethan C,Valerie E,Marc,Skyler R.,Ellen","Plant-based meat can help combat climate change and health risks associated with high meat consumption. To create adequate mimics of animal meats, plant-based meats must match in mouthfeel, taste, and texture. The gold standard to characterize the texture of meat is the double compression test, but this test suffers from a lack of standardization and reporting inconsistencies. Here we characterize the texture of five plant-based and three animal meats using texture profile analysis and rheology, and report ten mechanical features associated with each product's elasticity, viscosity, and loss of integrity. Our findings suggest that, of all ten features, the stiffness, storage, and loss moduli are the most meaningful and consistent parameter to report, while other parameters suffer from a lack of interpretability and inconsistent definitions. We find that the sample stiffness varies by an order of magnitude, from 418.9±41.7kPa for plant-based turkey to 56.7±14.1kPa for tofu. Similarly, the storage and loss moduli vary from 50.4±4.1kPa and 25.3±3.0kPa for plant-based turkey to 5.7±0.5kPa and 1.3±0.1kPa for tofu. All three animal products, animal turkey, sausage, and hotdog, consistently rank in between these two extremes. Our results suggest that--with the right ingredients, additives, and formulae--modern food fabrication techniques can create plant-based meats that successfully replicate the full viscoelastic texture spectrum of processed animal meat."
CandyCollect: An Open-Microfluidic Device for the Direct Capture and Enumeration of Salivary-Extracellular Vesicles,"Corinne A.,Kezia E.,Ingrid H.,Xiaojing,Daniel B.,Albert,Karen N.,Erwin,Sanitta,Alana F.,Ashleigh B.,Lydia L.,Corinne A.,Kezia E.,Ingrid H.,Xiaojing,Daniel B.,Albert,Karen N.,Erwin,Sanitta,Alana F.,Ashleigh B.,Lydia L.,Corinne A.,Kezia E.,Ingrid H.,Xiaojing,Daniel B.,Albert,Karen N.,Erwin,Sanitta,Alana F.,Ashleigh B.,Lydia L.","Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) are membrane-derived vesicles continuously shed by cells into the extracellular space. With cargos containing nucleic acids and other proteins, EVs play key roles in intercellular communication and other biological processes and are widely regarded as promising biomarkers for disease detection. EVs are abundantly found in virtually every biofluid, including blood, urine, and saliva. While there are numerous technologies to isolate EVs in blood and urine, isolating EVs from saliva remains a challenge, as it is highly complex and heterogeneous—cells, debris, and other proteins can all inhibit the isolation of EVs by traditional platforms. Here, we employ the CandyCollect, a lollipop-inspired sampling device with open microfluidic channels, as a non-invasive and patient-friendly alternative for the capture of salivary EVs. The CandyCollect simplifies sample preparation by effectively pre-concentrating EVs on the device surface before EVs are eluted off of the CandyCollect, labeled with cholesterol-tagged oligonucleotides, and subsequently detected by qPCR with primers specific for the tagged oligos to enumerate the relative number of EVs. We demonstrate that downstream EV cargo analysis can be performed using Simoa. Overall, the CandyCollect ushers a new method to capture, enumerate, and analyze salivary EVs."
Template-Independent Enzymatic RNA Synthesis,"Nilesh B,Tatiana,Taylor,Leonardo,Marc,Richard,Steven A,Nilesh B,Tatiana,Taylor,Leonardo,Marc,Richard,Steven A,Nilesh B,Tatiana,Taylor,Leonardo,Marc,Richard,Steven A","A route to prepare ribonucleoside triphosphates featuring a 3’-aminoxy (3’-O-NH,) removable blocking group is reported here. We then show that versions of two DNA polymerases, human DNA polymerase theta (Polθ) and mimiviral PrimPol, accept these triphosphates as substrates to add single nucleotides to an RNA primer under engineered conditions. Cleaving the O-N bond in the 3’-O-NH, group within the extended primer regenerates the 3’-OH group, facilitating subsequent polymerase cycles that add a second, selected, nucleotide. These enzymes and triphosphates together enable template-independent enzymatic RNA synthesis (TIERS) exploiting a cyclic reversible termination framework. The study shows that this process is ready for instrument adaptation by using it to add three ribonucleotides in three cycles using an engineered Polθ. This work creates a new way to synthesize RNA with a de novo defined sequence, without requiring the protecting groups, hazardous solvents, and sensitive reagents that bedevil phosphoramidite-based RNA synthesis."
High-Throughput Optimization of Paper-Based Cell-Free Biosensors,"David C.,John P.,Charles E.,Daniel A.,Aleksandr E.,Matthew M.,David C.,John P.,Charles E.,Daniel A.,Aleksandr E.,Matthew M.,David C.,John P.,Charles E.,Daniel A.,Aleksandr E.,Matthew M.","Cell-free expression systems maintain core cellular processes without intact cells and offer attractive properties as point-of-need biosensors. The ability to lyophilize, store, and use on- demand make these sensors usable in the field, and the lack of membranes means that there are no analyte transport issues and that new sensors can be deployed by simply adding a different DNA molecule. The lack of membranes also means that sensor designs and reaction optimizations can be screened in high throughput. While shelf stability has been demonstrated in specific cases using additives, these approaches are not universal to the myriad cell-free expression methods and formats. Here, we present new high-throughput screening methods to optimize cell-free expression formulations when embedded into paper for use as sensors. Our method leverages acoustic liquid handling to dispense reactions onto 384-well paper ticket formats and machine vision to quantify reaction performance from a colorimetric reporter enzyme. The throughput enabled shifts the bottleneck from experimental execution to selecting the experiments to execute; we therefore implement design-of-experiments to optimize the information gained from each design-build-test-learn cycle. We used these approaches to first optimize the performance of a low-cost cell-free expression formulation that was initially non- functional when embedded in paper, then further optimize it for tolerance to exposure to heat. With only 2 rounds of experimentation lasting 4 days total for each goal, the result are an energy mixture with 8% of the materials cost of a commonly used version and a formulation of excipients that maintain 60% of activity after 6 hours of storage at 50 °C and. Finally, we showcase the use of the cost-optimized formulation in a 3D-printed paperfluidic device where it outperforms the standard formulation at much lower cost."

Site-specific recombinases can be used to perform a variety of targeted DNA modifications such as excisions, inversions, and integrations. Their specificity and efficiency are offset by leaky expression and challenges in engineering a dynamic range of recombination rates. Here, we developed a tightly regulated, titratable Cre recombinase system that is tailored to achieve low recombination rates in ,. As a proof-of-concept application of this design, we developed a whole-cell recombination-based arsenic biosensor, with detection sensitivity comparable to traditional wet chemical methods. Furthermore, our biosensor allows decoupling exposure from measurement, which could benefit assays in more complex, realistic settings. This system enables targeted genetic recombination events at experimentally tunable rates with application in ecological, environmental and cell physiology research, and beyond."
Sustainable Regeneration of 20 Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases in a Reconstituted System Toward Self-Synthesizing Artificial Systems,"Katsumi,Keiko,Yoshihiro,Norikazu,Katsumi,Keiko,Yoshihiro,Norikazu,Katsumi,Keiko,Yoshihiro,Norikazu","In vitro construction of self-reproducible artificial systems is a major challenge in bottom-up synthetic biology. Here, we developed a reconstituted system capable of sustainably regenerating all 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), which are major components of the translation system. To achieve this, we needed five types of improvements: 1) optimization of aaRS sequences for efficient translation, 2) optimization of the composition of the translation system to enhance translation, 3) employment of another bacterial AlaRS and SerRS to improve each aminoacylation activity, 4) diminishing the translational inhibition caused by certain aaRS sequences by codon optimization and EF-P addition, and 5) balancing the DNA concentrations of 20 aaRSs to match each requirement. After these improvements, we succeeded in the sustainable regeneration of all 20 aaRSs for up to 20 cycles of 2.5-fold serial dilutions. These methodologies and results provide a substantial advancement toward the realization of self-reproducible artificial systems."

Conventionally, , is used to construct DNA fragments for gene transfer into the syn3B genome through Cre/, system. However, the construction process is challenging and time-consuming due to various issues, including the inhibition of , growth and unexpected recombination, especially with AT-rich DNA sequences such as those found in , genes. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop a new transformation method to overcome these issues. We assembled the vector and target DNA fragments using an in vitro homologous recombination system and subsequently transferred the products into the syn3B genome. We obtained approximately 10,∼10, recombinant colonies per milliliter of the original culture in eight days, which is four days shorter than the conventional period, without any recombination issues, even for AT-rich DNA. This method may be applicable to other gene manipulation systems based on Cre/, system."
An Expanded Substrate Scope for Cross-Chiral Ligation Enables Efficient Synthesis of Long L-RNAs,"Xuan,Jonathan T.,Xuan,Jonathan T.,Xuan,Jonathan T.","Despite the growing interest in mirror-image L-oligonucleotides, both as a robust nucleic acid analogue and as an artificial genetic polymer, their broader adoption in research and medicine remains hindered by challenges associated with the synthesis of long sequences, especially for L-RNA. Herein, we present a novel strategy for assembling long L-RNAs via the joining of two or more shorter fragments using cross-chiral ligase ribozymes together with new substrate activation chemistry. We show that 5′-monophosphorylated L-RNA, which is readily prepared by solid phase synthesis, can be activated by chemical attachment of a 5′-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) or diphosphate (ADP), yielding 5′-adenosyl (di-or tri-) phosphate L-RNA. The activation reaction is performed in mild aqueous conditions, proceeds efficiently with short or large L-RNA, and, yielding few biproducts, requires little or no further purification after activation. Importantly, both groups, when added to L-RNA, are compatible with ribozyme-mediated ligation, with the 5′-adenosyl triphosphate permitting rapid and efficient joining of multiple, long L-RNA strands. This is exemplified by the assembly of a 129-nt L-RNA molecule via a single cross-chiral ligation event. Overall, by relying on ribozymes that can be readily prepared by , transcription and L-RNA substrates that can be activated through simple chemistry, these methods are expected to make long L-RNAs more accessible to a wider range of researchers and facilitate the expansion of L-ON-based technologies."

As a result, the essential vitamin or its precursors must be uptaken from the environment and frequently supplemented in fermentations to achieve high cell densities. Engineering of a biotin-independent , strain is of interest to eliminate the need for the external biotin supply. Herein, we describe the construction of a biotin-independent yeast strain by engineering a bypass of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, an essential biotin-dependent enzyme in the synthesis of fatty acids. Besides complete rescue of growth in biotin-free media, the resulting , strains showed significantly improved growth on malonate compared to biotin. Beyond their industrial relevance, the yeast strains reported here can be valuable in areas of fundamental research, e.g., for developing a new selection marker or increasing the versatility of biotin-streptavidin technologies in living systems."

Chemically defined lipid diets reveal the versatility of lipidome remodeling in genomically minimal cells,"Nataliya,Lisa,Jana,Karim,James P.,Nataliya,Lisa,Jana,Karim,James P.,Nataliya,Lisa,Jana,Karim,James P.","All cells are encapsulated in a lipid membrane that provides a responsive interface between life and its environment. Although simple membranes can be built from a single type of lipid, cellular membranes contain 10s to 100s of unique lipid species. Deciphering the significance of lipidome complexity is a central challenge in understanding the design principles of living membranes. While functions of individual lipids have been extensively studied, understanding how lipidomes collectively contribute to membrane function and cell phenotypes is experimentally challenging in most organisms. To address this challenge, we turned to the simple pathogenic organism , and its genomically derived “Minimal Cell” JCVI-syn3B, to establish a living minimal membrane model system in which lipidome complexity can be experimentally manipulated. By complexing lipids with cyclodextrins, we introduce a chemically defined approach to deliver lipid ‘diets’ with different chemistries to cells, resulting in cellular lipidomes with as few as seven to nearly 30 lipids species. We explored how lipidome size and composition influences cell growth, osmotic sensitivity, and membrane adaptability to changes in growth temperature. Our findings indicate that lipidome composition dictates membrane adaptation to temperature change. Moreover, we show that lipidome diversity enhances cellular robustness to hypoosmotic shock. We further show that impaired acyl chain remodeling in the minimal cell is associated with impaired membrane temperature adaptation. Finally, we demonstrate as a proof of principle, how cells with tuneable lipidomes can be used as experimental chassis for screening membrane active antimicrobial peptides. Our study introduces an experimental resource and foundation for deciphering the role of lipidome complexity in membrane function and cellular fitness."

While the heterologous expression of metabolic pathways has achieved broad success, most approaches suffer a similar fate in low initial production levels that require extensive, resource-heavy iterative strain engineering refinement. Herein we introduce a growth-coupled biosynthetic (GrowBio) strategy that irrevocably connects microbial growth with specialized compound production. We demonstrate the plug-and-play versatility of GrowBio in the production of the structurally complex animal biopigment xanthommatin, a color-changing ommochrome with material and cosmetic potential. Xanthommatin biosynthesis directly fuels growth of a newly designed , 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate auxotroph (PUMA). Aided by genome-scale metabolic modeling, PUMA was designed and built to be controlled by endogenous formate co-produced as a coupled biosynthetic byproduct in the multistep conversion of tryptophan to xanthommatin. Adaptive laboratory evolution was utilized to streamline xanthommatin’s gram-scale bioproduction via growth rate selection, establishing GrowBio as a promising biotechnological approach for establishing and optimizing the microbial production of value-added molecules."
Antibiotic-Mediated Plasmonic Resonance on a Novel Nanopillar Metasurface Array,"Jacob,Jaewoo,Theodore,Sui,Ke,Jacob,Jaewoo,Theodore,Sui,Ke,Jacob,Jaewoo,Theodore,Sui,Ke","This study demonstrates a silicon nanopillar metasurface coupled with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) mediated by the presence of cephalexin antibiotics in solution for biosensing applications. A facile fabrication process was developed to create the metasurface on silicon wafers with a unique resonance signature. The resulting metasurface consists of periodic nanopillars approximately 180 nm in diameter, 210 nm deep, and with a controlled edge-to-edge separation of 200 nm. These dimensions were chosen based on a finite element method simulation that was used to investigate the ideal parameters to produce the desired resonance effect in the metasurface reflection spectra. Optimization of the nanopillar surface properties and the sidewall angle allowed for replication of the simulations. This metasurface was coupled with BSA-coated gold nanospheres (BSANS) to mediate the redshift of peak resonance wavelength values, occurring only in the presence of the antibiotic linker. The device fabricated herein exhibits a significant 22 nm wavelength shift resulting from changes to the local refractive index in the presence of the BSANS-antibiotic coupling. Further enhancement of the binding events is promoted by the LSPR hot spots formed between the nanoparticles and the metasurface allowing for sensitive and real-time detection."
"Rapid cyclic stretching induces synthetic, proinflammatory phenotypes in cultured human intestinal smooth muscle, with the potential to alter signaling to adjacent bowel cells","Sharon M,Katherine,Sierra E,Brooke,Molly,Se-Hwan,Deanne,Su Chin,Robert O,Sohaib Khalid,Sharon M,Katherine,Sierra E,Brooke,Molly,Se-Hwan,Deanne,Su Chin,Robert O,Sohaib Khalid,Sharon M,Katherine,Sierra E,Brooke,Molly,Se-Hwan,Deanne,Su Chin,Robert O,Sohaib Khalid","Background and Aims: Bowel smooth muscle experiences mechanical stress constantly during normal function, and pathologic mechanical stressors in disease states. We tested the hypothesis that pathologic mechanical stress could alter transcription to induce smooth muscle phenotypic class switching. Methods: Primary human intestinal smooth muscle cells (HISMCs), seeded on electrospun aligned poly-ε-caprolactone nano-fibrous scaffolds, were subjected to pathologic, high frequency (1 Hz) uniaxial 3% cyclic stretch (loaded) or kept unloaded in culture for 6 hours. Total RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, and quantitative immunohistochemistry defined loading-induced changes in gene expression. NicheNet predicted how differentially expressed genes might impact HISMCs and other bowel cells. Results: Loading induced differential expression of 4537 genes in HISMCs. Loaded HISMCs had a less contractile phenotype, with increased expression of synthetic SMC genes, proinflammatory cytokines, and altered expression of axon guidance molecules, growth factors and morphogens. Many differentially expressed genes encode secreted ligands that could act cell-autonomously on smooth muscle and on other cells in the bowel wall. Discussion: HISMCs demonstrate remarkably rapid phenotypic plasticity in response to mechanical stress that may convert contractile HISMCs into proliferative, fibroblast-like cells or proinflammatory cells. These mechanical stress-induced changes in HISMC gene expression may be relevant for human bowel disease."
Odor sensory tests vs. In-silico prediction for the high-definition quantification of olfaction dynamics,"Islam  Mohamed Sayed,Kazuki,Kazuko,Megumi,Takahiro,Kazuhide,Islam  Mohamed Sayed,Kazuki,Kazuko,Megumi,Takahiro,Kazuhide,Islam  Mohamed Sayed,Kazuki,Kazuko,Megumi,Takahiro,Kazuhide","The intricate dynamics of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the human respiratory system remain poorly understood. In the present study, we integrate odor sensory tests (OSTs) coupled with computational fluid dynamics and a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (CFD-PBPK) model to elucidate various aspects of the olfaction process. Safe yogurt-derived substances were incorporated in OSTs to prevent harmful exposure. Acetaldehyde was identified as a key active component in determining odor intensity, prompting further analysis of acetone and other four constituents of yogurt. Logarithmic correlations were established between the perceived odor intensity from the OSTs and both time-averaged absorption flux and equilibrium concentration within the olfactory mucus layer. These parameters were numerically captured, enabling the logarithmic approximation of odor intensity for different breathing profiles and the development of reliable prediction models for odor sensation based on quantifiable physiological parameters. The CFD-PBPK model captured detailed spatial and temporal variations of these parameters, which offers potential for future integrated/in-silico applications. Minor peaks of odor concentration were observed in the posterior olfactory regions during exhalation, revealing a retro-nasal phenomenon. Location-specific analysis revealed the nostrils and olfactory regions as the most accurate indicators of perceived odor intensity, proving the limitations of rough sensory assessments in the indoor/breathing zone scales. Acetone exhibited distinct absorption and desorption trends during the transitional phase between inhalation and exhalation, owing to the physical properties (diffusion and partition coefficients) that strongly characterize the olfaction dynamics."

The rectangular-prism-shaped magnetoelectric nanoparticle is a smart nanoparticle that produces a local electric field in response to an externally applied magnetic field. When externally activated, MENPs are preferentially attracted to the highly conductive cancer cell membranes, which occurs in cancer cells because of dysregulated ion flux across their membranes. In a pancreatic adenocarcinoma murine model, MENPs activated by external magnetic fields during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) resulted in a mean three-fold tumor volume reduction (62.3% vs 188.7%; P < .001) from a single treatment. In a longitudinal confirmatory study, 35% of mice treated with activated MENPs achieved a durable complete response for 14 weeks after one treatment. The degree of tumor volume reduction correlated with a decrease in MRI T2* relaxation time (r = .351; P = .039) which suggests that MENPs have a potential to serve as a predictive nanotheranostic agent at time of treatment. There were no discernable toxicities associated with MENPs at any timepoint or on histopathological analysis of major organs. MENPs are a noninvasive alternative modality for the treatment of cancer."
A Streamlined High-Throughput LC-MS Assay for Quantifying Peptide Degradation in Cell Culture,"Samuel J,Abolfazl S,E. Thomas,Samuel J,Abolfazl S,E. Thomas,Samuel J,Abolfazl S,E. Thomas","Peptides are widely used in biomaterials due to their easy of synthesis, ability to signal cells, and modify the properties of biomaterials. A key benefit of using peptides is that they are natural substrates for cell-secreted enzymes, which creates the possibility of utilizing cell-secreted enzymes for tuning cell-material interactions. However, these enzymes can also induce unwanted degradation of bioactive peptides in biomaterials, or in peptide therapies. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a widely used, powerful methodology that can separate complex mixtures of molecules and quantify numerous analytes within a single run. There are several challenges in using LC-MS for the multiplexed quantification of cell-induced peptide degradation, including the need for non-degradable internal standards and the identification of optimal sample storage conditions. Another problem is that cell culture media and biological samples typically contain both proteins and lipids that can accumulate on chromatography columns and degrade their performance. However, removing these constituents can be expensive, time consuming, and increases sample variability. Here we show that directly injecting samples onto the LC-MS without any purification enables rapid and accurate quantification of peptide concentration, and that hundreds of LC-MS runs can be done on a single column without a significantly diminish the ability to quantify the degradation of peptide libraries. We also show that column failure is evident when hydrophilic peptides fail to be retained on the column, and this can be easily identified using standard peptide mixtures for column benchmarking. In total, this work introduces a simple and effective method for simultaneously quantifying the degradation of dozens of peptides in cell culture. By providing a streamlined and cost-effective method for the direct quantification of peptide degradation in complex biological samples, this work enables more efficient assessment of peptide stability and functionality, facilitating the development of advanced biomaterials and peptide-based therapies."
Physical traits of supercompetitors in cell competition,"Logan C,Shiladitya,Logan C,Shiladitya,Logan C,Shiladitya","Cell competition is a fitness control mechanism in tissues, where less fit cells are eliminated to maintain tissue homeostasis. Two primary mechanisms of cell elimination have been identified in cell competition studies: contact-dependent cell death and mechanical compression-driven apoptosis. While both occur in tissues, their combined impact on population dynamics is unclear. Here we develop a cell-based computational model to study competition between two cell types with differing physical properties. The model integrates cellular mechanics with cell-cycle dynamics, contact-induced apoptosis, and cell extrusion via mechanical stress. Using this model, we explored how differences in physical traits between cell types influence competitive interactions. Our findings show that differences in cell compressibility alone can drive mechanical competition, with stiffer cells outcompeting softer ones in otherwise identical populations. Surprisingly, mutations that reduce cell stiffness, combined with decreased contact inhibition of proliferation, can create a ""soft"" super-competitive mutant. We demonstrate that changes in apoptosis sensitivity, cell adhesion, and cell size significantly affect growth potential and susceptibility to apoptosis. Furthermore, mutant cell colonies require a critical colony size, dependent on cell compressibility, to overtake the surrounding wild-type tissue. For colonies below the critical size, the elimination process is stochastic, driven by a protrusive finger-like instability in the interface between two cells that promote invasion of the supercompetitors."
The 3D point spread function can be autoencoded in latent space,"Axel,Konrad,Johan,Axel,Konrad,Johan,Axel,Konrad,Johan",The 3D point spread function of a fluorescence emitter in a living cell is often different from that of the z-stack of bead images typically used as a reference. Here we show that the location in z of a fluorescent emitter can be directly accessed in the latent space of an autoencoder trained on the sample images without z-reference data. The corresponding decoding network represents an accurate point spread function.
Optimal network sizes for most robust Turing patterns,"Hazlam S,Aibek,Antonio,Robert G,Hazlam S,Aibek,Antonio,Robert G,Hazlam S,Aibek,Antonio,Robert G","Many cellular patterns exhibit a reaction-diffusion component, suggesting that Turing instability may contribute to pattern formation. However, biological gene-regulatory pathways are more complex than simple Turing activator-inhibitor models and generally do not require fine-tuning of parameters as dictated by the Turing conditions. To address these issues, we employ random matrix theory to analyze the Jacobian matrices of larger networks with robust statistical properties. Our analysis reveals that Turing patterns are more likely to occur by chance than previously thought and that the most robust Turing networks have an optimal size, surprisingly consisting only of a handful of molecular species, thus significantly increasing their identifiability in biological systems. This optimal size emerges from a tradeoff between the highest stability in small networks and the greatest instability with diffusion in large networks. Furthermore, we find that with multiple immobile nodes, differential diffusion ceases to be important for Turing patterns. Our findings may inform future synthetic biology approaches and provide insights into bridging the gap to complex developmental pathways."
Innovative Strategies for Enhancing Signal-to-Noise Ratio in Single-molecule Imaging: The Influence of Molecular Motion,"Gayun,Gyeongho,Seongyu,Jae-Hyung,Jong-Bong,Gayun,Gyeongho,Seongyu,Jae-Hyung,Jong-Bong,Gayun,Gyeongho,Seongyu,Jae-Hyung,Jong-Bong","Single-molecule fluorescence imaging has extensively revealed the dynamic and structural characteristics of biomolecules. However, its application is limited by the upper concentration of fluorophore-tagged biomolecules, which is in the sub-ten nanomolar range. We found that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in single-molecule fluorescence imaging is strongly influenced by the size of fluorophore-labeled molecules in solution. Our computational simulations suggest that the faster diffusion of background fluorophores can enhance the SNR of target molecules. Moreover, we identified that the molecular motion through fluid flow can improve SNR. This study provides a novel perspective by emphasizing the importance of molecular motion in SNR and propose a rapid barrier-free method to increase the upper concentration limit in single-molecule imaging."
Insights into a clock's fidelity through vesicular encapsulation,"Alexander Zhan Tu,Andy,Anand Bala,Alexander Zhan Tu,Andy,Anand Bala,Alexander Zhan Tu,Andy,Anand Bala","The single-celled cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus, generates circadian rhythms with exceptional fidelity and synchrony despite their femtoliter volumes. Here, we explore the mechanistic aspects of this fidelity, by reconstituting the KaiABC post-translational oscillator (PTO) in cell-mimetic giant vesicles (GUVs) under well-defined conditions in vitro. PTO proteins were encapsulated with a coefficient of variation that closely matched protein variations observed in live cells. Using fluorescently labeled KaiB and confocal microscopy, we were able to measure circadian rhythms generated by thousands of encapsulated PTOs at the single-vesicle level for several days as a function of protein concentration and GUV size. We find that PTO fidelity decreased with decreasing levels of encapsulated PTO proteins and in smaller GUVs. We also observed that in encapsulated PTOs, a significant fraction of KaiB localized to GUV membranes like it does in cyanobacteria. A mathematical model that uses empirical bulk concentration and stoichiometry limitations suggests that cyanobacteria overcome challenges to fidelity by expressing high levels of PTO proteins along with the CikA and SasA proteins, which buffer stochastic variations in the levels of KaiA and KaiB, respectively. Further, the model suggests that the transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL) contributes at most a small percentage to the overall fidelity of the cyanobacterial circadian clock under constant conditions but is essential for maintaining phase synchrony. Our results are the first experimental demonstration of populations of synthetic cells that can autonomously keep circadian time. Additionally, the approach of using bulk relationships to understand complex phenomena in cell-like systems could be useful for understanding other collective behavior important in biology, such as liquid-liquid phase separation."
3D super-resolution imaging of PSD95 reveals an abundance of diffuse protein supercomplexes in the mouse brain,"Sam,Edita,Anoushka,Katie,Leila,Candace,Takeshi,Alexandre,Alexander,Gregory,Kevin,Seth G.N.,Mathew H,Steven F,Sam,Edita,Anoushka,Katie,Leila,Candace,Takeshi,Alexandre,Alexander,Gregory,Kevin,Seth G.N.,Mathew H,Steven F,Sam,Edita,Anoushka,Katie,Leila,Candace,Takeshi,Alexandre,Alexander,Gregory,Kevin,Seth G.N.,Mathew H,Steven F","PSD95 is an abundant scaffolding protein that assembles multiprotein complexes controlling synaptic physiology and behavior. Confocal microscopy has previously shown that PSD95 is enriched in the postsynaptic terminals of excitatory synapses and 2D super-resolution microscopy further revealed that it forms nanoclusters. In this study, we utilized 3D super-resolution microscopy to examine the nanoarchitecture of PSD95 in the mouse brain, characterizing over 8 million molecules. While we were able to identify structural subtypes previously reported, imaging in 3D allowed us to classify these with higher accuracy. Furthermore, 3D super-resolution microscopy enabled the quantification of protein levels, revealing an abundance of PSD95 molecules existed outside of synapses as a diffuse population of supercomplexes, containing multiple copies of PSD95. Further analysis of the supercomplexes containing two units identified two populations: one that had PSD95 molecules separated by 39 ± 2 nm, and a second with a separation of 94 ± 27 nm. These results suggest that PSD95 supercomplexes containing multiple protein copies assemble outside the synapse and then integrate into the synapse to form a supramolecular nanocluster architecture."
Impact of an Oxidative RNA Lesion on in vitro Replication Catalyzed by SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase,"Masataka,Kaoru,Kiyoe,Akira,Masataka,Kaoru,Kiyoe,Akira,Masataka,Kaoru,Kiyoe,Akira","The production of reactive oxygen species in response to RNA virus infection results in the oxidation of viral genomic RNA within infected cells. These oxidative RNA lesions undergo replication catalyzed by the viral replisome. G to U transversion mutations are frequently observed in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and may be linked to the replication process catalyzed by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) past the oxidative RNA lesion 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-riboguanosine (8-oxo-rG). To better understand the mechanism of viral RNA mutagenesis, it is crucial to elucidate the role of RdRp in replicating across oxidative lesions. In this study, we investigated the RNA synthesis catalyzed by the reconstituted SARS-CoV-2 RdRp past a single 8-oxo-rG. The RdRp-mediated primer extension was significantly inhibited by 8-oxo-rG on the template RNA. During the blockage of the extension reaction, the rate of product release by RdRp was extremely slow, indicating that the RdRp machinery remained bound to the replicating primer/template RNA. Once RdRp was able to bypass 8-oxo-rG, it preferentially incorporated rCMP, with a lesser amount of rAMP opposite 8-oxo-rG. In contrast, RdRp demonstrated greater activity in extending from the mutagenic rA:8-oxo-rG terminus compared to the lower efficiency of extension from the rC:8-oxo-rG pair. Based on steady-state kinetic analyses for the incorporation of rNMPs opposite 8-oxo-rG and chain extension from rC:8-oxo-rG or rA:8-oxo-rG, the relative bypass frequency for rA:8-oxo-rG was found to be seven-fold higher than that for rC:8-oxo-rG. Therefore, the properties of RdRp indicated in this study may contribute to the mechanism of mutagenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome."

Harnessing our previously described workflow for the optimized preparation of carmofur using benchtop ,F NMR spectroscopy, here, we prepared and evaluated a synthetic library of nine carmofur analogs with a selection of side chain motifs or single-atom substitution to explore the diversifiability of these compounds as M, inhibitors, where we discovered that a hexyl carbamate analog outperformed carmofur, and as antiproliferative agents in model human cell lines to identify differences in potency when the carbonyl electrophilicity and/or alkyl side chains are modified. Finally, we describe a novel workflow for the evaluation of membrane-rupturing small molecules through imaging of fluorescently labeled giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), and through this, we identified two lipophilic urethane analogs of carmofur bearing dodecyl urethane and octadecyl urethane side chains that have potent membrane-rupturing capability in the nanomolar range, providing insight into a potential mechanism for the , activities of lipidated 5-fluorouracil analogs."
Structural organization of p62 filaments and the cellular ultrastructure of calcium-rich p62-enwrapped lipid droplet cargo,"Sabrina,Lisa,Alexandros,Siavash,Olivera,Peng-Han,Lokesh,Lipi,Joerg,Rafal E,Carsten,Sabrina,Lisa,Alexandros,Siavash,Olivera,Peng-Han,Lokesh,Lipi,Joerg,Rafal E,Carsten,Sabrina,Lisa,Alexandros,Siavash,Olivera,Peng-Han,Lokesh,Lipi,Joerg,Rafal E,Carsten","The selective autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1 (from hereon p62) is known to form higher-order filaments in vitro and to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation when mixed with poly-ubiquitin. We determined the full-length cryo-EM structure of p62 and elucidated a structured double helical filament scaffold associated with the PB1-domain and the flexible C-terminal part residing in the lumen and the solvent-accessible major groove. At different pH values and upon binding to soluble LC3, LC3-conjugated membranes and poly-ubiquitin, we observed p62 filament re-arrangements in the form of structural unwinding, disassembly, lateral association and bundling, respectively. In the cellular environment, under conditions of ATG5 knockdown leading to stalled autophagy, we imaged high-contrast layers consisting of p62 oligomers enwrapping lipid droplets by cryogenic electron tomography in cellulo, which we identified as calcium phosphate by compositional spectroscopy analysis. Together, we visualized the cellular ultrastructure of p62 oligomers with high calcium content as a potential intermediate step of autophagy initiation."
Oligomerization-dependent and synergistic regulation of Cdc42 GTPase cycling by a GEF and a GAP,"Sophie,Werner Karl-Gustaf,Frank,Liedewij,Sophie,Werner Karl-Gustaf,Frank,Liedewij,Sophie,Werner Karl-Gustaf,Frank,Liedewij","Cell polarity is a crucial biological process essential for cell division, directed growth, and motility. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, polarity establishment centers around the small Rho-type GTPase Cdc42, which cycles between GTPbound and GDP-bound states, regulated by GEFs like Cdc24 and GAPs such as Rga2. To dissect the dynamic regulation of Cdc42, we employed in vitro GTPase assays, revealing inverse concentration-dependent profiles for Cdc24 and Rga2: with increasing concentration, Cdc24s GEF activity is non-linear and oligomerization-dependent, which is possibly linked to the relief of its self-inhibition. In contrast, Rga2s GAP activity saturates, likely due to self-inhibition upon oligomerization. Together, Cdc24 and Rga2 exhibit a strong synergy driven by weak Cdc24-Rga2 binding. We propose that the synergy stems from Cdc24 alleviating the self-inhibition of oligomeric Rga2. We believe this synergy contributes to efficient regulation of Cdc42s GTPase cycle over a wide range of cycling rates, enabling cells to resourcefully establish polarity. As Cdc42 is highly conserved among eukaryotes, we propose the GEF-GAP synergy to be a general regulatory property in other eukaryotes."
Cell shape noise strength regulates shape dynamics during EMT-associated cell spreading,"Wolfram,Iskra,Guillaume,Ewa K,Wolfram,Iskra,Guillaume,Ewa K,Wolfram,Iskra,Guillaume,Ewa K","Cellular shape is intimately linked to cell function and state, and transitions between cell states are tightly coupled to shape changes. Yet, shape has been largely overlooked in state transitions studies. Here, we combine morphometric analysis with theoretical modeling and molecular perturbations to interrogate cell shape dynamics during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Using stochastic inference, we extract the morphogenetic landscape underlying EMT. We show that within this landscape, EMT-associated cell spreading reflects a transition between shape attractors. Strikingly, we observe a peak in cell shape noise strength concomitant with spreading, and show that higher shape noise accelerates transitions between shape attractors. Our analysis framework will be widely applicable to quantitative cell shape investigations in physiology and disease. Together, our results identify a key role for cellular stochasticity as a regulator of shape change rates, and highlight that shape dynamics yield rich phenotypic information that enhance our understanding of cellular states."
Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 controls triacylglycerol hydrolysis in cardiomyocytes,"Michael G,Chelsea D,Elyn M,Connie L.

K,Haoning Howard,Eric D,Leo T,Renata,Jason,David,Peter,Leonard J,Armando,James D","Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 1 is one of four isozymes that inhibit the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA via pyruvate dehydrogenase. PDK activity is elevated in fasting or starvation conditions to conserve carbohydrate reserves. PDK has also been shown to increase mitochondrial fatty acid utilization. In cardiomyocytes, metabolic flexibility is crucial for the fulfillment of high energy requirements. The PDK1 isoform is abundant in cardiomyocytes, but its specific contribution to cardiomyocyte metabolism is unclear. Here we show that PDK1 regulates cardiomyocyte fuel preference by mediating triacylglycerol turnover in differentiated H9c2 myoblasts using lentiviral shRNA to knockdown Pdk1. Somewhat surprisingly, PDK1 loss did not affect overall PDH activity, basal glycolysis, or glucose oxidation revealed by oxygen consumption rate experiments and 13C6 glucose labelling. On the other hand, we observed decreased triacylglycerol turnover in H9c2 cells with PDK1 knockdown, which was accompanied by decreased mitochondrial fatty acid utilization following nutrient deprivation. 13C16 palmitate tracing of uniformly labelled acyl chains revealed minimal acyl chain shuffling within triacylglycerol, indicating that the triacylglycerol hydrolysis, and not re-esterification, was dysfunctional in PDK1 suppressed cells. Importantly, PDK1 loss did not significantly impact the cellular lipidome or triacylglycerol accumulation following palmitic acid treatment, suggesting that effects of PDK1 on lipid metabolism were specific to the nutrient-deprived state. We validated that PDK1 loss decreased triacylglycerol turnover in Pdk1 knockout mice. Together, these findings implicate a novel role for PDK1 in lipid metabolism in cardiomyocytes, independent of its canonical roles in glucose metabolism."
Mechanochemical forces regulate the composition and fate of stalled nascent chains,"Danish,Ananya A,Cole S,Onn,Danish,Ananya A,Cole S,Onn,Danish,Ananya A,Cole S,Onn","The ribosome-associated ,uality ,ontrol (RQC) pathway resolves stalled ribosomes. As part of RQC, stalled nascent polypeptide chains (NCs) are appended with ,rboxy-,erminal amino acids (CAT tails) in an mRNA-free, non-canonical elongation process. CAT tail composition includes Ala, Thr, and potentially other residues. The relationship between CAT tail composition and function has remained unknown. Using biochemical approaches in yeast, we discovered that mechanochemical forces on the NC regulate CAT tailing. We propose CAT tailing initially operates in an “extrusion mode” that increases NC lysine accessibility for on-ribosome ubiquitination. Thr in CAT tails enhances NC extrusion by preventing formation of polyalanine, which can form α-helices that lower extrusion efficiency and disrupt termination of CAT tailing. After NC ubiquitylation, pulling forces on the NC switch CAT tailing to an Ala-only “release mode” which facilitates nascent chain release from large ribosomal subunits and NC degradation. Failure to switch from extrusion to release mode leads to accumulation of NCs on large ribosomal subunits and proteotoxic aggregation of Thr-rich CAT tails."
Biotic resistance predictably shifts microbial invasion regimes,"Xiaozhou,Or,Christoph,Xiaozhou,Or,Christoph,Xiaozhou,Or,Christoph","Invading new territory is a central aspect of the microbial lifestyle, allowing microbes to expand to remote locations and pathogens to spread and infect their hosts. However, invading microbes rarely find novel territories uninhabited. In such a scenario, resident microbes can interact with the newcomers and, in many cases, impede their invasion, an effect known as biotic resistance. Accordingly, invasions are shaped by the interplay between dispersal and resistance. However, these two factors are difficult to disentangle or manipulate in natural systems, making their interplay difficult to understand. To address this challenge, we tracked microbial invasions in the lab over space and time, first in a model system of two interacting microbes, then in a multi-strain system involving a pathogen invading resident communities. In the presence of biotic resistance, we observed three qualitatively different invasion regimes: consistent, pulsed, and pinned, where, in the third regime, strong biotic resistance stalled the invasion entirely despite ongoing invader dispersal. Surprisingly, these rich invasion dynamics could be qualitatively predicted with a simple, parameter-free framework that ignores individual species interactions, even for rather complex communities. Moreover, we showed that this simple framework could accurately predict simulated invasions from different mechanistic models, indicating its broad applicability. Our work offers a thorough understanding of how biotic resistance impacts invasions and introduces a predictive tool to identify invasion-resistant communities."
Role of ribosomal protein bS1 in orthogonal mRNA start codon selection,"Kristina V,Rebecca A,Minji,Jamie H D,Kristina V,Rebecca A,Minji,Jamie H D,Kristina V,Rebecca A,Minji,Jamie H D","In many bacteria, the location of the mRNA start codon is determined by a short ribosome binding site sequence that base pairs with the 3′-end of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the 30S subunit. Many groups have changed these short sequences, termed the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence in the mRNA and the anti-Shine-Dalgarno (ASD) sequence in 16S rRNA, to create ""orthogonal"" ribosomes to enable the synthesis of orthogonal polymers in the presence of the endogenous translation machinery. However, orthogonal ribosomes are prone to SD-independent translation. Ribosomal protein bS1, which binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, is thought to promote translation initiation by shuttling mRNA to the ribosome. Thus, a better understanding of how the SD and bS1 contribute to start codon selection could help efforts to improve the orthogonality of ribosomes. Here we engineered the , ribosome to prevent binding of bS1 to the 30S subunit, to separate the activity of bS1 binding to the ribosome from the role of the mRNA SD sequence in start codon selection. We find that ribosomes lacking bS1 are slightly less active than wild-type ribosomes ,. Furthermore, orthogonal 30S subunits lacking bS1 do not have improved orthogonality. Our findings suggest that mRNA features outside the SD sequence and independent of bS1 binding to the ribosome likely contribute to start codon selection and the lack of orthogonality of present orthogonal ribosomes."
Systems-level analysis provides insights on methanol-based production of L-glutamate and its decarboxylation product γ-aminobutyric acid by Bacillus methanolicus,"Marta,Ingemar,David,Trygve,Tobias,Dušan,Carsten,Stéphanie,Gregor,Christian,Volker F,Luciana,Cláudia M,Marta,Ingemar,David,Trygve,Tobias,Dušan,Carsten,Stéphanie,Gregor,Christian,Volker F,Luciana,Cláudia M,Marta,Ingemar,David,Trygve,Tobias,Dušan,Carsten,Stéphanie,Gregor,Christian,Volker F,Luciana,Cláudia M","Background
Bacillus methanolicus is the next workhorse in biotechnology using methanol, an alternative and economical one-carbon feedstock that can be obtained directly from carbon dioxide, as both carbon and energy source for the production of various value-added chemicals. The wild-type strain B. methanolicus MGA3 naturally overproduces L-glutamate in methanol-based fed-batch fermentations.
Results
Here we generated, by induced mutagenesis, an evolved B. methanolicus strain exhibiting enhanced L-glutamate production capability (>150%). To showcase the potential of this evolved strain, further metabolic engineering enabled the production of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) directly from L-glutamate, with a yield of 13.2 g/L from methanol during fed-batch fermentations. By using a systems-level analysis, encompassing whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, fluxome analysis and genome-scale metabolic modelling, we were able to elucidate the metabolic and regulatory adaptations that sustain the biosynthesis of these products. The metabolism of the mutant strain evolved to prioritize energy conservation and efficient carbon utilization. Key metabolic shifts include the downregulation of energy-intensive processes such as flagellation and motility and the rerouting of carbon fluxes towards α-ketoglutarate and its derivative, L-glutamate. Moreover, we observed that transformation of the evolved strain with a GABA biosynthesis plasmid had a positive effect on L-glutamate production, likely due to an upregulation of various transaminases involved in the L-glutamate biosynthesis from α-ketoglutarate.
Conclusions
These results and insights provide a foundation for further rational metabolic engineering and bioprocess optimization, enhancing the industrial viability of B. methanolicus for sustainable production of L-glutamate and its derivatives."

We consolidated multi-omics data sets with selected curated information from the public domain, such as structure prediction, substrate annotation, disease association and subcellular localization. This SLC-centric knowledge is made accessible to the scientific community via a web portal, featuring interactive dashboards and a tool for family-wide, tree-based visualization of SLC properties. Making use of the systematically collected and curated data sets, we selected eight feature-dimensions to compute an integrated functional landscape of human SLCs. This landscape represents various functional aspects, harmonizing local and global features of the underlying data sets, as demonstrated by inspecting structural folds and subcellular locations of selected transporters. Based on all available data sets and their integration, we assigned a biochemical/biological function to each SLC, making it one of the largest systematic annotations of human gene function and likely acting as a blueprint for future endeavours."
Computational Microbiome Pharmacology Analysis Elucidates the Anti-Cancer Potential of Vaginal Microbes and Metabolites,"Damilola Christianah,Smrutiti,Alicia R,Kenzie,Alana,Romel D,Laura,Michelle,Xuanlin,Elizabeth,Nelly,Samantha,Timothy R,Elly,Sean M,Claire,Fernanda L,Florian,Jairam R,Adam D,Leopold N.,Douglas  K,Damilola Christianah,Smrutiti,Alicia R,Kenzie,Alana,Romel D,Laura,Michelle,Xuanlin,Elizabeth,Nelly,Samantha,Timothy R,Elly,Sean M,Claire,Fernanda L,Florian,Jairam R,Adam D,Leopold N.,Douglas  K,Damilola Christianah,Smrutiti,Alicia R,Kenzie,Alana,Romel D,Laura,Michelle,Xuanlin,Elizabeth,Nelly,Samantha,Timothy R,Elly,Sean M,Claire,Fernanda L,Florian,Jairam R,Adam D,Leopold N.,Douglas  K","The vaginal microbiome's role in risk, progression, and treatment of female cancers has been widely explored. Yet, there remains a need to develop methods to understand the interaction of microbiome factors with host cells and to characterize their potential therapeutic functions. To address this challenge, we developed a systems biology framework we term the Pharmacobiome for microbiome pharmacology analysis. The Pharmacobiome framework evaluates similarities between microbes and microbial byproducts and known drugs based on their impact on host transcriptomic cellular signatures. Here, we apply our framework to characterization of the Anti-Gynecologic Cancer Vaginal Pharmacobiome. Using published vaginal microbiome multi-omics data from the Partners PrEP clinical trial, we constructed vaginal epithelial gene signatures associated with each profiled vaginal microbe and metabolite. We compared these microbiome-associated host gene signatures to post-drug perturbation host gene signatures associated with 35 FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures database to identify vaginal microbes and metabolites with high statistical and functional similarity to these drugs. We found that Lactobacilli and their metabolites can regulate host gene expression in ways similar to many anti-cancer drugs. Additionally, we experimentally tested our model prediction that taurine, a metabolite produced by L. crispatus, kills cancerous breast and endometrial cancer cells. Our study shows that the Pharmacobiome is a powerful framework for characterizing the anti-cancer therapeutic potential of vaginal microbiome factors with generalizability to other cancers, microbiomes, and diseases."
Intrinsically disordered RNA-binding motifs cooperate to catalyze RNA folding and drive phase separation,"Annika,Thomas,Janosch,Melina,Mario,Elena,Andre P,Irina,Wieland,Marisa,Roland,Robert,Jean-Christophe,Dorothee,Kathi,Michael,Dierk,Annika,Thomas,Janosch,Melina,Mario,Elena,Andre P,Irina,Wieland,Marisa,Roland,Robert,Jean-Christophe,Dorothee,Kathi,Michael,Dierk,Annika,Thomas,Janosch,Melina,Mario,Elena,Andre P,Irina,Wieland,Marisa,Roland,Robert,Jean-Christophe,Dorothee,Kathi,Michael,Dierk","RNA-binding proteins are essential for gene regulation and the spatial organization of cells. Here, we report that the yeast ribosome biogenesis factor Loc1p is an intrinsically disordered RNA-binding protein with eight repeating positively charged, unstructured nucleic acid binding (PUN) motifs. While a single of these previously undefined motifs stabilizes folded RNAs, multiple copies strongly cooperate to catalyze RNA folding. In the presence of RNA, these multivalent PUN motifs drive phase separation. Proteome-wide searches in pro- and eukaryotes for proteins with similar arrays of PUN motifs reveal a strong enrichment in RNA-mediated processes and DNA remodeling. Thus, PUN motifs are potentially involved in a large variety of RNA- and DNA-related processes by concentrating them in membrane-less organelles. The general function and wide distribution of PUN motifs across species suggests that in an ancient RNA world PUN-like motifs may have supported the correct folding of early ribozymes."
Lowering the switching cost related to the activation of burdensome gene circuits promotes cell population homogeneity and productivity,"Lucas,Vincent,Juan Andres Martinez,Julian,Samuel,Andrew,Frank,Lucas,Vincent,Juan Andres Martinez,Julian,Samuel,Andrew,Frank,Lucas,Vincent,Juan Andres Martinez,Julian,Samuel,Andrew,Frank","The activation of gene circuits can impose a significant burden on cells, leading to heterogeneous expression and reduced productivity. In this work, we focused on the T7 production system in E. coli BL21, a prime example of a burdensome gene circuit, to investigate the main cause for this gene expression heterogeneity and methods to mitigate it. Based on continuous cultivation analyzed and control by automated flow cytometry, we quantified the trade-off between cellular growth and gene expression and tracked the cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression (measured as entropy). We concluded that the growth reduction associated to the activation of the burdensome gene circuit, i.e., the switching cost, is at the origin of the population heterogeneity. The loss of growth rate imposed by the burdensome activation of the gene is compensated at the population level by the overgrowth of less induced cells that safeguard the population by generating entropy. We tried to homogenize the population by pulsing the inducer with increasing frequency but found that the population escapes control through promoter mutation, leading to a genotype exhibiting reduced gene expression, but also, reduced entropy. To engineer a more homogeneous population without sacrificing gene expression, we decreased the switching cost associated to the induction by lowering the quality of the main carbon source. This strategy successfully led to a more homogeneous and productive population. Our approach allows for a precise quantification of the trade-off between growth and gene expression in cell population cultivated under dynamic conditions and highlights the importance of the switching cost for designing efficient approaches of cell population control."

Empowering future scientists: Mentors employ various strategies to engage students in professional science disciplinary literacy practices,"Trisha,Tanya,Gwendolyn,Gary S,Sarah C,Trisha,Tanya,Gwendolyn,Gary S,Sarah C,Trisha,Tanya,Gwendolyn,Gary S,Sarah C","Peer-review and publication are important parts of the scientific enterprise, and research has shown that engaging students in such scholarly practices helps build their sense of belonging and scientific identity. Yet, these disciplinary literacy skills and professional practices are often part of the hidden curriculum of science research, thus excluding students and others from fully understanding ways in which scientific knowledge is constructed, refined, and disseminated even though students are participating in such activities. Secondary students are increasingly involved in scientific research projects that include authentic disciplinary literacy components such as research proposals, posters, videos, and scientific research papers. More and more, students are also engaging in professional practice of publishing their scientific research papers through dedicated secondary science journals. How teachers and other mentors support the development of professional disciplinary literacies in students is critical to understand as part of supporting more student participation in research. To this end, we used a mixed- methods study of interviews and surveys to examine the experience and conceptions of the mentors (teachers and professional scientists) who guided pre-college students through the writing and publication of their scientific research projects. Analyzing our data from a lens of cognitive apprenticeship, we find that mentors encourage independence by primarily employing the method of “exploration”. We also find that mentors have divergent views on the value of publication within science, versus for student scientists specifically. Our findings suggest that mentors could work to explicitly reveal their own thinking within science writing to provide more sequenced support for student scientists."
Metabolic interplay drives population cycles in a cross-feeding microbial community,"Tyler,Christopher A,Ophelia,Tyler,Christopher A,Ophelia,Tyler,Christopher A,Ophelia","Population cycles are prevalent in ecosystems and play key roles in determining their functions. While multiple mechanisms have been theoretically shown to generate population cycles, there are limited examples of mutualisms driving self-sustained oscillations. Using an engineered microbial community that cross-feeds essential amino acids, we experimentally demonstrate cycles in strain abundance that are robust across environmental conditions. A nonlinear dynamical model that incorporates the experimentally observed cross-inhibition of amino acid production recapitulates the population cycles. The model shows that the cycles represent internally generated relaxation oscillations, which emerge when fast resource dynamics with positive feedback drive slow changes in strain abundance. Our findings highlight the critical role of resource dynamics and feedback in shaping population cycles in microbial communities and have implications for biotechnology."
Anticipatory emotions and academic performance: The role of boredom in a preservice teachers’ lab experience,"Jesús A.,José María,Cristina,María Rocío,Jesús A.,José María,Cristina,María Rocío,Jesús A.,José María,Cristina,María Rocío","Affective experiences within academic contexts significantly influence educational outcomes. Despite this, the literature reveals a gap in generalising these effects to specific classroom activities, partly arising from the absence of suitable instruments to measure emotions in situational educational scenarios. Our study introduces an experience sampling method to measure sixteen discrete emotional states, deriving two scales for positive and negative activating emotions. Grounded in psychological and neuroscientific theories that integrate emotion with cognition, our research explores the interplay between prior knowledge, preservice teachers’ anticipatory situational emotions, and subsequent learning in an experimental science education context. Analysing data from 269 preservice teachers from diverse backgrounds (STEM and non-STEM) at the upper-secondary level, we found that negative activating emotions are often rooted in non-STEM backgrounds and exacerbated by limited prior science knowledge. These negative emotions impact achievement and learning primarily through the mediating role of boredom. Furthermore, our results indicate that the detrimental impact of boredom on achievement is significantly influenced by prior knowledge, with a more pronounced effect on students with lower levels. Given that emotions are amenable to intervention, our findings propose that specifically addressing boredom in students with low prior knowledge could amplify the benefits of educational strategies."
Quantifying Data Distortion in Bar Graphs in Biological Research,"Teng-Jui,Markita P.,Teng-Jui,Markita P.,Teng-Jui,Markita P.","Over 88% of biological research articles use bar graphs, of which 29% have undocumented data distortion mistakes that over- or under-state findings. We developed a framework to quantify data distortion and analyzed bar graphs published across 3387 articles in 15 journals, finding consistent data distortions across journals and common biological data types. To reduce bar graph-induced data distortion, we propose recommendations to improve data visualization literacy and guidelines for effective data visualization."
Energy-based Modelling of Single Actin Filament Polymerisation Using Bond Graphs,"Peter,Michael,Vijay,Peter,Michael,Vijay,Peter,Michael,Vijay","Bond graphs provide an energy-based methodology for modelling complex systems in a hierarchical fashion; at the moment, the method allows biological system with both chemical and electrical subsystems to be modelled. Herein, the bond graph approach is extended to include chemomechanical transduction thus extending the range of biological systems to be modelled.
Actin filament polymerisation and force generation is used as an example of chemomechanical transduction and it is shown that the TF (transformer) bond graph component provides a practical, and conceptually simple, alternative to the Brownian ratchet approach of Peskin, Odell, Oster & Mogilner. Furthermore it is shown that the bond graph approach leads to the same equation as the Brownian ratchet approach in the simplest case.
The approach is illustrated by showing that flexibility and non-normal incidence can be modelled by simply adding additional bond graph components and that compliance leads to non-convexity of the force-velocity curve.
Energy flows are fundamental to life; for this reason, the energy based approach is utilised to investigate the power transmission by the actin filament and its corresponding efficiency.
The bond graph model is fitted to experimental data by adjusting model physical parameters."

In primary but not metastatic melanoma biopsies, the burden of coding mutations in desmosome genes associates with a strong reduction in desmosome gene expression. Analysis by spatial transcriptomics and protein immunofluorescence suggests that these expression decreases occur in keratinocytes in the microenvironment rather than in primary melanoma cells. In further support of a microenvironmental origin, we find that desmosome gene knockdown in keratinocytes yields markedly increased proliferation of adjacent melanoma cells in keratinocyte/melanoma co-cultures. Similar increases in melanoma proliferation are observed in media preconditioned by desmosome-deficient keratinocytes. Thus, gradual accumulation of desmosome mutations in neighboring cells may prime melanoma cells for neoplastic transformation."
Equity in Action: A Four-Year journey towards Gender Parity and Racial Diversity in Biochemistry Hiring,"Sherri L,Valerie,Scott,Amy,Mark D,Sherri L,Valerie,Scott,Amy,Mark D,Sherri L,Valerie,Scott,Amy,Mark D","Recruitment of faculty members in academic departments shapes the department for decades in both research and teaching arenas. Having a diverse department is beneficial for undergraduate and graduate students as representation of underrepresented minority groups in the professoriate can inspire a greater diversity of students to pursue higher levels of education or research-focused careers. Increased diversity benefits research directly as diverse teams have been shown to have better ideas and outcomes. In 2020, our department had lower gender diversity than would be expected based on the pool of PhD students and post-doctoral fellows in Canada. Therefore, we altered our hiring process, primarily by redacting applications, for recruitment into entry-level tenure-track faculty positions. With this change in process, female hires increased from 17% in the previous ten years (5 hires) to 80% in the subsequent four years (5 hires) with no substantial change in hiring of racially diverse individuals (50% to 40%). Overall, combined with retirements, the percentage of female faculty in the department went from 25% to 50% and the percentage of racialized faculty went from 38% to 44%. The new hires have met or exceeded expectations of success with respect to grant funding and are on track to meet or exceed expectations for other metrics of success. Thus, our intervention was very successful in increasing the diversity of our department within a short timeframe. We believe that our experience could provide other departments with a template for making substantive change, even in the absence of internal expertise in the area."
Genome and tissue-specific transcriptome of the tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica),"Honglin,Jing,Adrian F,Gretta L,Lily,Ethan,Fumin,Steven B,Georg,Susan R,Honglin,Jing,Adrian F,Gretta L,Lily,Ethan,Fumin,Steven B,Georg,Susan R,Honglin,Jing,Adrian F,Gretta L,Lily,Ethan,Fumin,Steven B,Georg,Susan R","Tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica) serves as a host plant for monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) and other insect herbivores that can tolerate the abundant cardiac glycosides that are characteristic of this species. Cardiac glycosides, along with additional specialized metabolites, also contribute to the ethnobotanical uses of A. curassavica. To facilitate further research on milkweed metabolism, we assembled the 197 Mbp genome of a fifth-generation inbred line of A. curassavica into 619 contigs, with an N50 of 10 Mbp. Scaffolding resulted in 98% of the assembly being anchored to 11 chromosomes, which are mostly colinear with the previously assembled common milkweed (A. syriaca) genome. Assembly completeness evaluations showed that 98% of the BUSCO gene set is present in the A. curassavica genome assembly. The transcriptomes of six tissue types (young leaves, mature leaves, stems, flowers, buds, and roots), with and without defense elicitation by methyl jasmonate treatment, showed both tissue-specific gene expression and induced expression of genes that may be involved in cardiac glycoside biosynthesis. Expression of a CYP87A gene, the predicted first gene in the cardiac glycoside biosynthesis pathway, was observed only in the stems and roots and was induced by methyl jasmonate. Together, this genome sequence and transcriptome analysis provide important resources for further investigation of the ecological and medicinal uses of A. curassavica."
Features and signals in precocious citation impact: a meta-research study,"John,John,John","Some scientists reach top citation impact in a very short time once they start publishing. The current analysis defined precocious citation impact as rising to become a top-cited scientist within t≤8 years after the first publication year. Ultra-precocious citation impact was defined similarly for t ≤5 years. Top-cited authors included those in the top-2% of a previously validated composite citation indicator across 174 subfields of science or in the top-100,000 authors of that composite citation indicator across all science based on Scopus. Annual data between 2017 and 2023 show a strong increase over time, with 469 precocious and 66 ultra-precocious citation impact Scopus author IDs in 2023. In-depth assessment of validated ultra-precocious scientists in 2023, showed significantly higher frequency of less developed country affiliation (71%), clustering in 4 high-risk subfields (Environmental Sciences, Energy, Artificial Intelligence & Image Processing, Mechanical Engineering & Transports) (64%), self-citations for their field  above the 95th percentile (31%), being top-cited only when self-citations were included (20%), citations to citing papers ratio for their field above the 95th percentile (15%), extreme publishing behavior (7%), and extreme citation orchestration metric c/h2<2.45 (15%) compared with all top-cited authors (p<0.005 for all signals). The 17 ultra-precocious citation impact authors in the 2017-2020 top-cited lists who had retractions by October 2024 showed on average 4 of these 7 signal indicators at the time they entered the top-cited list. While some authors with precocious citation impact may be stellar scientists, others probably herald massive manipulative or fraudulent behaviors infiltrating the scientific literature."

The DNA extraction with magnetic nanoparticles accommodates these demands by providing a method that is safe, simple, and yet able to give good purity. The purity parameter of the extracted DNA is based on the A260/280 value. This meta-analysis aims to find variables that can affect the purity of extracted DNA using magnetic nanoparticles, based on its extraction and particle synthesis procedure. The information to be analyzed is from DNA extraction from human blood, plasmid extraction, and E. coli gDNA extraction. The research begins with a systematic review to collect appropriate studies and analysis will be carried out using Minitab to find variables that affect the purity of DNA, either positive or negative. Here we show, that no variables have been found significant to the purity of the extracted DNA in both the DNA extraction procedure steps and reagents. For the magnetic nanoparticle synthesis method, for extraction of , gDNA, coating agent TEOS/TiO,; CoZnFe,O, magnetic nanoparticles, and the interaction between CoZnFe,O, and TEOS are found to be variables that influence the purity of the extracted DNA based on A260/280. Hopefully, this information can be used as a development idea, either for the magnetic nanoparticle synthesis procedure or the selection of reagents and DNA extraction procedures. In addition, the results of this analysis can also be used for consideration in an in-house magnetic nanoparticle-based DNA extraction assembly."
GCS-H2 is essential for growth as it acts as the main relay for mitochondrial lipoylation in heterotrophic tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana,"jonathan,Clement,Marta,Saleh,Katharina,Aurelien,hans,Hermann,Alisdair R,Olivier,jonathan,Clement,Marta,Saleh,Katharina,Aurelien,hans,Hermann,Alisdair R,Olivier,jonathan,Clement,Marta,Saleh,Katharina,Aurelien,hans,Hermann,Alisdair R,Olivier","H-protein is part of the multi-protein glycine cleavage system found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains three loci for genes encoding H-protein. We show that in land plants, there are two clades of mitochondrial H-proteins; one that clusters with H1 and H3, and another that clusters with H2, an isoform mostly expressed in heterotrophic tissue and for which a null mutation results in a >99% impeded growth. After showing that all three isoforms fulfill the same metabolic function, we evidenced that the impaired root growth in h2 results from an altered cell cycle progression concomitant to a lower Target Of Rapamycin kinase activity. Subsequent metabolomic approaches revealed an accumulation of storage sugars and a significant decrease of the TCA intermediates and several vitamins in the h2 root cells as compared to the wild-type ones. 
Additional investigations evidenced that H2 acts as the main relay for lipoylation in root mitochondria, which diverges from the current lipoylation model proposed for photosynthetic tissues. Together, this work provides new insight on the control of the cell cycle by mitochondrial metabolism, and also challenges the current dogma for lipoylation in mitochondria of plant cells."
Artificial Intelligence’s Contribution to Biomedical Literature Search: Revolutionizing or Complicating?,"Rui,Young Joo,Alexander G.,Vinit B.,Rui,Young Joo,Alexander G.,Vinit B.,Rui,Young Joo,Alexander G.,Vinit B.","There is a growing number of articles about conversational AI (i.e., ChatGPT) for generating scientific literature reviews and summaries. Yet, comparative evidence lags its wide adoption by many clinicians and researchers. We explored ChatGPT’s utility for literature search from an end-user perspective through the lens of clinicians and biomedical researchers. We quantitatively compared basic versions of ChatGPT’s utility against conventional search methods such as Google and PubMed. We further tested whether ChatGPT user-support tools (i.e., plugins, web-browsing function, prompt-engineering, and custom-GPTs) could improve its response across four common and practical literature search scenarios: (,) high-interest topics with an abundance of information, (,) niche topics with limited information, (,) scientific hypothesis generation, and (,) for newly emerging clinical practices questions. Our results demonstrated that basic ChatGPT functions had limitations in consistency, accuracy, and relevancy. User-support tools showed improvements, but the limitations persisted. Interestingly, each literature search scenario posed different challenges: an abundance of secondary information sources in high interest topics, and uncompelling literatures for new/niche topics. This study tested practical examples highlighting both the potential and the pitfalls of integrating conversational AI into literature search processes, and underscores the necessity for rigorous comparative assessments of AI tools in scientific research."
Glutathione accelerates the cell cycle and cellular reprogramming in plant regeneration,"Laura R,Bruno,Ramin,Chanel,Bénédicte,Crisanto,Kenneth D,Laura R,Bruno,Ramin,Chanel,Bénédicte,Crisanto,Kenneth D,Laura R,Bruno,Ramin,Chanel,Bénédicte,Crisanto,Kenneth D","The plasticity of plant cells underlies their wide capacity to regenerate, with increasing evidence in plants and animals implicating cell cycle dynamics in cellular reprogramming. To investigate the cell cycle during cellular reprogramming, we developed a comprehensive set of cell cycle phase markers in the Arabidopsis root. Using single-cell RNA-seq profiles and live imaging during regeneration, we found that a subset of cells near an ablation injury dramatically increases division rate by truncating G1. Cells in G1 undergo a transient nuclear peak of glutathione (GSH) prior to coordinated entry into S phase followed by rapid divisions and cellular reprogramming. A symplastic block of the ground tissue impairs regeneration, which is rescued by exogenous GSH. We propose a model in which GSH from the outer tissues is released upon injury licensing an exit from G1 near the wound to induce rapid cell division and reprogramming."

Functional study of Phaeodactylum tricornutum Seipin homolog highlights unique features of lipid droplets biogenesis in diatoms.,"Damien,Fabien,Catherine,Mégane,Matteo,Grégory,Pierre-Henri,Valerie,Mathilde,Sylvaine,Chems,Marta,Rachel,Yangmin,Yufang,Hanhua,Olivier,Juliette,Alberto,Eric,Juliette,Damien,Fabien,Catherine,Mégane,Matteo,Grégory,Pierre-Henri,Valerie,Mathilde,Sylvaine,Chems,Marta,Rachel,Yangmin,Yufang,Hanhua,Olivier,Juliette,Alberto,Eric,Juliette,Damien,Fabien,Catherine,Mégane,Matteo,Grégory,Pierre-Henri,Valerie,Mathilde,Sylvaine,Chems,Marta,Rachel,Yangmin,Yufang,Hanhua,Olivier,Juliette,Alberto,Eric,Juliette","Diatoms are a major phylum of microalgae, playing crucial ecological roles. They derive from secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga by an unknown heterotrophic eukaryote, leading to a complex intracellular organization. In response to unfavorable conditions (stress), diatoms store oil in lipid droplets (LD), raising interest for applications, in particular biofuels. In spite of numerous investigations aiming to increase their oil content, LD biogenesis mechanisms in these organisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we functionally characterized the homolog of Seipin, a major actor of LD biogenesis, in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. PtSeipin shares conserved structural features with other Seipins, yet presents unique characteristics, that appear common to diatoms and more broadly Stramenopiles. We provide evidence that Stramenopiles Seipins were inherited from the host during secondary endosymbiosis. The localization of PtSeipin highlights that LD biogenesis can arise simultaneously from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plastid's most external membrane. Finally, the knock-out of PtSeipin leads to a strong increase of TAG accumulation, a feature that is not observed in other organisms and is greatly enhanced following high light exposure. Our results suggest a redirection of lipid fluxes towards TAG synthesis, reduced TAG recycling or a combination of both."
Three cytochrome P450 enzymes catalyse the formation of furanoclerodane precursors in Salvia spp.,"Ruoxi,Haixiu,Yiren,Zhuo,Licheng,Gerhard,Carlo,Cathie,Evangelos,Ruoxi,Haixiu,Yiren,Zhuo,Licheng,Gerhard,Carlo,Cathie,Evangelos,Ruoxi,Haixiu,Yiren,Zhuo,Licheng,Gerhard,Carlo,Cathie,Evangelos","Salvia species native to the Americas are rich in valuable bioactive furanoclerodanes, like the psychoactive salvinorin A found in Salvia divinorum, which is used in treatment of opioid addiction. However, there is relatively little known about their biosynthesis. To address this, we investigated the biosynthesis of salviarin, the simplest furanoclerodane structure in the ornamental sage Salvia splendens. Using a self-organizing map and mutual rank analysis of RNA-seq co-expression data, we identified three cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for converting kolavenol into salviarin precursors, consecutively: annonene, hardwickiic acid and hautriwaic acid. As annonene and hardwickiic acid have also been proposed as intermediates in the biosynthesis of salvinorin A, and to examine our hypothesis for common evolutionary origin of the furanoclerodane pathway between the two Salvia species, we searched for homologous genes in available data for S. divinorum. The enzymes encoded by orthologous genes from S. divinorum displayed kolavenol synthase (SdKLS), annonene synthase (SdANS), and hardwickiic acid synthase (SdHDAS) activity respectively, supporting the view that these are intermediate steps in the biosynthesis of salvinorin A. We investigated the origin of annonene synthase and the role of gene duplication in the evolution of this specific activity. Our work shows how S. splendens can serve as a model species for studying furanoclerodanes biosynthesis in Salvia species, contributes to understanding the evolution of specialized metabolism in plants, and provides new tools to produce salvinorin A in biotechnological chassis."
A comparative analysis between two flax varieties indicates lignan-mediated salt stress adaptiveness,"Anirban Jyoti,Ĺubomír,Matúš,Marek,Eva,Veronika,Ján,Katarína,Anirban Jyoti,Ĺubomír,Matúš,Marek,Eva,Veronika,Ján,Katarína,Anirban Jyoti,Ĺubomír,Matúš,Marek,Eva,Veronika,Ján,Katarína","United Nations predicted forthcoming food scarcity creates an urgency in research to assess and improve agriculturally important plant yield under environmental stress conditions. In this context, lignans are potential defensive substances that accumulate in plants during abiotic stresses. Flax (, L.) is one of the richest lignan source. Plant genotypes differ in lignan contents. Therefore, to draw a correlation between genotype-specific lignan content and plant salinity-adaptiveness, we compared two flax varieties Flanders and Astella, where Flanders has higher lignan contents than Astella. We used a 1-week NaCl stress for the study. Post-stress morphological analyses revealed comparatively higher growth arrest in Flanders, suggesting its energy and resource-saving behaviour than Astella. Salinity-mediated reactive oxygen species production and associated cell damage were relatively greater in Astella than in Flanders. In biochemical stress marker assays, we found comparatively upregulated antioxidants and osmoprotection machinery in Flanders, showing its higher ROS scavenging and cellular protection capabilities than Astella. Moreover, the two-tailed qPCR assay showed comparatively higher upregulation of three lignan biosynthesis-related miRNAs - miR168a, miR399g, and miR828a in stressed Flanders indicating its emphasised involvement of lignans in salt stress mitigation. The results depict the superiority of Flanders in salt stress mitigation over Astella."

We analyzed 105 paired RNA-Seq datasets from resistant or susceptible , cultivars under salt and drought conditions to identify novel stress-responsive genes with common expression changes across these datasets. A meta-analysis identified 10 genes specifically upregulated in resistant cultivars and 12 specifically upregulated in susceptible cultivars under both drought and salt conditions. Furthermore, by comparing previously identified stress-responsive genes in ,, we explored genes potentially involved in stress response mechanisms that are conserved across plant species. The genes identified in this data-driven study may serve as targets for future research and genome editing."

This study investigates the potential of Moringa oleifera seeds as a low-cost protein source to address protein energy malnutrition. Moringa oleifera seeds were defatted using solvent and used in formulating diets for PEM-induced Wistar rats. The study analyzed the seeds' phytochemical constituents, proximate composition, amino acid profiles, and bioactive compounds through Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS). 20 Rats were randomly assigned to four groups: A=control, B= PEM, C= malnourished rats treated with 15% soya bean based-diet and D= malnourished rats  treated with 15% defatted Moringa oleifera seed-based diet. The results show that defatting increased protein content and reduced anti-nutritional factors like oxalates, saponins, and tannins, enhancing nutrient bioavailability. Defatted Moringa oleifera seed-based diets improved liver and kidney functions, lipid profiles, and protein digestibility in protein energy malnutrition-induced rats. Additionally, the seeds contained essential bioactive compounds with potential antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. These findings suggest that Moringa oleifera seeds could be a promising alternative protein source for combating protein energy malnutrition"
Highly expressed cell wall genes contribute to robustness of sepal size,"Diego A,Mathilde,Nelly,Françoise,Arezki A,Diego A,Mathilde,Nelly,Françoise,Arezki A,Diego A,Mathilde,Nelly,Françoise,Arezki A","Reproducibility in organ size and shape is a fascinating trait of living organisms. The mechanisms underlying such robustness remain, however, to be elucidated. Taking the sepal of Arabidopsis as a model, we investigated whether variability of gene expression plays a role in variation of organ morphology. Previous work from our team identified cell-wall related genes as being enriched among the genes whose expression is highly variable. We then hypothesized that the variation of measured morphological parameters in cell-wall related single knockout mutants could be correlated with the variation in gene expression of the corresponding gene (the knocked-out gene) in wild-type plants. We analyzed sepal morphology from 16 cell-wall mutants and found that, unexpectedly, the higher a gene is expressed in wild type, the more variable the size of the corresponding mutant. These findings support a contribution of cell-wall related genes to the robustness of sepal size."
Reconstructing signaling history of single cells with imaging-based molecular recording,"Kai,Mykel,Zainalabedin,Amirhossein,Yuka,Amjad,Kai,Mykel,Zainalabedin,Amirhossein,Yuka,Amjad,Kai,Mykel,Zainalabedin,Amirhossein,Yuka,Amjad","The intensity and duration of biological signals encode information that allows a few pathways to regulate a wide array of cellular behaviors. Despite the central importance of signaling in biomedical research, our ability to quantify it in individual cells over time remains limited. Here, we introduce INSCRIBE, an approach for reconstructing signaling history in single cells using endpoint fluorescence images. By regulating a CRISPR base editor, INSCRIBE generates mutations in genomic target sequences, at a rate proportional to signaling activity. The number of edits is then recovered through a novel ratiometric readout strategy, from images of two fluorescence channels. We engineered human cell lines for recording WNT and BMP pathway activity, and demonstrated that INSCRIBE faithfully recovers both the intensity and duration of signaling. Further, we used INSCRIBE to study the variability of cellular response to WNT and BMP stimulation, and test whether the magnitude of response is a stable, heritable trait. We found a persistent memory in the BMP pathway. Progeny of cells with higher BMP response levels are likely to respond more strongly to a second BMP stimulation, up to 3 weeks later. Together, our results establish a scalable platform for genetic recording and , readout of signaling history in single cells, advancing quantitative analysis of cell-cell communication during development and disease."

However, producing stable transgenic plants for plants such as soybean is a laborious and time-consuming process, which can impede research progress. Composite plants consisting of wild-type shoots and transgenic roots are an alternative method for generating transgenic plant tissues that can facilitate functional analysis of genes-of-interest involved in root development or root-microbe interactions. In this report, we introduce a novel set of GATEWAY-compatible vectors that enable a wide range of molecular biology uses in roots of soybean composite plants. These vectors incorporate in-frame epitope fusions of green fluorescent protein, 3x-HA, or miniTurbo-ID, which can be easily fused to a gene-of-interest using the GATEWAY cloning system. Moreover, these vectors allow for the identification of transgenic roots using either mCherry fluorescence or the RUBY marker. We demonstrate the functionality of these vectors by expressing subcellular markers in soybean, providing evidence of their effectiveness in generating protein fusions in composite soybean plants. Furthermore, we show how these vectors can be used for gene function analysis by expressing the bacterial effector, AvrPphB in composite roots, enabling the identification of soybean targets via immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. Additionally, we demonstrate the successful expression of stable miniTurbo-ID fusion proteins in composite roots. Overall, this new set of vectors is a powerful tool that can be used to assess subcellular localization and perform gene function analyses in soybean roots without the need to generate stable transgenic plants."
Evolution and theft: loss of state transitions in Bryopsidales macroalgae and photosynthetic sea slugs,"Vesa,Axelle,Heta,Esa,Paulo,Sónia,Vesa,Axelle,Heta,Esa,Paulo,Sónia,Vesa,Axelle,Heta,Esa,Paulo,Sónia","Green macroalgae within the order Bryopsidales lack the fundamental photoprotective mechanisms of green algae, the xanthophyll cycle and energy-dependent dissipation of excess light. Here, by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence at 77K after specific light treatments, we show that Bryopsidales algae also lack state transitions, another ubiquitous photoprotection mechanism present in other green algae. Certain Sacoglossa sea slugs can feed on Ulvophyceae algae, including some Bryopsidales, and steal chloroplasts -kleptoplasts- that remain functional inside the animal cells for months without the support of the algal nucleus. Our data reveal that the state transition capacity is not retained in the kleptoplasts of the sea slugs, and we provide evidence that the loss is caused by structural changes during their incorporation by the animals. This enforced chloroplast sphericity was observed in all studied kleptoplastic associations, and we propose that it is a fundamental property supporting long-term retention of kleptoplasts in photosynthetic sea slugs."

In land plants, successful cytokinesis requires precise targeting of Golgi-derived vesicles to the future division plane by the phragmoplast, a cytoskeletal structure that undergoes continuous remodelling. Endomembrane trafficking and phragmoplast remodelling are tightly coupled, indicating the existence of active crosstalk. However, although many molecular regulators of membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal organisation are known, it remains poorly understood how these processes are co-ordinated. Here, we describe a regulatory module consisting of the membrane-associated GTPase RAB-A2a, cytoskeleton-associated Class II Kinesin-12s, and the Fused kinase orthologue TIO. We provide evidence that the interaction between these molecules at the midzone is essential for cytokinesis in Arabidopsis through simultaneously targeting to the midzone and coupling phragmoplast remodelling to vesicle delivery."

Sesame yield improvement using molecular-biotechnological tools involving gene manipulation is a better alternative than traditional breeding because it requires less time, effort, and labour. Protoplasts are plant cells devoid of the cell wall. Protoplast systems are deployed as versatile cell-based tools for tissue culture, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenetics studies leading to crop improvement. Inadequate reports of sesame protoplasts restrict its potential use in this crop. In the present study, we are reporting the successful isolation and purification of sesame protoplasts from four different sesame explants: hypocotyl, internode, leaf, and hypocotyl-derived callus using the one-step enzymatic digestion method. We have carefully optimised enzyme combinations, digestion durations, temperatures, and shaking speeds for every tested explant to obtain the highest protoplast yield and viability. Maximum yield (9.9 x 10, protoplasts/gm fresh weight) and viability (92.1%) were achieved from callus explants. We purified isolated protoplasts by floating them over a 20% (w/v) sucrose solution. Among tested media, callus-derived protoplasts divided rapidly in Murashige and Skoog broth medium supplemented with 17.77 μM 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 0.54 μM α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). In the same medium, protoplasts divided into the 2-cell stage after 2-3 days of culture and progressed to the micro-callus stage at 0.24 ± 0.05% frequency within 16-20 days of culture. Sesame protoplasts could be an excellent system for investigating potential avenues for biotechnological improvements of sesame including transient gene expression and CRISPR-based studies."
New QTLs involved in the control of stigma position in tomato,"Alessandro,Fabrizio,Barbara,Frederique,Isidore Ambroise,Yolande,Salvador,Maria,Jaime,Antonio J,Antonio,Mathilde,Andrea,Alessandro,Fabrizio,Barbara,Frederique,Isidore Ambroise,Yolande,Salvador,Maria,Jaime,Antonio J,Antonio,Mathilde,Andrea,Alessandro,Fabrizio,Barbara,Frederique,Isidore Ambroise,Yolande,Salvador,Maria,Jaime,Antonio J,Antonio,Mathilde,Andrea","The tomato mating system was strongly affected by domestication events. Mutations disrupting self-incompatibility paralleled by changes retracting the stigma position (SP) within the staminal cone conferred strict autogamy and self-fertility to the cultivated forms. Although major genes affecting these changes have been identified, SP control in domesticated forms retaining a non-inserted or a heat-inducible SP needs elucidation. To widen the possibility of identifying SP genetic determinants, we analysed the trait in four populations (two germplasm collections, a multiparental recombinant inbred and a biparental progeny) under different environmental conditions (normal and heat stressed). Overall, 36 markers significantly associated with the trait were discovered. Several co-localizations were found, both among regions firstly reported in this work and among them and previously reported positions. This supported the reliability of the analysis. Three of such regions, in the long arms of chromosome 1, 8 and 11, were validated in an independent segregating population and candidate genes in confidence intervals were identified among transcription factors and hormone, stress and cell-wall-related genes. In conclusion, the work supported the hypothesis that the SP phenotype is controlled by different key-genes in tomato, paving the way to identifying novel players and novel mechanisms involved in the regulation of herkogamy."
ABI5 Binding Proteins are substrates of key components in the ABA core signaling pathway,"Ruth R.,Tim,B. Joy,Teodora,Jonas,Ruth R.,Tim,B. Joy,Teodora,Jonas,Ruth R.,Tim,B. Joy,Teodora,Jonas","The central components of the ABA core signaling pathway are families of receptors, clade A type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), SNF1-Related Protein Kinases (SnRK2s), and diverse sets of proteins regulated by phosphorylation via these kinases, including bZIP transcription factors such as ABA-INSENSITIVE(ABI)5. The larger network of ABA signaling factors includes additional kinases and E3 ligases that modify these components to affect their activity and stability. The ABI5-Binding Proteins (AFPs) are negative regulators of ABA response. This study shows that the AFPs interact with specific family members of all components of this pathway and are substrates for SnRK2s and PP2Cs. AFPs also interact with subsets of MAP kinases (MPKs) and 14-3-3 proteins previously found to regulate activity of the ABI5-related clade of transcription factors. Residues predicted to be phosphorylated are conserved between AFPs, but are located within regions predicted to be unstructured. ABA promotes phosphorylation of AFP2, but conditions that prevent phosphorylation of AFP2 result in decreased stability, a shift in localization toward dispersed foci, and reduced effectiveness for inhibiting ABA response at germination. Thus, AFP2 appears to be an important hub in the ABA core signaling pathway."

Willow,Daichi,Hideki,Daniel A.,Tomoaki,Baoyu,Satoshi,Shin-ichiro M.,Takanari","Motility is a hallmark of life′s dynamic processes, enabling cells to actively chase prey, repair wounds, and shape organs. Recreating these intricate behaviors using well-defined molecules remains a major challenge at the intersection of biology, physics, and molecular engineering. Although the polymerization force of the actin cytoskeleton is characterized as a primary driver of cell motility, recapitulating this process in protocellular systems has proven elusive. The difficulty lies in the daunting task of distilling key components from motile cells and integrating them into model membranes in a physiologically relevant manner. To address this, we developed a method to optically control actin polymerization with high spatiotemporal precision within cell-mimetic lipid vesicles known as giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Within these active protocells, the reorganization of actin networks triggered outward membrane extensions as well as the unidirectional movement of GUVs at speeds of up to 0.43 μm/min, comparable to typical adherent mammalian cells. Notably, our findings reveal a synergistic interplay between branched and linear actin forms in promoting membrane protrusions, highlighting the cooperative nature of these cytoskeletal elements. This approach offers a powerful platform for unraveling the intricacies of cell migration, designing synthetic cells with active morphodynamics, and advancing bioengineering applications, such as self-propelled delivery systems and autonomous tissue-like materials."

Aphids are one of the biggest group of ectotherms that transmit viruses to plants; more than 200 species have been identified as pathogen vectors. These aphids are responsible for transmitting over 300 viruses. The life-history traits of aphids such as fecundity and survival respond strongly and non-linearly to temperature and therefore to global warming. In this study, we elaborate the thermal responses for the main life-history traits (i.e, development and mortality rate) for aphid species for which data were available or generated. Also, thermal responses for virus transmission rates were elaborated to describe plant host to vector and vector to plant host dynamics. With these data, we elaborated thermal suitability models which were used to map current and projected scenarios for the transmission of viruses by aphids. Data was only available/generated for 19 aphid species, many of which only have data either at the lower or upper thermal limits. For virus transmission rates, from host plant to vector and from vector to plant data was only available/generated for potato virus Y (PVY), potato virus A (PVA), and potato leaf roll virus (PLRV) transmitted by the aphid ,. Projections show that virus transmission by aphids will shift to northern latitudes. Understanding the thermal biology of aphids is crucial for developing effective measures to safeguard agriculture, especially staple crops, and food security in the context of climate change."

Further characterization and engineering of a 11-amino acid motif for enhancing recombinant protein expression,"Jiawu,Elaine,Weibiao,Fong Tian,Jiawu,Elaine,Weibiao,Fong Tian,Jiawu,Elaine,Weibiao,Fong Tian","Background: Recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a widely used system in both academic and industrial research owing to its low cost and wide availability of genetic tools. Despite its advantages, this system still struggles with soluble expression of recombinant proteins. To address this, various solubility-enhancing and yield-improving methods such as the addition of fusion tags have been developed. However, traditional tags such as small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) and Glutathione S-transferase (GST) can interfere with protein folding or require removal post-translation, which adds complexity and cost to production. To circumvent these issues, smaller solubility tags (<10 kDa) are preferred. This study specifically focuses on an 11-amino acid solubility-enhancing tag (NT11) derived from the N-terminal domain of a duplicated carbonic anhydrase from Dunaliella species. Results: A comprehensive analysis was performed to improve the characteristics of the 11-amino acid tag. By investigating the alanine-scan library of NT11, we increased its activity and identified key residues for further development. Screening with the alanine mutant library consistently led to at least a two-fold improvement in protein yield for three different proteins. We also discovered that the NT11 tag is not limited to the N-terminal position and can function at either the N- or C-terminal of the protein, providing flexibility in designing protein expression constructs. With these new insights, we have successfully doubled the recombinant protein yields of valuable growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and an originally low-yielding human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), in E. coli. Conclusion: The further characterisation and development of the NT11 tag have provided valuable insights into the optimization process for such small tags and expanded our understanding of its potential applications. The ability of NT11 tag to be positioned at different locations within the protein construct without compromising its effectiveness to enhance recombinant protein yields, makes it a valuable tool across a diverse range of proteins. Collectively, these findings have the potential to simplify and enhance the efficiency of recombinant protein production."
Four cell wall-degrading enzymes of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris determine bacterial escape from hydathodes to the leaf vasculature,"Misha,Marcel,Sebastian,Harrold A,Misha,Marcel,Sebastian,Harrold A,Misha,Marcel,Sebastian,Harrold A","To colonize plants, pathogenic bacteria modulate the biology of the host employing different bacterial secretion systems. For example, the type II secretion system (T2SS) releases toxins, proteases, lipases and carbohydrate-degrading enzymes into the extracellular environment to promote tissue softening and soft rot. In this way, the T2SS promotes virulence of phytopathogenic Gram-negative bacteria.  However, the role of the T2SS and its substrates for vascular disease remains enigmatic. Here, we show that the Xps-T2SS allows Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) to breach the tissue barrier between hydathodes - the initial bacterial entry point - and xylem thereby gaining access to the leaf vasculature. Yet, Xps-T2SS was dispensable for bacterial multiplication in the leaf apoplast or inside the hydathode cavity suggesting a role beyond plant defense suppression or nutrient acquisition. Using comparative genomics, four plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) were found to be associated with vascular pathogenesis. Testing gene knockout combinations of those enzymes revealed that virulence of only the quadruple CWDE mutant was down to the level of the xps-T2SS mutant. Our results thus demonstrate that the Xps-T2SS and a set of CWDEs that is likely secreted by this system allow Xcc to break this tissue barrier enabling long-distance mobility of Xcc inside the host plant. We thus expand our understanding on how certain bacterial pathogens have specialized towards vascular pathogens."
The polyketide pathway in sporopollenin biosynthesis is specific to land plants (Embryophyta),"Dae-Yeon,Damanpreet K,Neil W,Dae-Yeon,Damanpreet K,Neil W,Dae-Yeon,Damanpreet K,Neil W","Sporopollenin (SP) is a complex biopolymer in the outer cell wall of spores and pollen and provides protection from environmental stresses. Its extraordinary biological and chemical resistance has defied efforts to elucidate its chemical composition and structure. This led to the adoption of broad and imprecise definitions of SP, which encouraged claims for its widespread occurrence among diverse embryophyte and non-embryophyte taxa and also misguided research on the evolution of SP and its roles during terrestrialisation. We previously proposed a more precise biochemical definition that can be used as a diagnostic tool to distinguish genuine SP from other chemically resistant cell wall materials. The definition was centred on the possession of ASCL (Anther-Specific Chalcone synthase-Like), an embryophyte-specific enzyme of the polyketide pathway that provides precursors for SP biosynthesis. Herein, we demonstrate that all five enzymes (CYP703, CYP704, ACOS, ASCL and TKPR) of the polyketide pathway are present in embryophytes but absent in green algae and propose a new, more comprehensive definition of SP: ""Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant complex heteropolymer present in the outer walls of spores and pollen grains and is composed partly of hydroxylated polyketides derived from the conserved polyketide pathway, which typically involves CYP703A, CYP704B, ACOS, ASCL and TKPR."" Furthermore, we examine the evolution of all five enzymes of the polyketide pathway from ancestral enzymes of primary metabolism. We discuss the co-selection of ACOS, ASCL and TKPR and also provide evidence that gene dosage of all five genes in the pathway has been subjected to strict evolutionary control. This study further signifies SP as an evolutionary innovation unique to the embryophyte lineage and encourages research on possible evolutionary relationships between genuine embryophyte SP and other 'SP-like materials' in reproductive bodies including algal zygospores and dinoflagellate cysts."

We analyzed 200 genomes of the perennial herb woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca L.) from across Europe and investigated the population structure and demographic history of the species during past geoclimatic events. We found a clear division of populations into western and eastern genetic clusters, indicative of distinct glacial refugia and adaptations to variation in temperature seasonality. The eastern core populations were several times larger (defined as effective population size, NE) than populations in other regions, showed no evidence of inbreeding, and were resilient to several glacial maxima. However, we observed decreasing NE and higher inbreeding in populations toward range edges, particularly in the north, where these individuals went through bottlenecks during glaciations. Population divergence suggested that western and eastern Europe were colonized from separate refugia in multiple waves during the Holocene, while the largest current populations from the northern Mediterranean to southern regions of the Nordic countries formed a connected population chain with gene flow between eastern core populations and western Europe, primarily occurring through Central Europe. Similar patterns of colonization and hybridization may have occurred during past interglacial periods, contributing to the present-day population structure of woodland strawberry. We suggest that the unprecedented resolution of the species climatic history across six glacial-interglacial cycles presented here holds the promise of transforming the general understanding of species paleohistory through geoclimatically tracing ancestral haplotypes."
Back to the Future: Environmental genomic selection to take advantage of polygenic local adaptation,"Anna,Quinn,Sonia,Peter L,Sariel,Jeffrey,Michael Benjamin,Anna,Quinn,Sonia,Peter L,Sariel,Jeffrey,Michael Benjamin,Anna,Quinn,Sonia,Peter L,Sariel,Jeffrey,Michael Benjamin","The genetic basis of adaptation is a fundamental question in evolutionary genetics. Environmental association analysis (EAA) and various allele frequency comparisons in genomic environmental association (GEA) have become standard approaches for investigating the genetic basis of adaptation to natural environments. While these analyses provide insight into local adaptation, they have not been widely adopted in breeding or conservation programs. This may be attributable to the difficulty in identifying the best individuals for transplantation/relocation in conservation efforts or identification of the best parents in breeding programs. To explore the use of EAA and GEA for future breeding programs, we used a cereal crop - barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) as our case-study species due to its wide adaptability to different environments and agro-ecologies, ranging from marginal and low input fields to high-productive farms. Here, we use publicly available data to conduct environmental genomic selection (EGS) on 753 landrace barley accessions using a mini-core of 31 landrace accessions and a de-novo core of 100 as the training populations. Environmental genomic selection is to environmental association analysis (EAA) what genomic selection is to genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Since local adaptation to the environment is polygenic, a whole-genome approach is likely to be more accurate for selecting for environmental adaptation. Here we show distinct genetic background and population differences and how an integrative approach coupling environmental genomic selection and species distribution modelling can help identify key parents for breeding for adaptation to specific environmental variables and geographies to minimize linkage drag."
Wax bloom dynamics on Sorghum bicolor under different environmental stresses reveal signaling modules associated with wax production,"Madison,Marshall,Lucas,Madison,Marshall,Lucas,Madison,Marshall,Lucas","Epicuticular wax blooms are associated with improved drought resistance in many species, including Sorghum bicolor. While the role of wax in drought resistance is well known, we report new insights into how light and drought dynamically influence wax production. We investigated how wax quantity and composition are modulated over time and in response to different environmental stressors, as well as the molecular and genetic mechanisms involved in such. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and photographic results showed that sorghum leaf sheath wax load and composition were altered in mature plants grown under drought and simulated shade, though this phenomenon appears to vary by sorghum cultivar. We combined an in vitro wax induction protocol with GC-MS and RNA-seq measurements to identify a draft signaling pathway for wax bloom induction in sorghum. We also explored the potential of spectrophotometry to aid in monitoring wax bloom dynamics. Spectrophotometric analysis showed primary differences in reflectance between bloom-rich and bloomless tissue surfaces in the 230-500nm range of the spectrum, corresponding to the blue color channel of photographic data. Our smartphone-based system detected significant differences in wax production between control and shade treatment groups, demonstrating its potential for candidate screening. Overall, our data suggest that wax extrusion can be rapidly modulated in response to light, occurring within days compared to the months required for the changes observed under greenhouse drought/simulated shade conditions. These results highlight the dynamic nature of wax modulation in response to varying environmental stimuli, especially light and water availability."

The aim of the research was to determine the resistance of sunflower hybrids to the broomrape parasite. During the research, a vegetation experiment was used to determine the racial composition of the parasite and the resistance of different sunflower hybrids to it. Sunflower hybrids were evaluated for resistance to broomrape in soil culture using a modified method and the roll method of seed germination. From the northern Steppe of Ukraine, broomrape is actively moving to the central, northern and western regions of the country. The practical value of the work is to determine the resistance of sunflower hybrids to broomrape. Differentiation of sunflower hybrids grown by resistance to the parasite was carried out. It has been observed that the broomrape population exhibits a significant level of virulence capable of overcoming the immunity found in the most resilient foreign-bred hybrids resistant to E, F, and G races of this parasite. The appearance of highly aggressive new races of broomrape (E, F, G, and H) in the Forest-Steppe and Polissya regions underscores the crucial necessity to address the challenge of developing breeding material resistant to these novel races of the parasitic plant. This entails an in-depth exploration of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying sunflower resistance to the pathogen. The widespread buildup of parasite races E, F, G, and H in sunflower crops is linked to the disruption of crop rotations and the extensive cultivation of hybrids of this crop. These hybrids are primarily resistant to races 5 (E) and 6 (F) of the parasite. The results of the research can be used in the region's farms for successful protection against broomrape, as well as in breeding programs to create sunflower hybrids resistant to new races of the parasite and corn hybrids that cause better germination of seeds of this pathogen in the soil and their death by their root secretions.

MMM and CLCFM: A 3D point cloud reconstruction method based on photogrammetry for all-around images taken by rotating an individual plant,"Atsushi,Nobuo,Kunihiro,Sachiko,Takanari,Atsushi,Nobuo,Kunihiro,Sachiko,Takanari,Atsushi,Nobuo,Kunihiro,Sachiko,Takanari","This research proposes a novel technique for acquiring a large amount of high-density, high-precision 3D point cloud data for plants. We propose two methods, multi-masked matching (MMM) and the closed-loop coarse-to-fine method (CLCFM). The proposed approach addresses challenges in reconstructing plant 3D point clouds from all-around images using SfM and multi-view stereo methods. Given the complex structure of plants, with thin objects like leaves and stems overlapping, reconstructing accurate 3D point clouds presents significant challenges. One of these is occlusion, where points in the 3D point cloud cannot be obtained due to overlapping parts, preventing accurate point capture. Another is the generation of erroneous points in non-existent locations due to image matching errors along object outlines. The MMM mitigates these problems through an iterative process that alternates between locally generating point clouds and refining these point clouds by removing erroneous points using mask images. The proposed pipeline enables the construction of plant 3D point clouds with minimal noise and fewer missing points. By facilitating the acquisition of high-density, high-precision 3D data on a large number of plant bodies, as required for research activities, the proposed method is expected to enable comparative analysis of visible phenotypes in the growth process of a wide range of plant species based on 3D information."

Localized Marker Detector (LMD) is a novel tool to identify ""localized genes"" - genes exclusively expressed in groups of highly similar cells - thereby characterizing cellular diversity in a multi-resolution and fine-grained manner. LMD constructs a cell-cell affinity graph, diffuses the gene expression value across the cell graph, and assigns a score to each gene based on its diffusion dynamics. LMD's candidate markers can be grouped into functional gene modules, which accurately reflect cell types, subtypes, and other sources of variation such as cell cycle status. We apply LMD to mouse bone marrow and hair follicle dermal condensate datasets, where LMD facilitates cross-sample comparisons, identifying shared and sample-specific gene signatures and novel cell populations without requiring batch effect correction or integration methods. Furthermore, we assessed the performance of LMD across nine single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, compared it with six other methods aimed at achieving similar objectives, and found that LMD outperforms the other methods evaluated."
Mechanical properties are tuned during development with the fibrous network nature of the Arabidopsis cell wall,"Si,Isabella,Purvil,Bex,Meredith N.,Adrienne H.K.,Si,Isabella,Purvil,Bex,Meredith N.,Adrienne H.K.,Si,Isabella,Purvil,Bex,Meredith N.,Adrienne H.K.","Plant organ growth involves significant deformation of cell walls, with the mechanical behavior of these walls, particularly the epidermal cell walls, playing a crucial role in plant morphogenesis. To gain insights into the mechanics of plant growth, it is vital to study and quantify the large-deformation mechanical properties of the epidermal cell walls in the context of development. To this end, we investigated the mechanical response of the Arabidopsis leaf epidermis to stretching. The epidermis exhibited a non-linear stiffening behavior that naturally fell into three regimes. Each regime also corresponded with distinct nonlinear behaviors in terms of transverse deformation (i.e., Poisson effect) and unrecoverable deformation (i.e., plasticity). We found that these properties arise not from the geometric structure of the epidermal cells but rather from the cell wall material, which behaves as a fibrous network material. Using a five-beam model, we demonstrated that these nonlinear behaviors result from the transition from reorientation and bendingdominated to stretch-dominated deformation modes of cellulose microfibrils. We further explored how these mechanical properties change during development and found stiffening behavior is more pronounced at later developmental stage. Finally, our investigation into the , mutant with altered morphology shows that it has anisotropic mechanical properties, likely contributing to the leaf curvature.

Semi-supervised Omics Factor Analysis (SOFA) disentangles known sources of variation from latent factors in multi-omics data,"Tümay,Harald,Wolfgang,Tümay,Harald,Wolfgang,Tümay,Harald,Wolfgang","Group Factor Analysis is a family of methods for representing patterns of correlation between features in tabular data,. Argelaguet et al. identify latent factors within and across modalities,. Often, some factors align with known covariates, and currently, such alignment is done post hoc. We present Semi-supervised Omics Factor Analysis (SOFA), a method that incorporates known sources of variation into the model and focuses the latent factor discovery on novel sources of variation. We apply it to a pan-gynecologic multi-omics data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), where we guide the model with cancer type labels and discover an independent factor representing an immune infiltration vs proliferation transition axis. The inferred factor is predictive of treatment outcomes. We further use SOFA to identify microglial subpopulations during adolescence associated with cell migration and inflammatory response in a single-cell multi-omics data set (RNA- and ATAC-seq) from the human cerebral cortex. SOFA simplifies the discovery of novel patterns and structures in multi-omics data."
"Critical issues found in ""Dissecting cell identity via network inference and in silico gene perturbation""","Jalil,Antoine,Sven,Jalil,Antoine,Sven,Jalil,Antoine,Sven","In the 2023 Nature publication ""Dissecting cell identity via network inference and in silico gene perturbation"" [1], the authors introduced CellOracle (CO), a novel method leveraging mRNA-seq and ATAC-seq data to construct gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which are subsequently used for gene perturbation. They designed CO to account for the role of distal cis-regulatory elements, e.g. enhancers, as well as proximal promoters in the gene regulation system. For this purpose, they employed Cicero to determine the co-accessibility scores between peaks, provided by ATAC-seq data. These scores are then used to identify the interaction of distal regions with the target gene. Using CO, they have conducted multiple perturbation studies on different organisms and identified novel phenotypes resulting from transcriptional factor (TF) perturbation. In addition, they benchmarked CO's performance using ChIP-seq data as ground truth against other state-of-the-art GRN methods across multiple mouse tissue samples. However, our evaluation reveals critical limitations in the implementation of their methodology, both in terms of ATAC-seq data integration as well as benchmarking. In this report, we first explain the limitations in their approach of integrating ATAC-seq data. We show that the proposed algorithm fails to account for distal regulatory interactions. After, we present the issues associated with their benchmarking algorithm and the data used for benchmarking. We show that their findings regarding the comparative performance of CO against other GRN inference methods is invalid and requires further evaluation. In conclusion, we detect multiple inaccuracies in this paper which undermine the validity of their published protocol and the results.

Refining Protein-Level MicroRNA Target Interactions in Disease from Prediction Databases Using Sentence-BERT,"Baiming,Baiming,Baiming","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by binding to mRNAs, inhibiting translation, or promoting mRNA degradation. miRNAs are of great importance in the development of various diseases. Currently, a variety of miRNA target prediction tools are available, that analyze sequence complementarity, thermodynamic stability, and evolutionary conservation to predict miRNA-target interactions (MTIs) within the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). We propose a concept for further screening of human sequence-based predicted MTIs by considering the disease similarity between miRNAs and genes to establish a prediction database of disease-specific MTIs. We fine-tuned the Sentence-BERT model to calculate the semantic similarity of disease. The method achieved an F1 score of 0.88 in accurately distinguishing human protein-level experimentally (Western Blot, Reporter Assay, etc.) validated MTIs and predicted MTIs. Moreover, this method exhibits exceptional generalizability across different databases. The proposed method was utilized to calculate the similarity of disease in 1,220,904 human MTIs from miRTarbase, miRDB, and miRWalk, involving 6,085 genes and 1,261 pre-miRNAs. The study holds the potential to offer valuable insights into comprehending miRNA-gene regulatory networks and advancing progress in disease diagnosis, treatment, and drug development."

Application of Ensemble Machine Learning to Metabolomic Data Identifies Metabolites Associated with Macrophage Polarization,"Aadi,Rahul,Spyros,Marissa,Lance,Padmanabhan,Aadi,Rahul,Spyros,Marissa,Lance,Padmanabhan,Aadi,Rahul,Spyros,Marissa,Lance,Padmanabhan","Towards developing quantitative models of anti-tumor activities of macrophages, we evaluated the effects of cytokines, tumor exosomes, and polarization states of macrophages in a tumor microenvironemnt using a system of differential equations. We modeled the non-linear dynamics of macrophage polarization states (M0/M1/M2), tumor cell killing by macrophages, and evasion of macrophage mediated killing by tumor originated extracellular vesicle decoys. Solving these coupled differential equations using numerical approaches, showed that the rate of macrophage polarization into the M1 state is the critical determinant of anti-tumor activity mediated by M1 polarized macrophages. To determine what metabolomic factors correlate with the polarization of naive macrophage into anti-tumor M1 or pro-tumor M2 phenotypes, we performed LC/MS-based untargeted metabolomic analysis. Statistical analysis using Python-Scikit-learn was performed on the metabo-lomic data from naive, M1 or M2 polarized murine macrophages followed by multiple feature selection methods. Application of ensemble machine learning methods to both secreted and cell associated metabolites revealed novel molecules of fatty acid metabolism to be the main mediators of polarization. Integration of ensemble machine learning feature-ranking tools into our analysis of metabolomic data identified new potential targets in macrophage metabolism for enhancing anti-tumor activities."
"Influence of Shading on the Behavioral Ecology of a Caribbean Alcyonacean Octocoral, ,, in the Florida Keys, United States","Savannah,Jason D.,Matthew,Savannah,Jason D.,Matthew,Savannah,Jason D.,Matthew","Using a restricted set of behavioral responses, corals must obtain sufficient light to maximize photosynthesis while simultaneously avoiding predation and molecular damage from UV radiation. This study investigates the polyp behavioral response of the Caribbean octocoral , to shading, and how this response influences reactions to a simulated predator cue. In experiment I, we measured changes in polyp extension before and after a shade structure was placed over colonies on a shallow patch reef in the Florida Keys. In experiment II, changes in polyp extension were measured following a simulated predator cue for both shaded and un-shaded colonies. Experiment I demonstrates that , possesses a mechanism for detecting changes in light intensity and responds by manipulating the extension of its polyps. Following polyp retraction due to a predator cue in experiment II, the temporal pattern of polyp re-extension differed between shaded and non-shaded colonies, and at the end of the observation period, shaded colonies had a greater proportion of extended polyps than non-shaded colonies, consistent with the results of experiment I. This research provides novel and valuable insights into the behavior of a common and important Caribbean octocoral and will serve as a foundation for future research pertaining to the physiological processes involved."
Protein Sequence Domain Annotation using Language Models,"Arpan,Kumaresh,Sean R,Arpan,Kumaresh,Sean R,Arpan,Kumaresh,Sean R","Protein function inference relies on annotating protein domains via sequence similarity, often modeled through profile Hidden Markov Models (profile HMMs), which capture evolutionary diversity within related domains. However, profile HMMs make strong simplifying independence assumptions when modeling residues in a sequence. Here, we introduce PSALM (Protein Sequence Annotation using Language Models), a hierarchical approach that relaxes these assumptions and uses representations of protein sequences learned by protein language models to enable high-sensitivity, high-specificity residue-level protein sequence annotation. We also develop the Multi-Domain Protein Homology Benchmark (MDPH-Bench), a benchmark for protein sequence domain annotation, where training and test sequences have been rigorously split to share no similarity between any of their domains at a given threshold of sequence identity. Prior benchmarks, which split one domain family at a time, do not support methods for annotating multi-domain proteins, where training and test sequences need to have multiple domains from different families. We validate PSALM's performance on MDPH-Bench and highlight PSALM as a promising alternative to HMMER, a state-of-the-art profile HMM-based method, for protein sequence annotation."
A hydrodynamic antenna: novel lateral line system in the tail of myliobatid stingrays,"Júlia,George V.,Júlia,George V.,Júlia,George V.","Eagle rays, cownose rays, and manta rays (family Myliobatidae) have a slender tail that can be longer than the animal’s body length, but its function and structure are unknown. Using histology, immunohistochemistry, and 3D imaging with micro-CT scans, we describe the anatomy and function of the tail in ,, the cownose ray. The tail is an extension of the vertebral column with unique morphological specializations. Along the tail behind the barb, vertebral centra are absent and neural and hemal arches fuse and form a solid mineralized structure that we term the caudal synarcual, which imparts passive stiffness to the tail, reducing bending. Two lateral line canals connected to an extensive tubule network extend along both sides of the tail. Tubules branch from the lateral line canal toward the dorsal and ventral tail surfaces and open to the surrounding water via pores. A continuous neuromast is located within each lateral line canal, maintaining an interrupted structure along the entire tail. The complex lateral line mechanosensory system in the tail of , supports the hypothesis that the tail functions like a hydrodynamic sensory antenna and may play an important role in their behavioral and functional ecology."

Yet, detailed information and expertise about a single species are not always available for practitioners to make informed decisions about rearing practices or identify arising issues. The cricket (,) is commonly farmed for human consumption or animal feed, but few studies have characterized the life history of this species throughout ontogeny. Here, we describe the growth and development of , from hatch to adulthood and quantify reproductive traits relevant to mass-rearing and colony management, including egg development.

"Effects of feeding water hyacinth (,) fodder with or without commercial concentrate on zoo-technical performance and profitability in tropical goats and sheep","Yared,Yisehak,Nebiyu,Yared,Yisehak,Nebiyu,Yared,Yisehak,Nebiyu","The utilization of unconventional feed resources, such as water hyacinth is an effective strategy to address feed shortages in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly where access to conventional feeds is limited. In this study, tropical sheep (Doyogena rams) and goats (Woyito-Guji bucks) fed diets containing different amounts of WH were examined for their zoo-technical performance and profitability sing a 2 × 4 × 4 randomized crossover design with two animal species, four nutritional treatments, and four feeding intervals. The dietary treatments consisted of 50% hay + 0% WH + 50% commercial concentrate (CC, T1), 50% hay + 12.5% WH + 37.5% CC (T2), 50% hay + 25% WH + 25% CC (T3), and 50% hay + 37.5% WH + 12.5% CC (T4). The findings showed that compared to goats, sheep had the highest energy and nutrient intake (P<0.001), nutrient digestibility (P<0.001), average daily gain (ADG, g/day), and body weight change (BWC (kg) (P<0.05). Regarding energy and nutritional intake, there was a substantial difference (P < 0.001) between treatment groups for both animal species, with the exception of goats’ consumption of DM, OM, CHO, GE, and ADL (P <0.05). Likewise, significant differences existed between treatment groups for nutritional digestibility, ADG, BWC, and FCE for both species (P <0.001). Moreover, significant interactions (P < 0.005) were seen in all energy and nutrient intake parameters between species and treatment. Furthermore, in tropical sheep and goat breeds, water hyacinth can replace up to 37.5% of the commercial concentrate used for growth and fattening, but it has a major comparative effect on sheep. Feed prices for the T4 group fed sheep and goats were 37.2% and 36.8% lower, respectively, than for the T1 group. Therefore, farmers in the tropics who cannot afford commercial concentrates can still benefit economically by using the dry biomass of water hyacinth in their diet, either with or without it."
Images in red: A methodological and integrative approach for the usage of Near-infrared Hyperspectral Imaging (NIR-HSI) on collection specimens of Orthoptera (Insecta),"Gustavo  Costa,Neirivaldo  Cavalcante,Ana Lúcia  Nunes,José Antônio  Marin,Gustavo  Costa,Neirivaldo  Cavalcante,Ana Lúcia  Nunes,José Antônio  Marin,Gustavo  Costa,Neirivaldo  Cavalcante,Ana Lúcia  Nunes,José Antônio  Marin","Anthropogenic actions have caused severe environmental changes, leading to a rapid and massive loss of biodiversity, called the Holocene Extinction or ""Sixth Extinction."" In this context, integrative methods, capable of quickly and reliably determining and differentiating species, have become constantly demanded in taxonomic studies. Near-infrared spectroscopical technologies have proved to be promising for application in the integrative taxonomy of insects, and it is a true-non-destructive method, causing no damage to the sample and being completely chemical-preparation-free. Near-infrared spectral profiles are known as the fingerprints of the chemical composition of a given sample, and a new layer of information may be accessed. Hyperspectral imaging technologies in the near-infrared range are among the most popular, although their usage is still incipient in insect studies. As in other animal taxa, katydids' taxonomy has traditionally been based on morphological comparison, resulting in many misclassifications over the years. However, integrative methods are more and more required in taxonomic studies. Different methods and technologies have been used from an integrative perspective to minimize misidentifications, especially for non-taxonomist or untrained researchers. Here, we approach the applicability of near-infrared spectroscopy coupled with hyperspectral imaging technology to Ensifera specimens housed in collections, discussing the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges to future applications. As a result, we propose using only homologous body parts in comparing and modeling species using this kind of data due to the heterogeneity of the insects' exoskeleton. Additionally, we made a case study by discriminating four species of the katydid genus Conocephalus Thunberg, one of the most speciose genera within Orthoptera that is known to have polymorphic species, with variations expressed in the wing development and postabdomen appendages. We generated a Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) classification model for the species with an overall classification accuracy for the assigned pixels of 90% and specific accuracy for pixel discrimination ranging from 96% to 98%. This is one of the few research studies employing hyperspectral imaging in insects' taxonomy, and it is the very first to use this technology in Orthoptera; therefore, this is a preliminary approach to usage as an integrative method."

Here we introduce a novel method for detecting , based on the mite’s characteristic biology (reduced feeding as bee pupae mature, brief dispersal phase on adult bees and agility) and the use of wax strips. Sealed worker brood cells at the development stage of white to purple-eyed pupae are swiftly decapped with wax strips to observe and count surfacing adult mites. Our study shows over 90 % detection efficacy and brood survival, and ease of application. Therefore, we recommend the novel “Rapid brood decapping” method as a reliable tool for detecting and monitoring , infestation."
Sperm quality metrics exhibit annual fluctuations in a critically endangered amphibian managed under human care,"Allison R.,Isabella J.,Carrie K.,Diane,Allison R.,Isabella J.,Carrie K.,Diane,Allison R.,Isabella J.,Carrie K.,Diane","The Puerto Rican crested toad (PRCT) is Puerto Rico’s only endemic toad and has undergone rapid population decline within the last 40 years. As a hedge against extinction, captive assurance colonies have been established at several zoological institutions for breeding and reintroduction. However, reproductive output has remained low, despite the use of hormone therapies to attempt to bypass missing abiotic cues and stimulate reproductive behaviors. This low output necessitates a better understanding of natural fluctuations in gamete, specifically sperm, quality in captive individuals. To generate an understanding of natural gametic cycles in captive PRCTs, we administered male PRCTs (n = 86) housed under natural temperature and photoperiod cycles with exogenous hormones monthly for one year. Samples were analyzed for motility and concentration to assess variations in sperm quality by month. Spermiation was successfully stimulated every month, but quality fluctuated; sperm motility was highest in June and July, while sperm concentration was highest in December, January, and March. These results indicate that, while hormones can be utilized to stimulate gamete production in PRCTs year-round, sperm quality is not consistent. Furthermore, the seasonal occurrence of peak sperm production of captive males differed from natural peaks reported for wild PRCTs. Our results illustrate the need for more biologically informed strategies for breeding of at-risk anuran populations."

Optimization of rearing , under laboratory conditions is crucial for further studies of this species to improve their application in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs. Here, we evaluated the development and reproduction of , when fed on four different diets, including cattail pollen (,), living dried fruit mites (,), frozen , eggs, and a mixed diet of frozen , eggs and , pollen. Females consuming the mixed diet exhibited superior total fecundity and daily oviposition rate, along with the highest intrinsic rate of increase (r,) and net productive rate (R,) among all diets tested. The immature period was significantly longer for mites on a diet of living , compared to those on other diets. Importantly, utilizing frozen , eggs and , pollen mitigates the risk of infestation and contamination from the living dried fruit mites, which is important for laboratory and field settings when releasing the predator colonies.

The total diversity of geographic radiations of many Indo-Pacific fauna is often incompletely sampled in phylogenetic studies due to the difficulty in obtaining single island endemic forms across the Pacific and the relatively poor performance of degraded DNA when using museum specimens for inference of evolutionary relationships. New methods for production and analysis of genome-wide datasets sourced from degraded DNA are facilitating insights into the complex evolutionary histories of these influential island faunas. Here, we leverage whole genome resequencing (20X average coverage) and extensive sampling of all taxonomic diversity within , kingfishers, a rapid radiation of largely island endemic ‘Great Speciators.’ We find that whole genome datasets do not outright resolve the evolutionary relationships of this clade: four types of molecular markers (UCEs, BUSCOs, SNPs, and mtDNA) and tree building methods did not find a single well-supported and concordant species-level topology. We then uncover evidence of widespread incomplete lineage sorting and both ancient and contemporary gene flow and demonstrate how these factors contribute to conflicting evolutionary histories. Our complete taxonomic sampling allowed us to further identify a novel case of mitochondrial capture between two allopatric species, suggesting a potential historical (but since lost) hybrid zone as islands were successively colonized. Taken together, these results highlight how increased genomic and taxon sampling can reveal complex evolutionary patterns in rapid island radiations."

Minimal vertex model explains how the amnioserosa avoids fluidization during Drosophila dorsal closure,"Indrajit,Daniel,Janice M.,Daniel P.,Christoph F.,Andrea J.,Indrajit,Daniel,Janice M.,Daniel P.,Christoph F.,Andrea J.,Indrajit,Daniel,Janice M.,Daniel P.,Christoph F.,Andrea J.","Dorsal closure is a process that occurs during embryogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster. During dorsal closure, the amnioserosa (AS), a one-cell thick epithelial tissue that fills the dorsal opening, shrinks as the lateral epidermis sheets converge and eventually merge. During this process, both shape index and aspect ratio of amnioserosa cells increase markedly. The standard 2-dimensional vertex model, which successfully describes tissue sheet mechanics in multiple contexts, would in this case predict that the tissue should fluidize via cell neighbor changes. Surprisingly, however, the amnioserosa remains an elastic solid with no such events. We here present a minimal extension to the vertex model that explains how the amnioserosa can achieve this unexpected behavior. We show that continuous shrinkage of the preferred cell perimeter and cell perimeter polydispersity lead to the retention of the solid state of the amnioserosa. Our model accurately captures measured cell shape and orientation changes and predicts non-monotonic junction tension that we confirm with laser ablation experiments."

Opening and closing of a cryptic pocket in VP35 toggles it between two different RNA-binding modes,"Upasana L,Matthew Alberto,Neha,Maxwell I,Gregory R,Upasana L,Matthew Alberto,Neha,Maxwell I,Gregory R,Upasana L,Matthew Alberto,Neha,Maxwell I,Gregory R","Cryptic pockets are of growing interest as potential drug targets, particularly to control protein-nucleic acid interactions that often occur via flat surfaces. However, it remains unclear whether cryptic pockets contribute to protein function or if they are merely happenstantial features that can easily be evolved away to achieve drug resistance. Here, we explore whether a cryptic pocket in the Interferon Inhibitory Domain (IID) of viral protein 35 (VP35) of Zaire ebolavirus aids its ability to bind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). We use simulations and experiments to study the relationship between cryptic pocket opening and dsRNA binding of the IIDs of two other filoviruses, Reston and Marburg. These homologs have nearly identical structures but block different interferon pathways due to different affinities for blunt ends and backbone of the dsRNA. Simulations and thiol-labeling experiments demonstrate that the homologs have varying probabilities of pocket opening. Subsequent dsRNA-binding assays suggest that closed conformations preferentially bind dsRNA blunt ends while open conformations prefer binding the backbone. Point mutations that modulate pocket opening proteins further confirm this preference. These results demonstrate the open cryptic pocket has a function, suggesting cryptic pockets are under selective pressure and may be difficult to evolve away to achieve drug resistance."
Generating Multi-state Conformations of P-type ATPases with a Diffusion Model,"Jingtian,Yong,Jingtian,Yong,Jingtian,Yong","Understanding and predicting the diverse conformational states of membrane proteins is essential for elucidating their biological functions.

In this study, we introduce a method for predicting diverse functional states of membrane protein conformations using a diffusion model. Our approach integrates forward and backward diffusion processes, incorporating state classifiers and additional conditioners to control the generation gradient of conformational states. We specifically target the P-type ATPases, a key membrane transporter, for which we curated and expanded a structural dataset. By employing a graph neural network with a custom membrane constraint, our model generates precise structures for P-type ATPases across different functional states. This approach represents a significant step forward in computational structural biology and holds great potential for studying the dynamics of other membrane proteins."

However, the molecular mechanism leading to this stabilization is not well understood as there is currently no structure of the parallel dimer. To investigate the mutation's mechanism of action, we conducted extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of multiple oligomeric forms of both STAT5B and STAT5B(N642H), including a model for the parallel dimer. The N642H mutation directly affects the hydrogen bonding network within the phosphotyrosine (pY)-binding pocket of the parallel dimer, enhancing the pY-binding interaction. The simulations indicate that apo STAT5B is highly flexible, exploring a diverse conformational space. In contrast, apo STAT5B(N642H) accesses two distinct conformational states, one of which resembles the conformation of the parallel dimer.  The simulation predictions of the effects of the mutation on structure and dynamics are supported by the results of hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry measurements carried out on STAT5B and STAT5B(N642H) in which a phosphopeptide was used to mimic the effects of parallel dimerization on the SH2 domain. The molecular-level information uncovered in this work contributes to our understanding of STAT5B hyperactivation by the N642H mutation and could help pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting this mutation."
"Weak magnetic field effects in biology are measurable—accelerated , embryogenesis in the absence of the geomagnetic field","Alessandro,Geoff,Lykourgos,Tobias,Dmitry,Peter,Clarice D.,Alessandro,Geoff,Lykourgos,Tobias,Dmitry,Peter,Clarice D.,Alessandro,Geoff,Lykourgos,Tobias,Dmitry,Peter,Clarice D.","Despite decades of reports of weak magnetic field effects in biology across the tree of life and on a broad range of cell types, the evidence to date remains met with skepticism. To remedy this, we present open-data, large scale, and varied morphological evidence that , embryo development is accelerated in a well engineered, environmentally-calibrated hypomagnetic field of less than 1 nT. These data imply that basal tadpole physiology can sense and react to the absence of Earth's minute magnetic field of approximately 50 µT. The effect is significant, as demonstrated by a variety of statistical measures. As no definitive biophysical mechanism has been identified to account for its occurrence, this study raises the question of which mechanism provides the most plausible explanation. How that question is answered may have implications in a variety of fields, including human health, behavioral ecology, and space exploration."
Epidermal microstructures on the paired fins of marine sculpins provide new insights into mechanisms supporting benthic station-holding,"Emily A.,Austin M.,Shubham,L. Ann,Tom,Emily A.,Austin M.,Shubham,L. Ann,Tom,Emily A.,Austin M.,Shubham,L. Ann,Tom","Harsh environments, such as those with breaking waves and turbulent flows, present extreme challenges to organismal survival. Many animals exploiting these habitats possess adaptations to maintain position under dynamic flow conditions, such as reversible or permanent attachment systems. However, some station-holding fishes (e.g., sculpins) instead rely on morphological and behavioral modifications of their pectoral fins to increase friction with the substrate and combat drag. Despite epidermal microstructures on the fins of other benthic fishes, little exploration of pectoral fin surfaces at the microscopic scale has been undertaken in sculpins. Using scanning electron microscopy, we discovered microscopic, fibrillar projections contained within single cells on the ventral surfaces of the paired fin rays of two intertidal and two subtidal species of marine sculpins. In contrast to subtidal species, the intertidal species possessed epidermal cells with discrete channels separating groups of fibrillar projections. These features bear a striking resemblance to epidermal microstructures described in other fishes but have distinct morphological differences. We posit that these previously overlooked features likely contribute to sculpin station-holding performance via enhanced mechanical interactions with the substrate, suggesting new taxa within which to examine mechanisms of underwater friction enhancement and adhesion."
"The conformational equilibria of a human GPCR compared between lipid vesicles and aqueous solutions by integrative ,-NMR","Arka,Beining,Matthew,Arka,Beining,Matthew,Arka,Beining,Matthew","Endogenous phospholipids influence the conformational equilibria of G protein-coupled receptors, regulating their ability to bind drugs and form signaling complexes.  However, most studies of GPCR-lipid interactions have been carried out in mixed micelles or lipid nanodiscs.  Though useful, these membrane mimetics do not fully replicate the physical properties of native cellular membranes associated with large assemblies of lipids.  We investigated the conformational equilibria of the human A, adenosine receptor (A,AR) in phospholipid vesicles using ,F solid-state magic angle spinning NMR (SSNMR).  By applying an optimized sample preparation workflow and experimental conditions, we were able to obtain ,F-SSNMR spectra for both antagonist- and agonist-bound complexes with sensitivity and line widths closely comparable to those achieved using solution NMR.  This facilitated a direct comparison of the A2AAR conformational equilibria across detergent micelle, lipid nanodisc, and lipid vesicle preparations.  While antagonist-bound A,AR showed a similar conformational equilibria across all membrane and membrane mimetic systems, the conformational equilibria of agonist-bound A,AR exhibited differences among different environments.  This suggests that the conformational equilibria of GPCRs may be influenced not only by specific receptor-lipid interactions but also by the membrane properties found in larger lipid assemblies."
Bringing Attomolar Detection to the Point-of-Care with Nanopatterned DNA Origami Nanoantennas,"Renukka,Kateryna,Mihir,Vivien,Benedikt,Jan,Cindy,Michael,Giovanni,Leoni,Sophia,Viktorija,Tim,Philip,Renukka,Kateryna,Mihir,Vivien,Benedikt,Jan,Cindy,Michael,Giovanni,Leoni,Sophia,Viktorija,Tim,Philip,Renukka,Kateryna,Mihir,Vivien,Benedikt,Jan,Cindy,Michael,Giovanni,Leoni,Sophia,Viktorija,Tim,Philip","Creating increasingly sensitive and cost-effective nucleic acid detection methods is critical for enhancing point-of-care (POC) applications. This involves capturing all desired biomarkers in a sample with high specificity and transducing the capture events to a detector. However, the signal from biomarkers present at extremely low amounts often falls below the detection limit of typical fluorescence-based methods, making molecular amplification a necessary step. Here, we present a nucleic acid detection assay of a 151-nucleotide sequence specific to antibiotics-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, based on single-molecule fluorescence detection of non-amplified DNA down to the attomolar level, using Trident NanoAntennas with Cleared HOtSpots (NACHOS). Our NACHOS-diagnostics assay leverages a compact microscope with a large field-of-view and cost-efficient components, including microfluidic flow to enhance capturing efficiency. Fluorescence enhancement is provided by DNA origami NanoAntennas, arranged in a dense array using a combination of nanosphere lithography and site-specific DNA origami placement. Our method can detect 200 ± 50 out of 600 molecules in a 100 μL sample volume within an hour. This represents typical number of pathogens in clinical samples commonly detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction but without the need for molecular amplification. We achieve similar sensitivity in untreated human blood plasma, enhancing the practical applicability of the system. Our platform can be adapted to detect shorter nucleic acid fragments that are not compatible with traditional amplification-based technologies. This broadens its potential for diverse diagnostic and healthcare applications, providing a robust and scalable solution for sensitive nucleic acid detection in various clinical settings."
Reliable reconstruction of cricket song from biophysical models and preserved specimens,"Ryan J,Sarah C,Gabriella VS,Nathan W,Natasha,Ryan J,Sarah C,Gabriella VS,Nathan W,Natasha,Ryan J,Sarah C,Gabriella VS,Nathan W,Natasha","Predicting the function of a biological structure solely from its morphology can be a very powerful tool in several fields of biology, but especially in evolutionary reconstruction. In the field of invertebrate acoustic communication, reconstructing the acoustic properties of sound-producing forewings in crickets has been based on two very divergent methods, finite element modelling (FEM) and vibrometric measurements from preserved specimens. Both methods, however, make strong simplifying assumptions which have not been tested and the reliability of inferences made from either method remains in question. Here we rigorously test and refine both reconstruction methods using the well-known Teleogryllus oceanicus model system and determine the appropriate conditions required to reconstruct the vibroacoustic behaviour of male forewings. We find that when using FEM it is not necessary to assume simplified boundary conditions if the appropriate parameters are found. When using preserved specimens, we find that the sample needs to be rehydrated for reliable reconstruction, however, it may be possible to accomplish rehydration in silico using FEM. Our findings provide a refined methodology for the reliable reconstruction of cricket songs, whether from fossils or preserved specimens from museums or field collections."
Evolution of the skull in arvicoline cricetids (Rodentia) according to 3D morphometric insights: Part 1. Morphological disparity of the palato-spheno-pterygoid complex,"Leonid L.,Daniel A.,Leonid L.,Daniel A.,Leonid L.,Daniel A.","Our paper is the first contribution to the comprehensive analysis of the complicated evolution of cranial and mandibular parts connected by pterygoid muscles, as part of more global investigation into adaptive evolution of Arvicolinae. The analysis was performed on 90 micro-computed-tomography–scanned specimens from 33 species from 19 genera of Arvicolinae as well as two species from two genera of Cricetinae as an outgroup. We revised 11 morphological traits of the “palato-spheno-pterygoid” complex, including key features of the palatine that are highly important for defining Arvicolinae taxa according to the micro-computed-tomography data. We also homologized characters of the posterior palatal margin and categorized the composition of the palatal elements into two main morphotypes: morphotype “A” is unique to Clethrionomyini and morphotype “B” was subdivided into three additional types and was found to occur in the outgroup (cricetines), voles (B2), and lemmings (B3). Morphospace analysis of the palato-spheno-pterygoid complex by means of the three-dimensional dataset revealed a mode of transformation of morphotype “A” into morphotype “B2.” A separate task was the development of a protocol for the preparation of morphological data for subsequent evaluation of genotype–phenotype relationships using specialized software applications (e.g., RERconverge)."

The role of RNA in the nanoscale organization of alpha-synuclein phase separation,"Sabrina,Eleonora,Jakob,Elsa,Eli,Gian Gaetano,Giuseppe,Sabrina,Eleonora,Jakob,Elsa,Eli,Gian Gaetano,Giuseppe,Sabrina,Eleonora,Jakob,Elsa,Eli,Gian Gaetano,Giuseppe","The cellular accumulation of alpha-synuclein (aS) aggregates is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies suggest that the aberrant transition of monomeric aS into solid-like aggregates may occur through an intermediate liquid-like state, where the protein partitions between dense and dilute phases. Although aS is not typically recognized as an RNA-binding protein, it can bind RNA under aggregation conditions, but its impact on aS liquid-like phases remains unexplored. Employing a combination of fluorescence spectroscopy techniques, we investigated aS dynamics in both phases in the presence of RNA. Our analysis revealed the formation of nanoclusters involved in initiating phase separation and uncovered heterogeneity within the dense phase, discovering that aS molecules exist in two distinct mobility states. Additionally, we demonstrated that RNA induces morphological changes and promotes the liquid-to-solid transition of aS dense phase. These findings underscore the active role of RNA in modulating aS phase transitions."

To supplement the existing literature, data from the International Whaling Commission catch database were reviewed and incorporated into analyses to improve descriptions of intraspecific variation in adult size for ,. Regional comparisons of commercial data for , revealed apparent differences in adult size that are likely more attributable to catch biases rather than a diagnostic difference in size between populations."
Mutant p53 regulates cancer cell invasion in complex three-dimensional environments through mevalonate pathway-dependent Rho/ROCK signaling.,"Asja,Tatsuya,Alexander J,Gizem,Raul,Karen,Kausik,Iris G,Rachel C,Rafaela,Anil K,Laura J,Carol,Asja,Tatsuya,Alexander J,Gizem,Raul,Karen,Kausik,Iris G,Rachel C,Rafaela,Anil K,Laura J,Carol,Asja,Tatsuya,Alexander J,Gizem,Raul,Karen,Kausik,Iris G,Rachel C,Rafaela,Anil K,Laura J,Carol","Certain mutations can confer neomorphic gain of function (GOF) activities to the p53 protein that affect cancer progression. Yet the concept of mutant p53 GOF has been challenged.  Here, using various strategies to alter the status of mutant versions of p53 in different cell lines, we demonstrate that mutant p53 stimulates cancer cell invasion in three-dimensional environments. Mechanistically, mutant p53 enhances RhoA/ROCK-dependent cell contractility and cell-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) re-organization via increasing mevalonate pathway-dependent RhoA localization to the membrane. In line with this, RhoA-dependent pro-invasive activity is also mediated by IDI-1, a mevalonate pathway product.  Further, the invasion-enhancing effect of mutant p53 is dictated by the biomechanical properties of the surrounding ECM, thereby adding a cell-independent layer of regulation to mutant p53 GOF activity that is mediated by dynamic reciprocal cell-ECM interactions. Together our findings link mutant p53 metabolic GOF activity with an invasive cellular phenotype in physiologically relevant and context-dependent settings."

In vitro models to mimic tumor endothelial cell-mediated immune cell reprogramming in lung adenocarcinoma,"Morgane,Judith,Emilie,Virginie,Marine,Valentin,Hortense,Camille,Vincent,David,Nicolas,Richard,Isabelle,Christophe,Lucas,Morgane,Judith,Emilie,Virginie,Marine,Valentin,Hortense,Camille,Vincent,David,Nicolas,Richard,Isabelle,Christophe,Lucas,Morgane,Judith,Emilie,Virginie,Marine,Valentin,Hortense,Camille,Vincent,David,Nicolas,Richard,Isabelle,Christophe,Lucas","Tumor endothelial (TECs) cells play a critical role in regulating immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the mechanisms by which TECs modulate immune cell population remain unclear, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we investigated how NSCLC cells tweak normal endothelial cells (NECs) into TECs and the subsequent effects on immune regulation. NECs were cocultured with various NSCLC cell lines, using 2D and 3D coculture models to evaluate TEC-mediated effects on immune cells. We show that direct coculture led to significant transcriptomic, proteomic and kinomic alterations in TECs, especially in pro-inflammatory pathways. We identified a downregulation of the co-stimulatory molecule OX40L in TECs compared to NECs, suggesting impaired T-cell proliferation support. While TECs showed a limited effect on CD8+ T-cell activation, TECs supported CD4 T-cells polarization into Treg and Th22 subsets. Moreover, TECs also promoted M2-like macrophages polarization, thereby potentially contributing to the TME immunosuppression. State-of-the-art single-cell RNA sequencing of 3D multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) revealed distinct TEC subpopulations, including an inflammatory subset with UPR signature. The latter was absent in 2D-cultured NECs but present in freshly isolated and 2D-cultured TECs from NSCLC patients. Importantly, we also identified within MCTS a perivascular M2-like macrophage subset, predicted to interact with TECs with MIF and Midkine signaling. In conclusion, TECs in NSCLC tumors play a pivotal role in remodeling the TME immune landscape by promoting immune suppression. This study highlights the complex immunoregulatory functions of TECs within our different in vitro models that mimic aspects of the TME. Our data may provide new insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting TECs or regulatory signaling to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in NSCLC."

TGF-β induces an atypical EMT to evade immune mechanosurveillance in lung adenocarcinoma dormant metastasis,"Zhenghan,Yassmin,Ines,Lila,George,Yanyan,Joao,Morgan,Joan,Zhenghan,Yassmin,Ines,Lila,George,Yanyan,Joao,Morgan,Joan,Zhenghan,Yassmin,Ines,Lila,George,Yanyan,Joao,Morgan,Joan","The heterogeneity of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programs is manifest in the diverse EMT-like phenotypes occurring during tumor progression. However, little is known about the mechanistic basis and functional role of specific forms of EMT in cancer. Here we address this question in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells that enter a dormancy period in response to TGF-β upon disseminating to distant sites. LUAD cells with the capacity to enter dormancy are characterized by expression of SOX2 and NKX2-1 primitive progenitor markers. In these cells, TGF-β induces growth inhibition accompanied by a full EMT response that subsequently transitions into an atypical mesenchymal state of round morphology and lacking actin stress fibers. TGF-β induces this transition by driving the expression of the actin-depolymerizing factor gelsolin, which changes a migratory, stress fiber-rich mesenchymal phenotype into a cortical actin-rich, spheroidal state. This transition lowers the biomechanical stiffness of metastatic progenitors, protecting them from killing by mechanosensitive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. Inhibiting this actin depolymerization process clears tissues of dormant metastatic cells. Thus, LUAD primitive progenitors undergo an atypical EMT as part of a strategy to evade immune-mediated elimination during dormancy. Our results provide a mechanistic basis and functional role of this atypical EMT response of LUAD metastatic progenitors and further illuminate the role of TGF-β as a crucial driver of immune evasive metastatic dormancy."
"Effects of fasting on heat-stressed broiler chickens: part I- growth performance, meat quality, gut histomorphological and microbial responses","Tanvir,Md.

Abul,Afifa,Ankon,Shahina,Takashi,Shubash Chandra","The current study aimed to optimize the fasting duration in order to mitigate the detrimental effects of heat stress on broilers raised in hot and humid climatic environments. A total of 500 broiler DOCs were assigned to five distinct treatment groups: Tₒ= Non-fasted controlled temperature (24-26℃) (NF-CT), T,= Non-fasted heat stressed (30-38℃) (NF-HS), T,= 6 hours fasted heat stressed (6-h FHS), T,= 8 hours fasted heat stressed (8-h FHS), and T,= 10 hours fasted heat stressed (10-h FHS). Each treatment was replicated five times, with 20 birds in each replicate group. As expected, the birds in NF-CT group showed significantly better performances for all the growth parameters, although birds who fasted for 8-h under heat stress exerted better growth and FCR in comparison to the other HS groups. Fasting of birds under heat stress significantly showed the lowest mortality. Like the NF-CT group, birds in 8-h FHS achieved significantly higher dressing percentage, breast meat, liver yields, and the lowest abdominal fat. Fasting for 8- and 10-h significantly increased breast meat pH and water holding capacity and thus reduced cooking loss. Fasting also improved the breast meat color quality by increasing redness (a*) and reducing the hue angle values comparable with the NF-CT group. A significantly upward trend in villi height (VH), width (VW) and crypt depth (CD) of gut segments was also observed in the birds of the 8-h FHS group. Total bacterial and coliform counts in cecum contents were reduced significantly with the increase in the fasting period. Benefit-cost analysis showed better profitability in the 8-h FHS group than other HS groups. Taken altogether, it can be concluded that broiler chicken exposed to 8-h fasting period is an effective approach to mitigate heat stress under hot and humid climatic conditions."

Surprisingly, despite inducing rapid and highly penetrant obesity and long-term differences in metabolic and adiposity, greater than one year of HFD had no significant effect on survival or tumor burden. These findings were replicated in two separate cohorts and thus provide important negative data for the field. Given strong publication bias against negative data in the literature, this large cohort study represents a clear case where chronic diet-induced obesity does not accelerate or aggravate cancer outcomes. The data thus carry high impact for researchers, funders, and policymakers alike."
Genomic Discovery of EF-24 Targets Unveils Antitumorigenic Mechanisms in Leukemia Cells,"Ajeet P,Noah,James,Ana,Jonathan,Ajeet P,Noah,James,Ana,Jonathan,Ajeet P,Noah,James,Ana,Jonathan","Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound derived from the plant , L., has demonstrated a wide range of therapeutic properties, including potential anticancer effects. However, its clinical efficacy is limited due to poor bioavailability and stability. To overcome these challenges, curcumin analogs like EF-24 have been developed with improved pharmacological properties. In this study, we used whole-transcriptome profiling to identify the genome-wide functional impacts of EF-24 treatment in leukemia cells to improve our understanding of its potential mechanisms of action. This approach allowed us to establish a model system for associating druggable genes with clinical disease targets. We used the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line K-562 and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines HL-60, Kasumi-1, and THP-1 to conduct EF-24 treatment studies. Cell viability was significantly decreased in the EF-24treated cells as compared to the untreated controls. We discovered that the genes ATF3, CLU, HSPA6, OSGIN1, ZFAND2A, and CXCL8, which are associated with reduced cell viability and proliferation, were consistently upregulated in all EF-24treated cell lines. Further analysis of the tested cell lines revealed the activation of various signaling pathways, including the STAT1 regulated S100 family signaling pathway, that controlled downstream gene expression in response to EF-24 treatment. Our results elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying EF-24's antitumor efficacy against leukemia, highlighting its multifaceted impact on signaling pathways and gene networks that regulate cell survival, proliferation, and immune responses in myeloid leukemia cells."
Targeting the 3D genome by anthracyclines for chemotherapeutic effects,"Minkang,Shengnan,Yuchen,Andrea A.,Douglas H.,Liping,Baoxu,Minkang,Shengnan,Yuchen,Andrea A.,Douglas H.,Liping,Baoxu,Minkang,Shengnan,Yuchen,Andrea A.,Douglas H.,Liping,Baoxu","The chromatins are folded into three-dimensional (3D) structures inside cells, which coordinates the regulation of gene transcription by the non-coding regulatory elements. Aberrant chromatin 3D folding has been shown in many diseases, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and may contribute to tumorigenesis. The anthracycline topoisomerase II inhibitors can induce histone eviction and DNA damage. We performed genome-wide high-resolution mapping of the chemotherapeutic effects of various clinically used anthracycline drugs. ATAC-seq was used to profile the histone eviction effects of different anthracyclines. TOP2A ChIP-seq was used to profile the potential DNA damage regions. Integrated analyses show that different anthracyclines have distinct target selectivity on epigenomic regions, based on their respective ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq profiles. We identified the underlying molecular mechanism that unique anthracycline variants selectively target chromatin looping anchors via disrupting CTCF binding, suggesting an additional potential therapeutic effect on the 3D genome. We further performed Hi-C experiments, and data from K562 cells treated with the selective anthracycline drugs indicate that the 3D chromatin organization is disrupted. Furthermore, AML patients receiving anthracycline drugs showed altered chromatin structures around potential looping anchors, which linked to distinct clinical outcomes. Our data indicate that anthracyclines are potent and selective epigenomic targeting drugs and can target the 3D genome for anticancer therapy, which could be used for personalized medicine to treat tumors with aberrant 3D chromatin structures."
Bridging the Gap in Immunotherapy Prediction: The AGAE Score as a Pan Cancer Biomarker for Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Response,"Bicheng,Jun,Qingren,Xiaoqing,Aimin,Pengpeng,Bicheng,Jun,Qingren,Xiaoqing,Aimin,Pengpeng,Bicheng,Jun,Qingren,Xiaoqing,Aimin,Pengpeng","Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy efficacy varies among cancer patients, necessitating precise predictive biomarkers for optimized treatment strategies.
Methods: We developed the Adaptive best subset selection algorithm and Genetic algorithm Aided Ensemble learning (AGAE) score through multi-cohort transcriptomic analysis of ICI-treated patients. The AGAE score incorporated gene-pairing, Adaptive Best Subset Selection for feature optimization, and a Genetic Algorithm for optimal basic learner identification. We explored correlations between AGAE score and immune microenvironments using multi-omics data. Potential targets were screened using 17 CRISPR datasets and validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments.
Results: The AGAE score demonstrated robust predictive power for ICI therapy outcomes, with lower scores correlating with enhanced treatment response. The AGAE score outperformed published signatures and conventional biomarkers. Lower AGAE scores were associated with increased immune cell infiltration, higher immunogenicity, and enhanced antitumor immune activity. The CEP55 was identified as a potential key target driving immune evasion through AGAE scoring and CRISPR screening. Experimental validation showed CEP55 downregulation attenuated tumor cell malignancy and augmented ICI therapy efficacy by modulating T cell responses.
Conclusions: The AGAE score was a potent predictor of ICI therapy efficacy, facilitating refined patient stratification. CEP55's role in the tumor microenvironment's immune response highlights its potential as a therapeutic target. Targeted interventions against CEP55 may improve immunotherapy precision."
Nrf2 orchestrates epigenetic regulations and serves as the master regulator of KLF4 expression and activity during arsenic-induced transformation,"Ziwei,Zhuoyue,Jessica,Yiran,Wenxuan,Haoyan,John,Chitra,Fei,Ziwei,Zhuoyue,Jessica,Yiran,Wenxuan,Haoyan,John,Chitra,Fei,Ziwei,Zhuoyue,Jessica,Yiran,Wenxuan,Haoyan,John,Chitra,Fei","Emerging evidence suggests that Nrf2 plays a pro-carcinogenic role in cancer. Our previous study showed that arsenic-induced Nrf2 activation triggers metabolic reprogramming, leading to the formation of cancer stem-like cells. Here, we further demonstrated that KLF4, a key pluripotency factor, is a direct transcriptional target of Nrf2 in arsenic-exposed human bronchial epithelial cells. ChIP-seq analysis identified multiple Nrf2 binding peaks at the Klf4 gene locus, which overlap with the enhancer markers H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac. Nrf2 knockout reduced both KLF4 expression and enhancer marker enrichment, accompanied by a global decrease in KLF4 binding across the genome. In wild-type (WT) cells, arsenic treatment increased KLF4 binding on genes involved in oncogenic pathways such as STAT3, SOX2, Nrf2, cell growth, Hedgehog, and EMT. We also found that KLF4 engages in a self-feedback loop in response to Nrf2 signaling. Lastly, our data showed that the co-occupancy of Nrf2 and KLF4 is crucial for establishing active enhancer hubs in the genome. These findings suggest that the oncogenic effects of Nrf2 are, in part, mediated by Nrf2 dependent self-amplification of KLF4 expression and function. Thus, targeting both Nrf2 and KLF4 could be a promising therapeutic strategy for eliminating cancer stem-like cells."
Fine decomposition of rodent behavior via unsupervised segmentation and clustering of inertial signals,"Romain,Marie,Clément,Daniela,Pierre,Guillaume P.,Romain,Marie,Clément,Daniela,Pierre,Guillaume P.,Romain,Marie,Clément,Daniela,Pierre,Guillaume P.","Decomposing behavior into elementary components remains a central challenge in computational neuroethology.

We present an alternative approach using inertial sensors, which capture high-resolution, environment-independent, and compact three-dimensional kinematic data, and are commonly integrated into rodent neurophysiological devices. Our analysis pipeline leverages unsupervised, computationally efficient change-point detection to break down inertial time series into variable-length, statistically homogeneous segments. These segments are then grouped into candidate behavioral motifs through high-dimensional, model-based probabilistic clustering. We demonstrate that this approach achieves detailed rodent behavioral mapping using head inertial data. Identified motifs, corroborated by video recordings, include orienting movements, grooming components, locomotion, and olfactory exploration. Higher-order behavioral structures can be accessed by applying a categorical hidden Markov model to the motif sequence. Additionally, our pipeline detects both overt and subtle motor changes in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease and levodopa-induced dyskinesia, highlighting its value for behavioral phenotyping. This methodology offers the possibility of conducting high-resolution, observer-unbiased behavioral analysis at minimal computational cost from easily scalable and environmentally unconstrained recordings."

Replicating retroviral delivery of an IL-15 superagonist improves antitumor immunity and long-term survival in poorly immunogenic glioblastoma models,"Alexander Fadi,Atul,Jordan,Sara,Isabella,Sabraj,Megan L.,Poojan,Jingpyo,Elaina,Pavlina,Meeki,Eric,Noriyuki,Manish K.,Alexander Fadi,Atul,Jordan,Sara,Isabella,Sabraj,Megan L.,Poojan,Jingpyo,Elaina,Pavlina,Meeki,Eric,Noriyuki,Manish K.,Alexander Fadi,Atul,Jordan,Sara,Isabella,Sabraj,Megan L.,Poojan,Jingpyo,Elaina,Pavlina,Meeki,Eric,Noriyuki,Manish K.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain neoplasm due to its highly immunosuppressive microenvironment and resistance to conventional therapies. To overcome this challenge, we engineered a replicating retrovirus (RRV) to deliver a superagonist interleukin-15 receptor-linker fusion protein (RLI) directly to tumor cells, engineering them into local immunotherapy biofactories. This strategy leverages the tumor-selective replication of RRV to achieve localized and sustained RLI expression within the tumor microenvironment. In two orthotopic poorly immunogenic GBM mouse models, intratumoral administration of RRV RLI significantly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival compared to controls, with some mice achieving long-term remission and demonstrating immunological memory upon rechallenge. Transcriptomic and flow cytometric analyses revealed that RRV RLI treatment enhanced infiltration and activation of CD8⁺ T cells and NK cells, and upregulated antigen presentation pathways within the tumor microenvironment. Depletion studies indicated that the therapeutic efficacy of RRV RLI is dependent on both CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells. Notably, combining RRV RLI with the GBM standard of care chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide synergistically improved survival outcomes. Subsequent single-cell RNA and T-cell receptor sequencing identified enhanced effector cell activation, antigen presentation, and clonal T-cell expansion in the combination therapy group. Our findings suggest that RRV-mediated delivery of RLI effectively transforms GBM tumors into immunostimulatory hubs, eliciting potent anti-tumor immune responses. This novel viral immunotherapy holds significant promise for clinical translation in the treatment of GBM and other difficult-to-treat solid tumors."

The role of DDX41 in hematopoiesis and how its germline and somatic mutations contribute to MNs remain unclear. Here we show that DDX41 is essential for erythropoiesis but dispensable for the development of other hematopoietic lineages. Using stage-specific Cre models for erythropoiesis, we reveal that Ddx41 knockout in early erythropoiesis is embryonically lethal, while knockout in late-stage terminal erythropoiesis allows mice to survive with normal blood counts. DDX41 deficiency induces a significant upregulation of G-quadruplexes (G4), noncanonical DNA structures that tend to accumulate in the early stages of erythroid precursors. We show that DDX41 co-localizes with G4 on the erythroid genome. DDX41 directly binds to and dissolves G4, which is significantly compromised in MN-associated DDX41 mutants. Accumulation of G4 by DDX41 deficiency induces erythroid genome instability, defects in ribosomal biogenesis, and upregulation of p53. However, p53 deficiency does not rescue the embryonic death of Ddx41 hematopoietic-specific knockout mice. In parallel, genome instability also activates the cGas-Sting pathway, which is detrimental to survival since cGas-deficient and hematopoietic-specific Ddx41 knockout mice are viable without detectable hematologic phenotypes, although these mice continue to show erythroid ribosomal defects and upregulation of p53. These findings are further supported by data from a DDX41 mutated MN patient and human iPSC-derived bone marrow organoids. Our study establishes DDX41 as a G4 dissolver, essential for erythroid genome stability and suppressing the cGAS-STING pathway."
"Effect of different lining paper materials and infusions on oviposition preference of , (Diptera: Culicidae) gravid mosquitoes","Mahfuza,Kajla,Md. Aftab,Ananna,Md. Forhad,Mahfuza,Kajla,Md. Aftab,Ananna,Md. Forhad,Mahfuza,Kajla,Md. Aftab,Ananna,Md.

Understanding the breeding behavior of , is crucial to control this vector and thereby limiting the spread of diseases. To study this mosquito breeding in the laboratories and ovitraps, different types of lining-papers, surrounding inner surface of a container along with different types of added infusions, are used. Lining-papers serve as surfaces for oviposition and infusions provide the essential environment for nurturing. The types of oviposition surfaces and infusions used in laboratory rearing facilities or ovitraps influence oviposition preference, changing the breeding behavior of , gravid mosquitoes. This study presents a comparative study on oviposition preferences for six different types of lining-papers and six different types of infusions in a bioassay cage. ANOVA analysis shows a significant effect on oviposition preference of different types of lining-papers that served as oviposition surfaces. The highest oviposition activity was observed for the , lining-paper when normal tap water infusion was used. Likewise, statistical analysis shows that when a , lining-paper was used, a highly statistically significant effect on oviposition preference is observed for different types of infusions used in the oviposition cups."
Optical imaging of treatment-naive human NSCLC reveals changes associated with metastatic recurrence,"Paola Monterroso,Jesse D,Stephanie D,Charles M,Konstantinos,Kyle P,Narasimhan,Paola Monterroso,Jesse D,Stephanie D,Charles M,Konstantinos,Kyle P,Narasimhan,Paola Monterroso,Jesse D,Stephanie D,Charles M,Konstantinos,Kyle P,Narasimhan","Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths, comprising nearly 25% of all cancer deaths [1]. The five-year survival rate of patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) remains significantly low given that over half present with locally advanced or metastatic disease at time of diagnosis, and experience tumor recurrence following therapeutic intervention [2,3]. Current evaluation techniques to assess treatment response are lacking, given they are implemented several weeks after treatment completion and are solely based on anatomical changes in tumor size, forgoing other criteria such as functional or metabolic changes. There is a critical need to identify surrogate markers early on following diagnosis, that aid in distinguishing patients based on their long-term outcome. Two photon microscopy (TPM) techniques provide non-invasive high-resolution information on cell metabolism within tissue by utilizing an optical redox ratio (ORR) of FAD/[NADH+FAD] autofluorescence. The goal of this study is to use the ORR and NADH fluorescence lifetime decay to identify measurable differences in optical endpoints of human NSCLC that are indicative of their long-term outcome. Twenty-nine treatment-naive NSCLC specimens were classified into metastatic and non-metastatic groups according to subject-detail reports. The ORR and mean NADH lifetime were determined for each sample, revealing a significant increase in the ORR for the metastatic group. Given that KEAP1 expression has previously been associated with poor patient outcomes, we stained our samples for KEAP1 and found low KEAP1 expression regions to be associated with higher ORR. A deep learning network base on Inception-ResNet-v2 trained on imaging endpoints (AUC = 0.68) outperformed a model built with only clinicopathologic features (AUC = 0.45), when classifying tumors based on their metastatic status. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using optical imaging of autofluorescence of metabolic cofactors to identify differences indicative of long-term patient outcome."
Global chromatin reorganization and regulation of genes with specific evolutionary ages during differentiation and cancer,"Flavien,Kaustav,Dariusz,Benoît,Vera,Flavien,Kaustav,Dariusz,Benoît,Vera,Flavien,Kaustav,Dariusz,Benoît,Vera","Cancer cells are highly plastic, allowing them to adapt to changing conditions. Genes related to basic cellular processes evolved in ancient species, while more specialized genes appeared later with multicellularity (metazoan genes) or even after mammals evolved. Transcriptomic analyses have shown that ancient genes are up-regulated in cancer, while metazoan-origin genes are inactivated. Despite the importance of these observations, the underlying mechanisms remain unexplored. Here, we study local and global epigenomic mechanisms that may regulate genes from specific evolutionary periods. Using evolutionary gene age data, we characterize the epigenomic landscape, gene expression regulation, and chromatin organization in three cell types: human embryonic stem cells, normal B-cells, and primary cells from Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, a B-cell malignancy. We identify topological changes in chromatin organization during differentiation observing patterns in Polycomb repression and RNA Polymerase II pausing, which are reversed during oncogenesis. Beyond the non-random organization of genes and chromatin features in the 3D epigenome, we suggest that these patterns lead to preferential interactions among ancient, intermediate, and recent genes, mediated by RNA Polymerase II, Polycomb, and the lamina, respectively. Our findings shed light on gene regulation according to evolutionary age and suggest this organization changes across differentiation and oncogenesis."

Viral mimicry has been previously described to augment anti-tumor immune responses and sensitize solid tumors to immunotherapy including colorectal cancer, melanoma, and clear renal cell carcinoma. Here, we found that targeting a novel, master epigenetic regulator, Zinc Finger Protein 638 (ZNF638), induces viral mimicry in glioblastoma (GBM) preclinical models and potentiates immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). ZNF638 recruits the HUSH complex, which precipitates repressive H3K9me3 marks on endogenous REs. In GBM, ZNF638 is associated with marked locoregional immunosuppressive transcriptional signatures, reduced endogenous RE expression and poor immune cell infiltration (CD8+ T-cells, dendritic cells). ZNF638 knockdown decreased H3K9-trimethylation, increased cytosolic dsRNA and activated intracellular dsRNA-signaling cascades (RIG-I, MDA5 and IRF3). Furthermore, ZNF638 knockdown upregulated antiviral immune programs and significantly increased PD-L1 immune checkpoint expression in patient-derived GBM neurospheres and diverse murine models. Importantly, targeting ZNF638 sensitized mice to ICI in syngeneic murine orthotopic models through innate interferon signaling. This response was recapitulated in recurrent GBM (rGBM) samples with radiographic responses to checkpoint inhibition with widely increased expression of dsRNA, PD-L1 and perivascular CD8 cell infiltration, suggesting dsRNA-signaling may mediate response to immunotherapy. Finally, we showed that low ZNF638 expression was a biomarker of clinical response to ICI and improved survival in rGBM patients and melanoma patients. Our findings suggest that ZNF638 could serve as a target to potentiate immunotherapy in gliomas."

Although highly efficient, radiation cause severe damages to normal tissue and radio-induced toxicities vary from mild pneumonitis to pulmonary fibrosis. The mechanism leading to these toxicities remain unclear. To investigate the molecular responses of human lung to radiotherapy, we analyzed, by single cell RNAseq, lung tissue resected in the vicinity of the tumor (i.e. treated with radiation) and compared the transcriptional profiles of the distinct lung populations from the same patient removed at distance from the tumor (i.e. non-treated with radiation). Analysis of six lung samples from patients suffering from Pancoast tumor, a rare lung malignancy that requires neo-adjuvant radiotherapy before surgery, revealed a strong induction of VEGF signaling after radiotherapy. Expression of VEGFA, one of the canonical pro-angiogenic ligands, was found upregulated in multiple cell populations in lung exposed to high doses of radiation. Irradiated capillaries, particularly gCap cells, expressing KDR/VEGFR2, present transcriptional profile similar to tip cells, characterized by sprouting and motility capacities. In addition, we identified a sub-population of alveolar macrophages expressing FLT1/VEGFR1, a receptor for VEGFA, in lung tissues treated by radiotherapy. Cell-Cell communication analysis revealed that FLT1/VEGFR1 positive macrophages interact with tip cells after radiotherapy through IL1B-IL1R signaling. Lastly, analysis of mouse single cell dataset confirmed the increase in the proportion of gCap cells presenting a tip-like phenotype after radiation injury. Altogether, this study describes, at the single cell level, the pro-angiogenic responses of human lung after radiotherapy. These results will lead to a better understanding of the physiopathology of lung radiation injury and may pave the way to optimize treatments to improve patients quality of life."
Molecular and cell phenotype programs in oral epithelial cells directed by co-exposure to arsenic and smokeless tobacco,"Samrat,Shefali,Vincent,Francois,Liesel,Claire,Cyrille,Marie-Pierre,Stephane,Assunta,Cecila,Akram,Zdenko,Michael,Jiri,Samrat,Shefali,Vincent,Francois,Liesel,Claire,Cyrille,Marie-Pierre,Stephane,Assunta,Cecila,Akram,Zdenko,Michael,Jiri,Samrat,Shefali,Vincent,Francois,Liesel,Claire,Cyrille,Marie-Pierre,Stephane,Assunta,Cecila,Akram,Zdenko,Michael,Jiri","Chronic arsenic exposure can lead to various health issues, including cancer. Concerns have been mounting about the enhancement of arsenic toxicity through co-exposure to various prevalent lifestyle habits. Smokeless tobacco products are commonly consumed in South Asian countries, where their use frequently co-occurs with exposure to arsenic from contaminated groundwater. To decipher the in vitro molecular and cellular responses to arsenic and/or smokeless tobacco, we performed temporal multi-omics analysis of the transcriptome and DNA methylome remodelling in exposed hTERT-immortalized human normal oral keratinocytes (NOK), as well as arsenic and/or smokeless tobacco genotoxicity and mutagenicity investigations in NOK cells and in human p53 knock-in murine embryonic fibroblasts (Hupki MEF). RNAseq results from acute exposures to arsenic alone and in combination with smokeless tobacco extract revealed upregulation of genes with roles in cell cycle changes, apoptosis and inflammation responses. This was in keeping with global DNA hypomethylation affecting genes involved in the same processes in response to chronic treatment in NOK cells. At the phenotypic level, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in NOK cell viability, induction of DNA damage, cell cycle changes and increased apoptosis, with the most pronounced effects observed under arsenic and SLT co-exposure conditions. Live-cell imaging experiments indicated that the DNA damage likely resulted from induction of apoptosis, an observation validated by a lack of exome-wide mutagenesis in response to chronic exposure to arsenic and/or smokeless tobacco. In sum, our integrative omics study provides novel insights into the acute and chronic responses to arsenic and smokeless tobacco (co-)exposure, with both types of responses converging on several key mechanisms associated with cancer hallmark processes. The generated rich catalogue of molecular programs in oral cells regulated by arsenic and smokeless tobacco (co-)exposure may provide bases for future development of biomarkers for use in molecular epidemiology studies of exposed populations at risk of developing oral cancer."

To understand adaptations to this space, we subjected leptomeningeal-metastatic (LeptoM) mouse breast and lung cancers isolated from either the leptomeninges or orthotopic primary sites to ATAC- and RNA-sequencing. When inhabiting the leptomeninges, the LeptoM cells demonstrated transcription downstream of retinoid-X-receptors (RXRs). We found evidence of local retinoic acid (RA) generation in both human leptomeningeal metastasis and mouse models in the form of elevated spinal fluid retinol and expression of RA-generating dehydrogenases within the leptomeningeal microenvironment. Stimulating LeptoM cells with RA induced expression of transcripts encoding de novo fatty acid synthesis pathway enzymes in vitro. In vivo, while deletion of Stra6 did not alter cancer cell leptomeningeal growth, knockout of Rxra/b/g interrupted cancer cell lipid biosynthesis and arrested cancer growth. These observations illustrate a mechanism whereby metastatic cancer cells awake locally-generated developmental cues for metabolically reprograming, suggesting novel therapeutic approaches."

Development and Validation of a Comprehensive Tumor Treating Fields System for Glioblastoma Therapy: From Prototype Design to Preclinical Evaluation,"Xindong,Han,Zhiyong,Xian,Xindong,Han,Zhiyong,Xian,Xindong,Han,Zhiyong,Xian","Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Tumor Treating Fields (TTF) therapy, which uses alternating electric fields to disrupt cancer cell division, has emerged as a promising non-invasive treatment. However, the development and optimization of TTF systems remain challenging, with limited studies detailing the design and practical application of such systems. In this study, we developed a novel TTF prototype, focusing on the design and fabrication of key components such as the electrical signal regulation, transmission and corresponding therapeutic effects. We evaluated the system's efficacy through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. In vitro, we demonstrated significant inhibition of GBM cell proliferation under varying electric field intensities, with stronger fields showing greater efficacy. In vivo studies using a rat glioblastoma model revealed reduced tumor growth, increased apoptosis, and enhanced immune infiltration in the TTF-treated group compared to controls. This comprehensive study provides a valuable reference for TTF system development, offering insights into both the technical design and biological application of TTF therapy, and highlighting its potential for improving GBM treatment outcomes."
Multi-physics simulations reveal hemodynamic impacts of patient-derived fibrosis-related changes in left atrial tissue mechanics,"Alejandro,Christoph,Savannah F,Ashild,Yaacoub,Ahmad,Manuel,Eduardo,Pablo,Oscar,Javier,Gernot,Nazem,Patrick M,Juan Carlos,Alejandro,Christoph,Savannah F,Ashild,Yaacoub,Ahmad,Manuel,Eduardo,Pablo,Oscar,Javier,Gernot,Nazem,Patrick M,Juan Carlos,Alejandro,Christoph,Savannah F,Ashild,Yaacoub,Ahmad,Manuel,Eduardo,Pablo,Oscar,Javier,Gernot,Nazem,Patrick M,Juan Carlos","Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Atrial myopathy, including fibrosis, is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, but the mechanisms underlying this association are poorly understood. Fibrosis modifies myocardial structure, impairing electrical propagation and tissue biomechanics, and creating stagnant flow regions where clots could form. Fibrosis can be mapped non-invasively using late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI). However, fibrosis maps are not currently incorporated into stroke risk calculations or computational electro-mechano-fluidic models. We present multi-physics simulations of left atrial (LA) myocardial motion and hemodynamics using patient-specific anatomies and fibrotic maps from LGE-MRI. We modify tissue stiffness and active tension generation in fibrotic regions and investigate how these changes affect LA flow for different fibrotic burdens. We find that fibrotic regions and, to a lesser extent, non-fibrotic regions experience reduced myocardial strain, resulting in decreased LA emptying fraction consistent with clinical observations. Both fibrotic tissue stiffening and hypocontractility independently reduce LA function, but together, these two alterations cause more pronounced effects than either one alone. Fibrosis significantly alters flow patterns throughout the atrial chamber, and particularly, the filling and emptying jets of the left atrial appendage (LAA). The effects of fibrosis in LA flow are largely captured by the concomitant changes in LA emptying fraction except inside the LAA, where a multi-factorial behavior is observed. This work illustrates how high-fidelity, multi-physics models can be used to study thrombogenesis mechanisms in patient-specific anatomies, shedding light onto the links between atrial fibrosis and ischemic stroke."
A feedforward mechanism for human-like contour integration,"Fenil R.,Talia,George A.,Fenil R.,Talia,George A.,Fenil R.,Talia,George A.","Deep neural network models provide a powerful experimental platform for exploring core mechanisms underlying human visual perception, such as perceptual grouping and contour integration — the process of linking local edge elements to arrive at a unified perceptual representation of a complete contour. Here, we demonstrate that feedforward, nonlinear convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can emulate this aspect of human vision without relying on mechanisms proposed in prior work, such as lateral connections, recurrence, or top-down feedback. We identify two key inductive biases that give rise to human-like contour integration in purely feedforward CNNs: a gradual progression of receptive field sizes with increasing layer depth, and a bias towards relatively straight (gradually curved) contours. While lateral connections, recurrence, and feedback are ubiquitous and important visual processing mechanisms, these results provide a computational existence proof that a feedforward hierarchy is sufficient to implement gestalt “good continuation” mechanisms that detect extended contours in a manner that is consistent with human perception."
Covalent conjugation of glucose oxidase on single-walled carbon nanotubes for glucose sensing,"Hanxuan,Subhasis,Melania,Vitalijs,Ardemis,Hanxuan,Subhasis,Melania,Vitalijs,Ardemis,Hanxuan,Subhasis,Melania,Vitalijs,Ardemis","Glucose sensing and monitoring are crucial for biological and medical applications. Compared to existing methods, real-time detection and long-term monitoring are still required. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have excellent optical properties for sensing applications, which provide the possibility for designing a new generation of glucose sensors. In this study, we describe a method for covalently conjugate glucose oxidase (GOx) on SWCNTs as an optical glucose sensor. The functional groups are introduced by a photocatalytic reaction which acts as the handle for protein loading on SWCNTs. In this sp3 defect reaction, the optical properties of SWCNTs can be maintained. With a convenient bioconjugation reaction, the GOx could be covalently linked with SWCNTs. Compared to the non-covalent immobilization conjugates, the covalent conjugate sensor exhibits a much stronger optical response toward glucose, and the stability of the biosensor also increases in harsh conditions. At the same time, we also report the changing ratio of the original E11 and defected E11* peak during the bioconjugation reaction, which is also inspiring for reaction monitoring on SWCNTs."

Advances in interface tissue engineering require stratified biomaterials able to both provide local instructive signals to support multiple tissue phenotypes while also reducing the risk of strain concentrations and failure at the transition between dissimilar materials. Here, we describe adaptation of a thiolated gelatin (Gel-SH) hydrogel via selective amination of carboxylic acid subunits on the gelatin backbone. The magnitude and kinetics of HRP-mediated primary crosslinking and carbodiimide-mediated secondary crosslinking reactions can be tuned through amination and thiolation of carboxylic acid subunits on the gelatin backbone. We also show that a stratified biomaterial comprised of mineralized (bone-mimetic) and non-mineralized (tendon-mimetic) collagen scaffold compartments linked by an aminated Gel-SH hydrogel demonstrate improved mechanical performance and reduced strain concentrations. Together, these results highlight significant mechanical advantages that can be derived from modifying the gelatin macromer via controlled amination and thiolation and suggest an avenue for tuning the mechanical performance of hydrogel interfaces within stratified biomaterials."
"mTOR variants activation discovers PI3K-like cryptic pocket, expanding allosteric, mutant-selective inhibitor designs","Yonglan,Wengang,Hyunbum,Ruth,Yonglan,Wengang,Hyunbum,Ruth,Yonglan,Wengang,Hyunbum,Ruth","mTOR plays a crucial role in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. We hypothesized that mTOR activation mechanisms driving oncogenesis can advise effective therapeutic designs. To test this, we combined cancer genomic analysis with extensive molecular dynamics simulations of mTOR oncogenic variants. We observed that conformational changes within mTOR kinase domain are associated with multiple mutational activation events. The mutations disturb the α-packing formed by the kαAL, kα3, kα9, kα9b, and kα10 helices in the kinase domain creating cryptic pocket. Its opening correlates with opening of the catalytic cleft, including active site residues realignment, favoring catalysis. The cryptic pocket created by disrupted α-packing coincides with the allosteric pocket in PI3Kα can be harmoniously fitted by the PI3Kα allosteric inhibitor RLY-2608, suggesting that analogous drugs designed based on RLY-2608 can restore the packed α-structure, resulting in mTOR inactive conformation. Our results exemplify that knowledge of detailed kinase activation mechanisms can inform innovative allosteric inhibitor development."
Stress-free Bioprinting of Human Primary and iPSC-derived Islets with Retained Functionality,"Miranda,Ravikumar,Connor,Ben,Ruiqi,Rodrigo M.,Zhenghao,Alejandro,Prashant N.,Ipsita,Miranda,Ravikumar,Connor,Ben,Ruiqi,Rodrigo M.,Zhenghao,Alejandro,Prashant N.,Ipsita,Miranda,Ravikumar,Connor,Ben,Ruiqi,Rodrigo M.,Zhenghao,Alejandro,Prashant N.,Ipsita","Currently, Type 1 diabetes (T1D) can be treated through implantation of allogenic islets, which replenish the beta cell population, however this method requires an extensive post-implantation immunosuppressant regimen. Personalized cellular therapy can address this through implantation of an autologous cell population, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Cellular therapy, however, requires an encapsulation device for implantation, and so to achieve this uniformly with cells in a clinical setting, bioprinting is required. Bioprinting is dependent on having a bioink that is printable, retains structural fidelity after printing, and is supportive of cell type and function. The objective of this study was to design and develop bioinks that were compatible with printing islets. Here, we detail the successful bioprinting of both primary human islets and iPSC-derived islets embedded in an alginate/methylcellulose bioink, with functionality sustained within the construct for both cell lineages. Sc-RNAseq analysis also revealed that printing did not adversely affect the genetic expression and metabolic functionality of the iPSC-derived islets. Importantly, the iPSC-derived islets displayed comparable functionality to the primary islets, indicating the potential to act as a cell source alternative for T1D implantation."
Blood-based Nano-QuIC: Inhibitor-resistant Detection of Seeding Activity in Patients Diagnosed with Parkinson Disease,"Peter R,Hyeonjeong,Manci,Hyerim,Ann M,Pinaki,Danni,Rodolfo,Phillip A,Wolfgang,Peter A,Hye Yoon,Sang-Hyun,Peter R,Hyeonjeong,Manci,Hyerim,Ann M,Pinaki,Danni,Rodolfo,Phillip A,Wolfgang,Peter A,Hye Yoon,Sang-Hyun,Peter R,Hyeonjeong,Manci,Hyerim,Ann M,Pinaki,Danni,Rodolfo,Phillip A,Wolfgang,Peter A,Hye Yoon,Sang-Hyun","A hallmark of α-synucleinopathies (e.g. Parkinson disease) is the misfolding and aggregation of α-synuclein in tissues and biological fluids. Protein amplification assays like real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) are sensitive yet currently limited to semi-invasive sample types such as cerebrospinal fluid because more accessible samples, such as blood, contain inhibitors. Here, we show that Nanoparticle-enhanced Quaking-induced Conversion (Nano-QuIC) can double the speed of reactions spiked with misfolded α-synuclein while increasing sensitivity 100-fold in human plasma. Nano-QuIC detected spike concentrations down to 90 pg/ml in lysed whole blood, while reactions without nanoparticles (RT-QuIC) failed to have any detection due to the presence of strong inhibitors. Moreover, Nano-QuIC showed increased seeding activity in plasma samples from Parkinson disease patients (n=4) versus healthy controls (n=4). This sets the groundwork for the noninvasive diagnostic use of Nano-QuIC, potentially enabling early disease detection and management through blood-based testing."

Clinical trials with ""first generation"" bnAbs used alone or in combination show promising antiviral effects but also highlight that additional engineering of ""enhanced"" antibodies will be required for optimal clinical utility, while preserving or enhancing cGMP manufacturing capability. Here we report the engineering of an anti-CD4 binding-site (CD4bs) bnAb, N49P9.3, purified from the plasma of an HIV elite-neutralizer. Through a series of rational modifications we produced a variant that demonstrates: enhanced potency; superior antiviral activity in combination with other bnAbs; low polyreactivity; and longer circulating half-life. Additional engineering for manufacturing produced a final variant, eN49P9, with properties conducive to cGMP production. Overall, these efforts demonstrate the feasibility of developing enhanced anti-CD4bs bnAbs with greatly improved antiviral properties as well as potential translational value."

We recently began to address these challenges by curating a large collection of cancer scRNA-seq datasets, and leveraging it for systematic analyses of tumor heterogeneity. Here we significantly extend this repository to 124 datasets for over 40 cancer types, together comprising 2,822 samples, with improved data annotations, visualisations and exploration.

Mimicking mechanics: A comparison of meat and meat analogs,"Skyler R.,Ellen,Skyler R.,Ellen,Skyler R.,Ellen","The texture of meat is one of the most important features to mimic when developing meat analogs. Both protein source and processing method impact the texture of the final product. We can distinguish three types of mechanical tests to quantify the textural differences between meat and meat analogs: puncture-type, rheological torsion tests, and classical mechanical tests of tension, compression, and bending. Here we compile the shear force and stiffness values of whole and comminuted meats and meat analogs from the two most popular tests for meat, the Warner-Bratzler shear test and the double-compression texture profile analysis. Our results suggest that, with the right fine-tuning, today's meat analogs are well capable of mimicking the mechanics of real meat. While Warner-Bratzler shear tests and texture profile analysis provide valuable information about the tenderness and sensory perception of meat, both tests suffer from a lack of standardization, which limits cross-study comparisons. Here we provide guidelines to standardize meat testing and report the meat stiffness as the single most informative mechanical parameter. Collecting big standardized data and sharing them with the community at large could empower researchers to harness the power of generative artificial intelligence to inform the systematic development of meat analogs with desired mechanical properties and functions, taste and sensory perception."

Standard treatment includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, but despite a 5-year survival rate of approximately 70%, these therapies often lead to significant neurological damage in the developing brain. This underscores the urgent need for less toxic, more effective therapeutic alternatives. Recent advancements in cancer immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapy, have revolutionized cancer treatment. One promising avenue is the use of Gamma Delta (γδ) T cells, a unique T cell population with potential advantages such as non-alloreactivity, potent tumor cell lysis, and broad antigen recognition.

TGFβ1-TNFα regulated secretion of neutrophil chemokines is independent of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in breast tumor cells,"Shuvasree,Erez,Joseph,Kaleb,Pierre A.,Carole A.,Shuvasree,Erez,Joseph,Kaleb,Pierre A.,Carole A.,Shuvasree,Erez,Joseph,Kaleb,Pierre A.,Carole A.","Neutrophils have tumor-promoting roles in breast cancer and are detected in higher numbers in aggressive breast tumors. How aggressive breast tumors recruit neutrophils remains undefined. Here, we investigated the roles of TGF-β1 and TNF-α in the regulation of neutrophil recruitment by breast cancer cells. TGF-β1 and TNF-α are pro-inflammatory factors upregulated in breast tumors and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT), a process linked to cancer cell aggressiveness. We report that, as expected, dual treatment with TGF-β1 and TNF-α induces EMT signatures in premalignant M2 cells, which are part of the MCF10A breast cancer progression model. Conditioned media (CM) harvested from M2 cells treated with TGF-β1/TNF-α gives rise to amplified neutrophil chemotaxis compared to CM from control M2 cells. This response correlates with higher levels of the neutrophil chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL8 and is significantly attenuated in the presence of a CXCL8-neutralizing antibody. Furthermore, we found that secretion of CXCL1 and CXCL8 from treated M2 cells depends on p38MAPK activity. By combining gene editing, immunological and biochemical approaches, we show that the regulation of neutrophil recruitment and EMT signatures are not mechanistically linked in treated M2 cells. Finally, analysis of publicly available cancer cell line transcriptomic databases revealed a significant correlation between CXCL8 and TGF-β1/TNF-α-regulated or effector genes in breast cancer. Together, our findings establish a novel role for the TGF-β1/TNF-α/p38 MAPK signaling axis in regulating neutrophil recruitment in breast cancer, independent of TGF-β1/TNF-α regulated EMT."
Identification of Phosphotyrosine-Mutant Desmin in Human Pancreatic Cancer,"Nancy C,Costel C,Matthew C,Andrew A,Jon J,Nancy C,Costel C,Matthew C,Andrew A,Jon J,Nancy C,Costel C,Matthew C,Andrew A,Jon J","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a deadly cancer with a 5-year survival rate of ~12%, is characterized by frequently mutated KRAS, early metastasis, and extensive desmoplasia. The latter, a formation of dense fibrotic tissue generated by pancreatic stellar cells (PSC) and tumor cells, makes up to 80% of the tumor mass and often leads to treatment failure. To search for novel protein biomarkers for actionable tyrosine kinase drivers of PDAC, we used a combination of two orthogonal protein analysis methods, western blotting (WB) and mass spectrometry (MS). That is, we used 1D/2D phosphotyrosine (pTyr) WB in combination with nano liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (NanoLC-MS/MS) to analyze homogenates of 6 PDAC tumor samples and 5 normal adjacent tissue controls. Surprisingly, we found a novel, abundant 55 kDa pTyr-protein in 2/6 tumor samples and identified it as mutated pTyr-desmin. Further proteomics analysis of the purified protein cut from multiple Coomassie-stained 2D gels revealed that the mutant amino acid, tyrosine (D399Y), is phosphorylated (pTyr). A possible role for mutant pTyr-desmin in PDAC metastasis is discussed, along with peptide inhibitor drugs."

Recognition and Cleavage of Human tRNA Methyltransferase TRMT1 by the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease,"Angel,Xuhang,Saba,Sophie,Evan P,Lucie,Yingkai,Jeffrey S,Angel,Xuhang,Saba,Sophie,Evan P,Lucie,Yingkai,Jeffrey S,Angel,Xuhang,Saba,Sophie,Evan P,Lucie,Yingkai,Jeffrey S","The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro, or Nsp5) is critical for the production of functional viral proteins during infection and, like many viral proteases, can also target host proteins to subvert their cellular functions. Here, we show that the human tRNA methyltransferase TRMT1 can be recognized and cleaved by SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. TRMT1 installs the N2,N2-dimethylguanosine (m2,2G) modification on mammalian tRNAs, which promotes global protein synthesis and cellular redox homeostasis. We find that Mpro can cleave endogenous TRMT1 in human cell lysate, resulting in removal of the TRMT1 zinc finger domain. TRMT1 proteolysis results in elimination of TRMT1 tRNA methyltransferase activity and reduced tRNA binding affinity. Evolutionary analysis shows that the TRMT1 cleavage site is highly conserved in mammals, except in Muroidea, where TRMT1 is likely resistant to cleavage. In primates, regions outside the cleavage site with rapid evolution could indicate adaptation to ancient viral pathogens.  Furthermore, we determined the structure of a TRMT1 peptide in complex with Mpro, revealing a substrate binding conformation distinct from the majority of available Mpro-peptide complexes. Kinetic parameters for peptide cleavage show that the TRMT1(526-536) sequence is cleaved with comparable efficiency to the Mpro-targeted nsp8/9 viral cleavage site. Mutagenesis studies and molecular dynamics simulations together indicate that kinetic discrimination occurs during a later step of Mpro-mediated proteolysis that follows substrate binding. Our results provide new information about the structural basis for Mpro substrate recognition and cleavage, the functional roles of the TRMT1 zinc finger domain in tRNA binding and modification, and the regulation of TRMT1 activity by SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. These studies could inform future therapeutic design targeting Mpro and raise the possibility that proteolysis of human TRMT1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection suppresses protein translation and oxidative stress response to impact viral pathogenesis."
Mapping the Temporal Landscape of Breast Cancer Using Epigenetic Entropy,"Daniel L.,Shannon T.,Graham J.,Lars J.,E. Shelley,Jeffrey R.,Darryl,Marc D.,Daniel L.,Shannon T.,Graham J.,Lars J.,E. Shelley,Jeffrey R.,Darryl,Marc D.,Daniel L.,Shannon T.,Graham J.,Lars J.,E. Shelley,Jeffrey R.,Darryl,Marc D.","Although generally unknown, the age of a newly diagnosed tumor encodes valuable etiologic and prognostic information. Here, we estimate the age of breast cancers, defined as the time from the start of growth to detection, using a measure of epigenetic entropy derived from genome-wide methylation arrays. Based on an ensemble of neutrally fluctuating CpG (fCpG) sites, this stochastic epigenetic clock differs from conventional clocks that measure age-related increases in methylation. We show that younger tumors exhibit hallmarks of aggressiveness, such as increased proliferation and genomic instability, whereas older tumors are characterized by elevated immune infiltration, indicative of enhanced immune surveillance. These findings suggest that the clock captures a tumor’s effective growth rate resulting from the evolutionary-ecological competition between intrinsic growth potential and external systemic pressures. Because of the clock’s ability to delineate old and stable from young and aggressive tumors, it has potential applications in risk stratification of early-stage breast cancers and guiding early detection efforts."
OpenASO: RNA Rescue—designing splice-modulating antisense oligonucleotides through community science,"Victor,Martin,Jill,Jonathan,Jennifer,Guillermo,Eterna,Rhiju,Jeremy,Michael,Victor,Martin,Jill,Jonathan,Jennifer,Guillermo,Eterna,Rhiju,Jeremy,Michael,Victor,Martin,Jill,Jonathan,Jennifer,Guillermo,Eterna,Rhiju,Jeremy,Michael","Splice-modulating antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are precision RNA-based drugs that are becoming an established modality to treat human disease. Previously, we reported the discovery of ASOs that target a novel, putative intronic RNA structure to rescue splicing of multiple pathogenic variants of F8 exon 16 that cause hemophilia A. However, the conventional approach to discovering splice-modulating ASOs is both laborious and expensive. Here, we describe an alternative paradigm that integrates data-driven RNA structure prediction and community science to discover splice-modulating ASOs. Using a splicing-deficient pathogenic variant of F8 exon 16 as a model, we show that 25% of the top-scoring molecules designed in the Eterna OpenASO challenge have a statistically significant impact on enhancing exon 16 splicing. Additionally, we show that a distinct combination of ASOs designed by Eterna players can additively enhance the inclusion of the splicing-deficient exon 16 variant. Together, our data suggests that crowdsourcing designs from a community of citizen scientists may accelerate the discovery of splice-modulating ASOs with potential to treat human disease."
"Calcium-modulated cis and trans E-cadherin EC1-2 interactions play a key role in formation, dynamics and plasticity of cadherin junctions","Patrick,Patrick,Patrick","Classical cadherins are ubiquitous calcium-dependent adhesive glycoproteins required in junction formation in metazoans. Calcium ions are essential for cadherin biological activity, but how they act in synergy is still a matter of controversy. We investigated by cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, a biomimetic system consisting of liposomes decorated with the two first E-cadherin extracellular modules, previously reported as functionally essential in junction formation. We showed that E-cadherin extracellular modules 1 and 2 are sufficient to form junctions in presence of calcium. Together with the first adhesive contacts, we observed the formation of cadherin patches and quasi-crystalline structures on the free surface of proteoliposomes suggesting that calcium complexation induces the self-interaction of the E-cadherin extracellular modules 1 and 2 through cis interactions. We propose that these calcium-dependent cadherin nanoplatforms, by facilitating the formation frequency of trans interactions, most probably favor the formation of junctions. We also observed a cooperative effect between trans and cis interactions leading to the protein depletion of liposome surfaces. Additionally, Cryo-electron tomography experiments performed on extracellular E-cadherin modules 1 and 2-mediated junctions revealed the coexistence of different molecular arrangements previously described from crystallography studies. Thus, this study provides a new insight into biophysical mechanisms underlying how calcium binding modulates cadherin adhesive function, in showing that E-cadherin 1 and 2 modules play a key role through their intrinsic ability to form multiple calcium-dependent cis and trans interactions, in the formation of cadherin junctions contributing to the dynamics and plasticity of cadherin-mediated cell junctions."
Mechanistic Insights into Alcohol-Induced DNA Crosslink Repair by the Fanconi Anemia Nuclease Slx4-Xpf-Ercc1,"Jana,Milan,Andrea,Anthony,Evzen,Radim,Jan,Jana,Milan,Andrea,Anthony,Evzen,Radim,Jan,Jana,Milan,Andrea,Anthony,Evzen,Radim,Jan","During cell division, DNA replication stalls upon alcohol-derived interstrand crosslink, employing DNA repair pathways. Acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of alcohol, can induce DNA crosslinks between complementary DNA strands, causing significant genomic instability. The repair of acetaldehyde DNA crosslinks (AA-ICLs) is vital for maintaining genome integrity and preventing mutagenic events. The Fanconi anemia (FA) repair pathway's involvement in fixing the AA-ICLs is crucial, ensuring cellular homeostasis and safeguarding genomic stability. Dysregulation of the FA pathway has been linked to Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, including acetaldehyde. However, the precise mechanism of the repair and incision of AA-ICLs is unknown. Here, we demonstrate the role of the FA pathway nuclease SLX4-XPF-ERCC1 (SXE) in the repair of AA-ICL. We have generated site-specific AA-ICL within the replication fork, and we found SXE to excise the crosslink from the replication fork, bringing evidence of its role in the repair of alcohol-induced DNA lesions. This nuclease complex performs two precise incisions around the lesion. We also demonstrate that the SXE nuclease excises an abasic site interstrand crosslink in a similar manner. Given the evidence in conjunction with previous repair studies that have been conducted, our work suggests that SXE is a versatile nuclease complex."

Despite low sequence identity, their classification into families is feasible using structural homology. In this study, we have elucidated the structures of the two effectors Mycgr3-91409 and Zt-NIP1 from the wheat fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici using X-ray crystallography and NMR. These proteins shared structural homology with, respectively, KP6alpha and KP4 killer toxins, encoded by UmV dsRNA viruses infecting the corn fungal pathogen Ustilago maydis. Consequently, Zt-Mycgr3-91409 and Zt-NIP1 were renamed Zt-KP6-1 and Zt-KP4-1. Orthologs and paralogs of Zt-KP6-1 and Zt-KP4-1 were identified in Zymoseptoria species, but not in other fungi, with the exception of ECP2 effectors related to Zt-KP4-1. A novel pipeline relying on Foldseek and cysteine-pattern constrained HMM searches identified a large number of proteins structurally related to Zt-KP6-1 and Zt-KP4-1 in fungi, and to Zt-KP4-1 in plants. These proteins were classified into distinct structural super families (4 KP4 and 3 KP6) including effectors not known as structurally related to KP4 (ECP2) or KP6 (BAS4). The biological activities of Zt-KP6-1 and Zt-KP4-1 were assessed on plants and fungi. They did not induce symptoms on wheat leaves. However, they inhibited the growth of Botrytis cinerea and Z. tritici, demonstrating their toxicity to fungi. These results highlight the importance of structure determination of effectors for their classification and the prediction of their function."

However, recent reports have shown that some TRIMs lack detectable ubiquitination activity in isolation, despite containing a RING domain. Here, we present parallel in cellulo, in vitro, and in silico structure-function analyses of the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and RING domain structural characteristics of whole TRIM protein family. In-depth follow-up studies of this comprehensive dataset reveals a number of pseudoligases, whose RING domains have structurally diverged at either the homodimerisation or E2~ubiquitin interfaces, thereby disrupting their ability to catalyse ubiquitin transfer. Together, these data raise intriguing open questions regarding the unknown TRIM functions in physiology and disease."
Assessing substrate scope of the cyclodehydratase LynD by mRNA display-enabled machine learning models,"Emma G,Henry,Jarrett M,Brian,Albert,Emma G,Henry,Jarrett M,Brian,Albert,Emma G,Henry,Jarrett M,Brian,Albert","Many of the biosynthetic pathways for ribosomal synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) natural products make use of multi-domain enzymes with separate recruitment and catalysis domains that separately bind and modify peptide substrates.  This division of labor allows RiPP enzymes to use relatively open and promiscuous active sites to perform chemistry at multiple residues within a peptide substrate seemingly regardless of the surrounding context.  Defining, measuring, and predicting the seemingly broad substrate promiscuity of RiPPs necessitates high throughput assays, capable of assessing activity against very large libraries of peptides.  Using mRNA display, a high throughput peptide display technology, we examine the substrate promiscuity of the RiPP cyclodehydratase, LynD.  The vast substrate profiling that can be done with mRNA display enables the construction of deep learning models for accurate prediction of substrate processing by LynD.  These models further inform on epistatic interactions involved in enzymatic processing.  This work will facilitate the further elucidation of other RiPP enzymes and enable their use in the modification of mRNA display libraries for selection of modified peptide-based inhibitors and therapeutics"

However, current hydrophilic polymer coatings and films have significant drawbacks, including swelling and delamination. To address these issues, we modified hydroxyethyl cellulose with thioether groups to generate an oxidation-responsive polymer, HECMTP. HECMTP readily dissolves in green solvents and can be fabricated as coatings or films with tunable thicknesses. HECMTP coatings effectively scavenge hydrogen peroxide, resulting in conversion of thioether groups to sulfoxide groups on the polymer chain. Oxidation-driven, hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic transitions that are isolated to the surface of HECMTP coatings under physiologically relevant conditions increase wettability, decrease stiffness, and reduce protein adsorption to generate a non-fouling interface with minimal coating delamination or swelling. HECMTP can be used in diverse optical applications and permits oxidation-responsive, controlled drug release. HECMTP films are non-resorbable in vivo and evoke minimal foreign body responses. These results highlight the versatility of HECMTP and support its incorporation into chronically implanted medical devices."

In this work, we provide direct physiological, biochemical, and structural evidence for the anaerobic removal of iron from heme by HmuS, a de-chelatase that deconstructs heme to PPIX and Fe(II). We show that heme can be used as a sole iron source by B theta, yielding PPIX, and that hmuS inactivation under these conditions is lethal. Iron removal from heme depends on the B theta membrane fraction, NADH, and O2 exclusion. Absorbance spectra indicate that heterologously expressed HmuS is isolated with a non-substrate heme bound and can accommodate multiple heme equivalents under saturating conditions. Solution of the cryoEM structure reveals heme and two cations at sites that are conserved across the HmuS family and the chelatase superfamily, respectively. The proposed structure-based mechanism for iron removal further links biosynthetic and biodegradative pathways for heme, chlorophyll, and vitamin B12, 3 ancient and biologically crucial metallocofactors."
Study of Plasma Adiponectin Levels in Patients with Metabolic Syndrome and Therapeutic Indication in Bangladesh,"Salina Shaheen,Reaz,Md Taohid,Ariful,Md. Motiar,M.,Md. Wasim,Md. Sakil,Md.

Sohel,Mohammad Amirul","Background: The metabolic syndrome (Met-S) is a cluster of some interrelated common clinical disorders, including central obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and glucose intolerance. Central obesity, accompanied by insulin resistance, is a key factor for the development of metabolic syndrome. Adiponectin is an adipose-specific plasma protein, secreted from adipocyte with anti-atherogenic and insulin-sensitizing activities.
Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the relationship of plasma adiponectin levels with metabolic syndrome, related disorders and it's drug repurposing through in silico approach.
Materials and Methods: For this study, 269 individuals were recruited with written consent. The participants were selected based on their full medical history, clinical examination, and laboratory reports. Anthropometric measurements as well as blood pressure was measured before sample collection. Fasting blood samples were collected for the estimation of lipid profile, blood glucose, and serum adiponectin levels.
Results: Our results show that the adiponectin levels in the subjects with Met-S were significantly lower than those of without Met-S (p <0.0001). Among the metabolic syndrome risk factors, adiponectin levels were associated with hypertriglyceridemia and reduced HDL-cholesterol (p<0.0001). Three drugs (Saquinavir, Candesartan and Glimepiride) were suggested to control the plasma adiponectin level in the subjects with Met-S.
Conclusions: Since the plasma adiponectin levels are significantly lower in patients with Met-S, it might be used as diagnostic & prognostic marker for Met-S disorder and adiponectin targeted drugs might be minimize the Met-S of the subjects."
Anterior hypothalamic nucleus drives distinct defensive responses through cell-type-specific activity,"Cindy Yookyung,Jessica Sofia,Hannah,Jee Yoon,Jun Chul,Cindy Yookyung,Jessica Sofia,Hannah,Jee Yoon,Jun Chul,Cindy Yookyung,Jessica Sofia,Hannah,Jee Yoon,Jun Chul","Innate defensive behaviors, such as freezing, fleeing, and fighting, are essential for survival, enabling animals to effectively respond to predatory threats. These behaviors involve a complex interplay of sensory processing, decision-making, and motor output. As a core component of the medial hypothalamic defense system, the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHN) is a key brain region implicated in orchestrating innate defensive responses. Although the AHN is predominantly GABAergic, it also contains a smaller population of excitatory neurons, reflecting a sophisticated balance between inhibitory and excitatory signaling within this region. However, despite its importance, the specific behavioral functions of these diverse neuronal populations have not been systemically examined. In this study, we utilized fiber photometry and optogenetic stimulation to investigate the roles of AHN GABAergic, glutamatergic, and CaMKIIa+ neuronal activities in mediating innate defensive behaviors. Our results indicate that AHN GABAergic neurons mediate anxiety-associated investigatory behaviors, likely facilitating risk assessment during the pre-encounter stage. Conversely, AHN glutamatergic neurons drive escape initiation and freezing responses associated with the post-encounter stage. The AHN CaMKIIa+ neurons, which exhibit significant heterogeneity, suggest a more nuanced role, potentially balancing escape and freezing responses. By elucidating the functional specialization of different AHN neuron subtypes, this study provides a foundation for future investigations into the neural circuits underlying innate defensive behaviors and its dysregulation in neuropsychiatric conditions characterized by dysregulated responses to threats, such as PTSD and panic disorder."
"Learning Impairments in , mice on an Audio-Visual Temporal Pattern Discrimination Task","William,Sam,Megan,Anubhuti,William,Sam,Megan,Anubhuti,William,Sam,Megan,Anubhuti","Estimating time and making predictions is integral to our experience of the world. Given the importance of timing to most behaviors, disruptions in temporal processing and timed performance are reported in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders such as Schizophrenia, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), and Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Symptoms that implicitly include disruption in timing are atypical turn-taking during social interactions, unusual verbal intonations, poor reading, speech and language skills, inattention, delays in learning, and difficulties making predictions. Currently, there are no viable treatments for these symptoms, the reason being the underlying neural dysfunction that contributes to timing deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders is unknown. To address this unknown, we have designed a novel Temporal Pattern Discrimination Task (TPSD) for awake-behaving mice. Stimuli consist of audiovisual stimuli that differ in duration. Compared to Wild-Type (WT) mice, , mice, a well-established mouse model of FXS, showed significant impairment in learning the TPSD task, as evidenced by reduced discriminability indices and atypical licking patterns. Often sensory information is multimodal and indeed studies show that learning in humans and rodents improves with multimodal stimuli than with unimodal stimuli. To test how the multimodal nature of stimuli impacted performance of , mice, following training on the audiovisual stimuli, we tested mice on audio-only or visual-only stimuli. While WT mice showed significant disruption in performance when tested on unimodal stimuli, , mice displayed equivalent performance on visual-only stimuli when compared to the multimodal task. Our novel task captures timing difficulties and multisensory integration issues in , mice and provides an assay to examine the associated neural dysfunction."

Both methods usually involve dead animals."
Longitudinal evidence for the emergence of multiple intelligences in assistance dog puppies,"Hannah,Morgan,Candler,Kara,Vanessa,Emily,Brenda,Theadora,Laura,Ashton,Margaret,Brian,Hannah,Morgan,Candler,Kara,Vanessa,Emily,Brenda,Theadora,Laura,Ashton,Margaret,Brian,Hannah,Morgan,Candler,Kara,Vanessa,Emily,Brenda,Theadora,Laura,Ashton,Margaret,Brian","Cognitive test batteries suggest that adult dogs have different types of cognitive abilities that vary independently. In the current study, we tested puppies repeatedly over a crucial period of development to explore the timing and rate at which these different cognitive skills develop. Service dog puppies (n = 113), raised using two different socialization strategies, were either tested longitudinally (n =91) or at a single time point (n = 22). Subjects tested longitudinally participated in the battery every two weeks during and just beyond their final period of rapid brain growth (from approximately 8-20 weeks of age). Control puppies only participated in the test battery once, which allowed us to evaluate the impact of repeated testing. In support of the multiple intelligences hypothesis (MIH), cognitive skills emerged at different points across the testing period, not simultaneously. Maturational patterns also varied between cognitive skills, with puppies showing adult-like performance on some tasks only weeks after a skill emerged, while never achieving adult performance in others. Differences in rearing strategy did not lead to differences in developmental patterns while, in some cases, repeated testing did. Overall, our findings provide strong support for the MIH by demonstrating differentiated development across the cognitive abilities tested."

Small numbers of Burrowing Owls have been observed and recorded since 2008 in the winter season in Cesar Chavez Park, a 36-ha peninsula that forms part of the waterfront of the City of Berkeley. The relative ease of observation in this setting allows study of their arrival and departure dates, selection of micro-habitats, tolerance of human presence, behavior in inclement weather, and response to avian and canine predator threats. Viewed over a decade, fewer owls arrived, arrived later, left earlier, and spent less time in residence. Most owls settled in shoreline rip-rap or in tall vegetation; only one fourth settled in short grass. Owls chose exposure to rain for as long as two days.

"Environmental Enrichment Reduces ,-Related Anxiety and Attention Deficits but Not Impulsivity","Barbara D.,William H.J.,Matthew O.,Barbara D.,William H.J.,Matthew O.,Barbara D.,William H.J.,Matthew O.","Environmental factors play a role in the development and severity of neuropsychiatric disorders. Externalizing disorders (EDs) are linked to genetic and environmental factors and frequently co-occur with internalizing disorders (ID), such as anxiety. Individuals experiencing both ED/ID are often among the most likely to seek healthcare services, as this co-occurrence is associated with more severe symptomatology and greater functional impairment. Here, we investigate the role of environmental enrichment (EE) on a gene associated with impulsivity and attention deficits in zebrafish, ,. Zebrafish were reared in either standard or enriched environments (from 15 days-post fertilization), and attention, impulsivity, and anxiety-related phenotypes were assessed at adult stages (4 months-post fertilization) using the open field test and 5-choice serial reaction time task. EE mitigated anxiety-related behaviors in , knockouts, normalizing locomotor patterns and decreasing thigmotaxis. Although attention deficits were reduced in , fish reared in EE, impulsive behaviors were not. Together, these findings suggest that while EE can alleviate some externalizing and internalizing phenotypes in zebrafish, impulsivity remains resistant to environmental modification. This study suggests that impulsivity is a stable trait in , fish, but highlights the importance of EE in mitigating some externalizing and internalizing symptoms."
Three-fold Quantum Leap in Butterfly Nectar Knowledge: A Comprehensive Study Revolutionizing Conservation Strategies,"Susan C.,Susan C.,Susan C.","This study addresses a critical gap in butterfly conservation: the lack of comprehensive data on nectar plants preferred by US butterflies. The research presented has dramatically improved our understanding, increasing knowledge of nectar plant genera used by butterflies from representing just 25% of all species to an impressive 90%, a more than three-fold or 260% improvement in species representation. This substantial expansion in data has significant implications for conservation strategies and will shift our approach to butterfly habitat restoration. A seven-year longitudinal study of adult butterfly nectaring behavior resulted in over 12,000 detailed records of nectar plant usage by US butterflies. This curated dataset provides a valuable resource with significant implications for all levels of effort directed at butterfly conservation."

"Lack of circadian entrainment and limited nocturnal plasticity in response to a cyclic aversive stimulus in a diurnal rodent, the antelope ground squirrel (,)","Victor Y.,G.J.,Horacio O.,Victor Y.,G.J.,Horacio O.,Victor Y.,G.J.,Horacio O.","Recent studies have shown that cyclic aversive stimuli, such as random footshocks, act as a nonphotic zeitgeber to entrain circadian behaviors in nocturnal rodents, a pattern termed “fear entrainment”. However, it remains unknown whether diurnal species exhibit similar plasticity in behavioral timing. This study aimed to determine if antelope ground squirrels (, AGS), a naturally diurnal rodent, can also shift their activity patterns to cyclic aversive stimuli. We conducted two experiments with 20 AGS housed in custom cages featuring a safe nesting area and a separate foraging area (for feeding and drinking), rendered aversive by presentation of unsignaled, time-specific footshocks. In the first experiment, animals were subjected to a 12:12 light-dark (LD) cycle. One group experienced aversion during the light phase, while the control group received the same treatment during the dark phase. In the second experiment, a 16:8 LD cycle was used, and animals were divided into three groups with the foraging area rendered aversive either during the first or second half of the light phase or during the dark phase. Following each of these treatments, animals were released into constant darkness (DD) to assess the phase and period of free-running rhythms. Contrary to previous findings in nocturnal rodents, AGS did not exhibit consistent shifts in activity to avoid footshocks. Most animals maintained their normal diurnal activity, with only minor and inconsistent phase shifts. In experiment two, animals exposed to footshocks during half of the light phase also failed to reliably shift activity to the opposite “safe” portion of the light phase. Together, these findings show AGS lack the ability to entrain to cyclic aversive stimuli or become nocturnal; this result suggests a lack of substantial plasticity in activity timing. These results highlight the importance of considering species-specific differences in nonphotic circadian entrainment and temporal niche plasticity."
Detect+Track: Robust and flexible software tools for improved tracking and behavioural analysis of fish,"Abhishek,Natalia,Graham K.,Andrew,Cait,Abhishek,Natalia,Graham K.,Andrew,Cait,Abhishek,Natalia,Graham K.,Andrew,Cait","Developments in automated animal behavioural analysis software are increasing the efficiency of data collection and improving the standardization of behavioural measurements. There are now several open-source tools for tracking laboratory animals, but often these are only accurate under limited conditions (,.,. uniform lighting and background, uncluttered scenes, unobstructed focal animal). Tracking fish presents a particular challenge for these tools because movement at the water’s surface introduces significant noise. Partial occlusion of the focal animal can also be troublesome, particularly when tracking the whole organism. But identifying the position of an animal is only part of the task – analysing the movement of the animal relative to their environment and experimental context is often what provides information about their behaviour. Therefore, the automated detection of physical objects and boundaries would also be beneficial, but this feature is not commonly incorporated into existing tracking software. Here we describe a video processing method that uses a range of computer vision algorithms (,.,. object detector and tracker, optical flow, parallel plane homology) and computational geometry techniques (,.,. Voronoi tessellation) to analyse the movement behaviour of fish in response to experimental stimuli. A behavioural experiment, which involved tracking a fish’s trajectory through a field of obstacles, motivated our development of a set of tools that: (1) measure an animal’s trajectory, (2) record obstacle position, and (3) detect when the fish passed through ‘virtual gates’ between adjacent obstacles and/or the aquarium wall. We have introduced a novel Detect+Track approach that significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of animal tracking, overcoming some of the limitations of existing tools and providing a more reliable solution for complex experimental conditions. Our workflow is divided into several discrete steps, and provides a set of modular software building blocks that can be adapted to analyse other experimental designs. A detailed tutorial is provided, together with all the data and code required to reproduce our results."
Effects of social position on subsequent courtship and mating activity in an African cichlid,"Anastasia,Sara,Lakshita,Avraham Zion,S.G.,Anastasia,Sara,Lakshita,Avraham Zion,S.G.,Anastasia,Sara,Lakshita,Avraham Zion,S.G.","Within social hierarchies, rank can be dynamic and modulated by changes in molecular and/or physiological substrates. Here, we sought to better understand how social environment and rank shape male spawning behaviors and outcomes in African cichlid fish ,. First, using a social dyad paradigm, we generated territorial (T)/ Non-territorial (NT) male pairs. After establishing a stable social hierarchy, the behaviors of the Ts and NTs were recorded and scored. Afterward, pairs were separated and individually moved into a spawning phase, which consisted of a new tank with novel females and no other males where their behaviors were scored. While previous studies have shown how territorial/non-territorial/ascending/descending males have unique behavioral profiles, we sought to deepen this interpretation with a focus on the latency of decision-making and transition matrices representing enriched sequences of behavior. We found that while the courtship behaviors are shared between stably territorial and ascending males in the spawning phase, only the animals that were territorial in the dyad phase were the ones that succeeded in being reproductive in the subsequent 16 hour spawning phase."
Novel and optimized mouse behavior enabled by fully autonomous HABITS: Home-cage Assisted Behavioral Innovation and Testing System,"Bowen,Penghai,Haoze,Yueming,Kedi,Yaoyao,Bowen,Penghai,Haoze,Yueming,Kedi,Yaoyao,Bowen,Penghai,Haoze,Yueming,Kedi,Yaoyao","Mice are among the most prevalent animal models in neuroscience, leveraging the extensive physiological, imaging and genetic tools available for studying their brain. However, the development of new behavioral paradigms for mice has been laborious and inconsistent, impeding the investigation of complex cognition. Here, we present a home-cage assisted mouse behavioral innovation and testing system (HABITS), enables free-moving mice learn challenging cognitive behaviors in their home-cage without any human involvement. Supported by the microcontroller-based general programming framework, we have not only replicated established paradigms in current neuroscience research but also developed several novel paradigms previously unexplored in mice, resulting in more than 300 mice tested in various cognition functions. Through a machine-teaching approach, HABITS can comprehensively optimize the presentation of stimuli and modalities for trials, leading to more efficient training and higher-quality behavioral outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first instance where mouse behavior has been systematically optimized by an algorithmic approach. Our results open a new approach for mouse behavior and demonstrate the novel and optimized cognitions to be investigated at the neural level."
Integration of parallel pathways for flight control in a hawkmoth reflects prevalence and relevance of natural visual cues,"Ronja,Rebecca,Anna,Ronja,Rebecca,Anna,Ronja,Rebecca,Anna","An animal’s behaviour is the result of multiple neural pathways acting in parallel, receiving information across and within sensory modalities at the same time. How these pathways are integrated, particularly when their individual outputs are in conflict, is key to understanding complex natural behaviours. We investigated this question in the visually guided flight of the hummingbird hawkmoth ,. These insects were recently shown to partition their visual field, using ventrolateral optic-flow cues to guide their flight like most insects, while the same stimuli in the dorsal visual field evoke a novel directional response. Using behavioural experiments which set the two pathways into conflict, we tested whether and how the ventrolateral and dorsal pathway integrate to guide hawkmoth flight. Combined with environmental imaging we demonstrate that the partitioning of the visual field followed the prevalence of visual cues in the hawkmoths’ natural habitats, while the integration hierarchy of the two pathways matched the relevance of these cues for the animals’ flight safety, rather than their magnitude in the experimental setup or in natural habitats. These results provide new mechanistic insights into the vision-based flight control of insects, and link these to their natural context. We anticipate our findings to be the starting point for comparative investigations into parallel pathways for flight guidance in insects from differently structured natural habitats."

Pulvinar perturbation causes functional reorganization of visual attentional information in posterior parietal cortex,"Fang-Chi,Feng-Kuei,Erin L.,Rebecca D.,Fang-Chi,Feng-Kuei,Erin L.,Rebecca D.,Fang-Chi,Feng-Kuei,Erin L.,Rebecca D.","The pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus (PUL) is a higher-order thalamic relay and the main visual extrageniculate thalamic nucleus. Evidence suggests the PUL coordinates information processing across cortical areas involved in visual perception and attention. Other findings suggest the PUL may also influence higher-order cognitive processes, such as attentional control, through interactions with connected neocortical areas like the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). We hypothesized that PUL input to the dorsal and caudal PPC (DPPC and CPPC) enhances visuospatial processing and attention. To test this hypothesis, we recorded neuronal activity in the PUL, DPPC, and CPPC of freely behaving rats performing the visuospatial attention (VSA) task while optogenetically suppressing PUL neurons on some trials. We found that PUL manipulation did not affect behavioral performance, but reorganized neural codes in DPPC and CPPC as well as PUL itself."
"Object permanence in domestic cats (,) using violation-of-expectancy by owner and stranger","Jemma,Jordan S.,David A.,Jemma,Jordan S.,David A.,Jemma,Jordan S.,David A.","Object permanence, the understanding that objects continue to exist while out of sight, has been extensively researched in human infants and animals. Cats have been shown to reach Stage 5 object permanence by passing successive visible displacement tests, but their understanding of Stage 6 object permanence is less clear. We tested 18 domestic cats on their understanding of Stage 4 (single visible displacement; SVD) and Stage 6 (invisible displacement; IVD) of object permanence in their home environment. Additionally, we investigated how person familiarity may influence study engagement. In SVD tests, the box manipulator (owner or researcher) hid a toy in one of two cardboard boxes for the cat to find. In IVD tests, we implemented a violation-of-expectancy procedure in which the box manipulator showed a toy re-appearing out of either a) the same box it was hidden in (consistent trials) or b) the box it was not hidden in (violation trials). Approximately half of the cats (56%) did not find the hidden toy in SVD trials, with 42% of these cats not attempting to find the toy, despite previous research demonstrating that cats can retrieve hidden objects in successive SVD tests. No predictors significantly influenced whether cats found the toy, or which box was checked first (toy or empty box). In IVD trials, we unexpectedly found that cats were more likely to play with and had longer gaze durations towards the toy and display more toy box-directed behaviours in consistent trials than violation trials. Similarly, we found that cats were more likely to display toy and empty box- directed behaviours in trials where the researcher acted as the box manipulator. Other factors such as breed, outdoor access, cat sex and the first person to act as the box manipulator also influenced toy-directed behaviours. We discuss the complexity of person familiarity in research contexts and highlight some methodological challenges in studying cat cognition."
Discovering Cognitive Strategies with Tiny Recurrent Neural Networks,"Li,Marcus K.,Marcelo G.,Li,Marcus K.,Marcelo G.,Li,Marcus K.,Marcelo G.","Normative modeling frameworks such as Bayesian inference and reinforcement learning provide valuable insights into the fundamental principles governing adaptive behavior. While these frameworks are valued for their simplicity and interpretability, their reliance on few parameters often limits their ability to capture realistic biological behavior, leading to cycles of handcrafted adjustments that are prone to research subjectivity. Here, we present a novel modeling approach leveraging recurrent neural networks to discover the cognitive algorithms governing biological decision-making. We show that neural networks with just 1-4 units often outperform classical cognitive models and match larger neural networks in predicting the choices of individual animals and humans across six well-studied reward learning tasks. Critically, we then interpret the trained networks using dynamical systems concepts, enabling a unified comparison of cognitive models and revealing detailed mechanisms underlying choice behavior. Our approach also estimates the dimensionality of behavior and offers insights into algorithms implemented by AI agents trained in a meta-reinforcement learning setting. Overall, we present a systematic approach for discovering interpretable cognitive strategies in decision-making, offering insights into neural mechanisms and a foundation for studying both healthy and dysfunctional cognition."

SEXUAL-DIMORPHISM IN VISUALLY GUIDED APPROACH BEHAVIOR EMERGES UNIQUELY DURING ADOLESCENCE,"Rocio,Kelsey,Ting,Jennifer L.,Rocio,Kelsey,Ting,Jennifer L.,Rocio,Kelsey,Ting,Jennifer L.","Studying prey capture behavior in mice offers a fruitful platform for understanding how ecologically relevant visual stimuli are differentially processed by the brain throughout life. For example, specific visual stimuli that indicate prey and that naturally draw appetitive orienting in the adult may be interpreted differently or evoke distinct behaviors during development. What are the neural mechanisms that might allow an animal to flexibly couple the same stimulus information to distinct behavioral outcomes as a function of developmental needs? To begin to address this important question, we quantified visually evoked orienting behaviors between adolescent and adult C57BL6/J mice of both sexes under the natural prey capture context compared to responses in our established virtual motion stimulus paradigm, C-SPOT. Most surprisingly, we discovered that female versus male adolescent mice have opposing innate behavioral biases evoked by the same sweeping motion stimuli which is not present in adulthood. Further, female mice display a robust enhancement of approach towards visual motion over all other groups tested, yet they are the least aggressive in response to live prey. Thus, our work overall revealed that innate approach towards visual motion is robustly dissociated from predatory aggression in female versus male mice specifically during adolescence. This underscores the different natural behavioral goals and physiological states that uniquely apply to female versus male adolescent animals, and reveals that approach towards visual motion is a key sensory-motor process selectively augmented during female adolescence."

The upside-down jelly-fish , sleeps [,], and this behavior is controlled by radially-spaced marginal ganglia. After defining a sleep-wake threshold, we compared gene expression profiles of ganglia from animals sleep-deprived for two nights and found differential expression in many sleep-related genes including GABAergic, melatonergic, and cholinergic receptors. We focused on a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit-like (Chrnal-E), based on its differential expression, and selected animals for a second round of RNAseq that included both light-based and mechanically-based sleep-deprivation. Combining datasets revealed a short list of differentially expressed genes, of which , is the most recognizable and well-supported, so we investigated its potential role in sleep regulation. First, we found that chemical cholinergic neuromodulators positively regulate pacemaker activity. Then, we showed by , hybridization that , is expressed primarily within the ganglia, and that the area of expression expands after sleep deprivation. Next, we developed RNAi for use in , and determined that Chrnal-E promotes wakefulness. Finally, we sampled circadian timepoints in the field and found in control conditions, , has lowest expression late at night, but in sleep deprived animals, , peaks at this time, supporting a link to wakefulness. Our finding that , sleep is regulated by the cholinergic system underscores that mechanisms of sleep conservation are deeply conserved in animal evolution."

Context-dependent Rhythmicity in Chimpanzee Displays,"Bas,Veerle,Judith,Michelle,Bas,Veerle,Judith,Michelle,Bas,Veerle,Judith,Michelle","Rhythm is an important component of human language and music production. Rhythms like isochrony (intervals spaced equally in time), are also present in vocalisations of certain non-human species, including several birds and mammals. This study aimed to identify rhythmic patterns with music-based methods within display behaviour of chimpanzees (,), humans’ closest living relatives. Behavioural observations were conducted on individuals from two zoo-housed colonies. We found isochronous rhythms in vocal (e.g. pants, grunts and hoots), as well as in motoric (e.g. swaying and stomping) behavioural sequences. Among individuals, variation was found in the duration between onsets of behavioural elements, resulting in individual-specific tempi. Despite this variation in individual tempi, display sequences were consistently structured with stable, isochronous rhythms. Overall, directed displays, targeted at specific individuals, were less isochronous than undirected displays. The presence of rhythmic patterns across two independent colonies of chimpanzees, suggests that underlying mechanisms for rhythm production may be shared between humans and non-human primates. This shared mechanism indicates that the cognitive requirements for rhythm production potentially preceded human music and language evolution."

The nature of memory stored in the hippocampus and neocortex also differs, with the cortex shown to encode memories in more generalized forms. Although several brain regions are known to encode social information, the specific cortical regions and circuits involved in the consolidation of social memory and the nature of the information encoded in the cortex remain unclear. Using , Ca, imaging and optogenetic manipulations, we found that infralimbic (IL) neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens shell (IL,) neurons store consolidated social memory. Inactivating IL, neurons that responded to a familiar conspecific impaired the recognition of other familiar mice including littermates, demonstrating that these neuronal activities support social familiarity. Furthermore, inactivating hippocampal ventral CA1 neurons projecting to the IL disrupted the consolidation of memory for newly familiarized mice while sparing the recognition of littermates. These findings demonstrate the critical role of hippocampal-cortical interactions in the consolidation of social memory."

To sustain this complex system, dolphins rely on a rich vocal repertoire: clicks exclusively used for echolocation, burst-pulse sounds associated with emotions during social interactions, and whistles, including signature whistles that serve as individual-specific identifiers (names). 
How dolphins maintain their complex social structure based only on a limited repertoire of sounds remains elusive. Previous studies suggest that contextual information can be transferred by the modulation of the whistles.
Here, we investigated the whistle variability using a comprehensive computational approach, and studied the structure of the interactions between the whistle variants. Using a unique large dataset, acquired in a natural environment, we observed that signature whistles exhibit variations in their frequency contours. Unsupervised clustering revealed that signature whistles could be classified into sub-categories (signature whistle variants). The existence of these categories, and their independence on the emitter dolphin, indicate that these variations are not random. Analysis of pairwise interactions between sub-categories revealed a clustered structure similar to that of their social hierarchy. Network analysis of this structure showed that whistle sub-categories had different functional roles: some acted as hubs, others as bridges, and certain were used for turn-taking between the main whistle categories. We also found that the dolphins emit signature whistles of their deceased mothers, a phenomenon only observed in human language."
What matters to a mouse? Effects of internal and external context on male vocal response to female squeaks,"Lauren  Riley,Laura  M,Lauren  Riley,Laura  M,Lauren  Riley,Laura  M","Individuals plastically adjust their signaling behavior depending on the social context of an interaction, but which aspects of context elicit the strongest responses from individuals is often difficult to determine. To explore how internal and external contextual factors influence the communication of house mice, we employed a split-cage playback assay to assess how dominant and subordinate male mice differed in their ultrasonic vocalization (USV) production in response to playback of broadband vocalizations (BBVs, or squeaks). We assessed how individuals altered their behavior depending on the odors present during the assay: either just female odors (Fem condition) or female odors in addition to the odors of potential competitors, other males (Fem+Male condition). Using this repeated-measures design, we evaluated two distinct cohorts of individuals: males exposed to the odor of familiar competitors in the Fem+Male condition (Familiar odor cohort), and males exposed to the odor of unfamiliar competitors in the Fem+Male condition (Unfamiliar odor cohort). While dominants and subordinates did not differ in their baseline vocal production or response to squeaks, all groups reduced their vocal production in response to BBV playback, and the addition of unfamiliar male odor prompted mice to decrease their baseline levels of calling and decrease the complexity of their vocal repertoire. Importantly, this effect of additional male odor was not present when individuals were presented with male odor familiar to them. These findings suggest that mice alter their vocal behavior during courtship interactions in response to cues that indicate the presence of potential competitors, and this response is modulated by the familiarity of these competitor cues."
The temporal copulatory patterns of female rat sexual behavior,"John C.,Roy,Eelke MS,John C.,Roy,Eelke MS,John C.,Roy,Eelke MS","Female sexual behavior is a naturally rewarding activity that plays an important role in reproduction and species survival. For female rats, regulating the timing of sexual interactions is essential for optimizing mating satisfaction and enhancing the physiological conditions needed for successful fertilization. So far, traditional research on female sexual behavior has relied on a limited set of behavioral parameters, which has certain shortcomings. To address this, our study aimed to develop a more detailed behavioral framework for assessing temporal copulatory patterns in female rats. We compared fully receptive females and less-receptive females, while also investigating the effects of (R)-(+)-8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist known for its inhibitory impact on female sexual behavior. Additionally, we examined how sexual experience and pacing conditions influence these copulatory patterns. Our results revealed that female rats engage in structured patterns of sexual bouts and time-outs, with higher receptivity leading to more sexual bouts and shorter time-outs. This suggests that sexual bouts can be viewed as an indicator of copulatory intensity, while time-outs reflect motivation to continue mating. Sexual experience did not enhance sexual performance but did result in females receiving more copulatory events from males. Lastly, we found that the conditions under which mating occurs (paced vs. non-paced) may not significantly impact copulatory behavior in fully-receptive females but could be more relevant for less-receptive females. Despite this, paced mating conditions remain preferable for studying female sexual behavior."
Better and faster collective decisions by larger fish shoals in the wild,"Korbinian,David,Yunus,Carla,Alejandro,Jesus Emmanuel,Stefan,Max,Pawel,Lenin,Jens,Korbinian,David,Yunus,Carla,Alejandro,Jesus Emmanuel,Stefan,Max,Pawel,Lenin,Jens,Korbinian,David,Yunus,Carla,Alejandro,Jesus Emmanuel,Stefan,Max,Pawel,Lenin,Jens","Studies on collective cognition have provided many examples of decision-making benefits in terms of animals sharing information about predators, prey or resources in their environment. It has been shown how the efficient spread of adaptive information within groups can pro-vide benefits which increase with group size. Little is known, however, to which extent groups also amplify maladaptive information such as false alarms and whether such costs reduce or even nullify the above benefits. Here, we investigated fish shoals in the wild that responded collectively with escape dives when attacked by birds. We analysed the response of shoals in reaction to hard-to-detect bird attacks and similar but harmless flybys as a func-tion of shoal size. With increasing shoal size fish increasingly detected predator attacks (true positives) while their false alarms remained constant. Therefore, larger shoals became better at correctly classifying potentially dangerous stimuli rather than becoming more sensitive to all stimuli potentially related to attacks. In addition, decision time decreased with increasing shoal size. Larger shoals were thus able to mitigate two major trade-offs inherent in solitary decision making: the trade-off between true and false positives and the trade-off between speed and accuracy. We report performance increases at shoal sizes of tens of thousands of fish and pose challenges for the modelling of the underlying mechanisms."
Fine Social Discrimination of Siblings in Mice: Implications for Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease,"Lola MP,Sébastien,Camille,Claire,Laure,Lola MP,Sébastien,Camille,Claire,Laure,Lola MP,Sébastien,Camille,Claire,Laure","The ability to distinguish between individuals is crucial for social species and supports behaviors like reproduction, hierarchy formation, and cooperation. In rodents, social discrimination relies on memory and recognition of individual-specific cues, known as individual signatures. While olfactory signals are central, other sensory cues - such as auditory, visual, and tactile inputs - also play a role. However, little research has explored the fine discrimination of individuals with overlapping cues, such as siblings or cohabitating mice. This study investigates whether mice can discriminate between two closely related individuals: siblings from the same litter and cage. We tested the hypothesis that it would be more challenging for mice to distinguish between siblings than between unrelated mice due to shared cues. Moreover, social cognitive impairments are common in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), where difficulties in recognizing faces and voices progressively disrupt social interactions in patients. Using a mouse model of AD (Tg2576), known for the progressive onset of cognitive deficits, we assessed whether the ability to discriminate between siblings is preserved in pre-symptomatic animals. Thus, we first demonstrated that male and female C57BL6/J mice can discriminate siblings, regardless of sex. Then, we revealed that pre-symptomatic 3-month-old Tg2576 mice exhibit impairments in subtle social memory, while their general social memory remains unaffected. Hence, we demonstrate that the inability to perform fine social discrimination is an early cognitive impairment that arises before other well-documented memory abnormalities in this AD mouse model."
Bumblebees increase their learning flight altitude in dense environments,"Annkathrin,Mathieu,Olivier J. N.,Martin,Annkathrin,Mathieu,Olivier J. N.,Martin,Annkathrin,Mathieu,Olivier J. N.,Martin","Bumblebees rely on visual memories acquired during the first outbound flights to relocate their nest. While these learning flights have been extensively studied in sparse environments with few objects, little is known about how bees adapt their flight in more dense, cluttered, settings that better mimic their natural habitats. Here we investigated how environmental complexity influences the first outbound flights of bumblebees. In a large arena we tracked the bees' 3D positions to examine the flight patterns, body orientations, and nest fixations across environmental conditions characterised by different  object constellations around the nest entrance.
In cluttered environments, bees prioritised altitude gain over horizontal distance, suggesting a strategy to overcome obstacles and visual clutter. Body orientation patterns became more diverse in dense environments, indicating a balance between nest-oriented learning and obstacle avoidance. Notably, bees consistently preferred to fixate the location of the nest entrance from elevated positions above the dense environment across all conditions. Our results reveal significant changes in 3D flight structure, body orientations, and nest fixation behaviours as object density increases. This highlights the importance of considering three-dimensional space and environmental complexity in understanding insect navigation."
Reasoning by exclusion in food-caching Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius),"Isobelle,Michael,Susan,Nicola  S.,Isobelle,Michael,Susan,Nicola  S.,Isobelle,Michael,Susan,Nicola  S.","Two related methods have been widely used to test animals' capacity to reason by exclusion: Call's (2004) 2-cups task, where subjects choose between two cups in which one reward was hidden and the empty cup is revealed; and Premack & Premack's task (1994) where one reward goes in each of the two cups and one reward is removed. In both cases, success is identifying the cup with the reward. It has been suggested that among corvids, the demands associated with caching may foster exclusion abilities by reinforcing the experience of relevant contraries (e.g., empty vs. full), or by supporting domain general capacities that support caching and exclusion inferences. However, Shaw et al. (2013) found that Eurasian jays, proficient cachers, failed a version of Call's 2-cups task. To further test the caching hypothesis, we amended the procedure using invisible displacement to hide rewards, removing aspects of Shaw et al.'s procedure that may have masked competence of Eurasian jays. We tested seven Eurasian jays, who showed spontaneous success on both Call's 1-reward/show-empty (80% correct) and Premack and Premack's 2-reward/remove-1 (85% correct). These results align with the hypothesis that corvids' exclusion reasoning is related to caching behaviour."
Projections from thalamic nucleus reuniens to hippocampal CA1 area participate in context fear extinction by affecting extinction-induced molecular remodeling of excitatory synapses,"Magdalena,Narges,Anna,Monika,Roberto,Malgorzata  Alicja,Ahmad,Kasia,Magdalena,Narges,Anna,Monika,Roberto,Malgorzata  Alicja,Ahmad,Kasia,Magdalena,Narges,Anna,Monika,Roberto,Malgorzata  Alicja,Ahmad,Kasia","The ability to extinguish contextual fear in a changing environment is crucial for animal survival. Recent data support the role of the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) and its projections to the dorsal hippocampal CA1 area (RE→dCA1) in this process. However, it remains poorly understood how RE impacts dCA1 neurons during contextual fear extinction (CFE). Here, we reveal that the RE→dCA1 pathway contributes to extinction of contextual fear by affecting CFE-induced molecular remodeling of excitatory synapses. Anatomical tracing and chemogenetic manipulation in mice demonstrate that RE neurons form synapses and regulate synaptic transmission in the stratum oriens (SO) and lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) of the dCA1 area, but not in the stratum radiatum (SR). We also observe CFE-specific structural changes of excitatory synapses and expression of the synaptic scaffold protein, PSD-95, in both strata innervated by RE, but not in SR. Interestingly, only the changes in SLM are specific for the dendrites innervated by RE. To further support the role of the RE→dCA1 projection in CFE, we demonstrate that brief chemogenetic inhibition of the RE→dCA1 pathway during a CFE session persistently impairs the formation of CFE memory and CFE-induced changes of PSD-95 levels in SLM. Thus, our data indicate that RE participates in CFE by regulating CFE-induced molecular remodeling of dCA1 synapses."

The consonance of chords: The effect of subsemitone changes to each of the notes in a trichord on its perceived consonance,"J.M.,J.M.,M. J.,J.M.,J.M.,M. J.,J.M.,J.M.,M. J.","Consonance plays a key role in how listeners experience music, but the factors influencing consonance perception remain a topic of discussion, for instance regarding the role of the familiarity of note combinations. Previous empirical studies of consonance have used common, familiar chords, making it harder to separate the effect of acoustic features from familiarity. Here we explored consonance perception in an unfamiliar, non-standardly tuned 0-5-10 trichord. A test was conducted in which 100 musicians and 100 nonmusicians compared the consonance of an original, non-standard, 0-5-10 chord and an adapted version, in which the lowest, middle or upper note was raised or lowered with 25 or 50 cents. According to a model based on continuous acoustic features, any adaptation to a 0-5-10 chord should yield a comparable decrease in consonance. We indeed found a general consonance decrease, but this was stronger for adaptations enlarging the distance between the lowest and the upper note, i.e. lowering the lowest or raising the highest note, than for other adaptations. These results deviate from the model’s predictions and from patterns observed in standard, more familiar chords. Future research should examine the generalizability of these findings to other chords than the 0-5-10 trichord."
Analysis of coordinated group behavior based on role-sharing: Practical application from an experimental task to a 3-on-3 basketball game as a pilot study,"Jun,Masatoshi,Keisuke,Jun,Masatoshi,Keisuke,Jun,Masatoshi,Keisuke","A human group shares a common goal and distributes roles to implement activities that are difficult to accomplish alone and higher performance than an individual. In such coordination, nonverbal behavior among three or more members makes it difficult to explain the mechanism because of complex and dynamic interactions. In cognitive science, a crucial role is indicated, which intervenes moderately with others and adjusts the whole balance without interrupting their main smooth interactions, using an experimental task. It suggests that the third role and related playing supports to coordination. This is similar to off-ball movements in team sports, which are not involved directly with the ball and are focused on mainly in sports science because common statistical data do not reflect. A new perspective for discussing coordination has arisen because existing theories, such as synchronization, cannot explain the mentioned role; however, there is room for its usefulness. Therefore, this study applied the experimental findings to the sports field. We designed a 3-on-3 basketball game in which the relevant offensive role is key and introduced it to the practice of the university team as a pilot study. Participants repeatedly engaged in the mini-game, and the playing on the offensive team was compared before and after receiving tips on this role. Consequently, in the bins of the relatively large distance between the participant required in this role and each defensive player, the frequencies after the tips were significantly higher, and the winning rate on the offensive team improved temporarily. It suggests that the spacing skill, which indicates a reasonable distance for intervening with the other offensive players, emerged. This study may provide findings that satisfy usefulness and ecological validity, and make an educational contribution about giving the tips of off-ball movements."
Illumination mediates a switch in both active sensing and control in weakly electric fish,"Huanying,Yu,Debojyoti,Noah J.,Huanying,Yu,Debojyoti,Noah J.,Huanying,Yu,Debojyoti,Noah J.","Animals integrate multiple sensory inputs to explore environments and execute locomotor behaviors. To carry out these behaviors, the nervous system internally reweights controller gains, putting more emphasis on those with the least uncertainty, e.g. in a Bayesian framework. Meanwhile, as sensory uncertainty increases, animals produce more vigorous active sensing movements. To better understand the link between these two complementary processes—multisensory reweighting and active sensing—we studied how the weakly electric glass knifefish , alters its movement dynamics under parametric manipulations of illumination. We hypothesized a concomitant switch in both active sensing (an overt behavior) and multisensory reweighting (an internal control computation). To test this, we varied illumination levels from 0.1 to 210 lx as fish tracked a moving refuge. We discovered that in a neighborhood of a critical threshold (on the order of 1 to 10 lx), small increases in illumination led to dramatic changes in both active sensing and multisensory control, specifically in 1) steep reductions in fish head and tail movements and 2) decreased refuge tracking phase lag. Outside of this threshold, large changes in illumination only caused mild changes in behavior. A control-theoretic model that dynamically modulates the weights of vision and electrosense due to illumination changes explains the changes in closed-loop behavior in our experiments. Our findings enhance our understanding of active sensing, multisensory reweighting, and locomotor control."
Contextual enhancement on binge-like overconsumption of palatable sugar in mice,"Hiroshi,Yasunobu,Hiroshi,Yasunobu,Hiroshi,Yasunobu","Binge eating disorder is an eating disorder characterized by the excessive intake of food within a short period, often beyond physiological needs. Studies using animal models have shown that binge eating animals consume food in quantities that surpass physiological necessity, and that the neural mechanisms underlying this behavior overlap with those involved in habit formation. Habitual behaviors are thought to be automatic responses acquired through extended behavioral training and are dependent on the context in which they were learned. Therefore, this study hypothesized that binge eating has a context-dependent component. We investigated whether the excessive palatable sugar intake observed in an animal model of binge eating is triggered by an associated context as a learned behavior. To test this, mice were trained to develop binge-like sugar consumption in a specific context. During the test phase, we reduced the animals’ hedonic needs for sugar solution by providing a two-hour satiety period. Sugar solution was then presented in both the training context and a novel context. The results showed that in the training context, the mice continued to consume sugar solution at levels similar to those observed at the onset of the satiation. In contrast, this context-induced sugar consumption was not observed in the novel context. These findings suggest that, like habitual behaviors, binge eating is induced under in the context-dependent manner and insensitive to the consequence of the behavior."

"Vocal communication is seasonal in social groups of wild, free-living house mice","N,C,B,AK,N,C,B,AK,N,C,B,AK","House mice (,) are among the most widely studied laboratory models of mammalian social behavior, yet we know relatively little about the ecology of their behaviors in natural environments. Here, we address this gap using radiotelemetry to track social interactions in a population of wild mice over 10 years, from 2013 to 2023, and interpret these interactions in the context of passive acoustic monitoring data collected from August 2022 until November 2023. Using deep convolutional neural networks, we identify 1.3 million individual vocalizations and align them in time with continuously collected telemetry data recording social interactions between individually identifiable mice. We find that vocalization is seasonal and correlated with long-term dynamics in features of social groups. In addition, we find that vocalization is closely associated in time with entrances to and exits from those groups, occurs most often in the presence of pups, and is correlated with how much time pairs of mice spend together. This work identifies seasonal patterns in the vocalizations of wild mice and lays a foundation to investigate the social role of acoustic communication in wild populations of a classic laboratory model organism."

Landing on a swinging perch: peach-faced lovebirds prefer extremes,"Partha S,Andrew A.,Partha S,Andrew A.,Partha S,Andrew A.","Birds frequently must land safely and accurately on moving branches or power lines, and seemingly accomplish such maneuvers with acrobatic precision. To examine how birds target and land successfully on moving supports, we investigated how peach-faced lovebirds (,) approach and land on a swinging perch. Lovebirds were trained to take off from a hand-held perch and fly ∼6 m to land on a servo-controlled swinging perch, driven at three sinusoidal frequencies, in a purpose-built flight corridor. Lovebird flight and landing kinematics were recorded using a motion capture system. A force-torque sensor mounted to the landing perch recorded the bird’s horizontal and vertical landing force and pitch torque. In support of our hypothesis for stable landings, lovebirds timed their landings in a majority of trials (51.3%), when the perch was approaching either extreme of its motion with its velocity nearing zero (27.5% in the same direction as the bird’s approach – SDs, and 23.8% in the opposite direction to the bird’s approach – ODs). As a result, lovebirds exhibited a robust bimodal strategy for timing their landing to the phase of the swinging perch. Less commonly, lovebirds landed when the perch was moving at high velocity either toward the bird’s approach (12.3%) or in the same direction as the bird’s approach (11.5%); with the remainder (21.9%) of trials distributed over a broad range of swing phases. Landing forces were greatest in the horizontal plane, with vertical forces more varied and of smaller magnitude across all landing conditions. This reflected the shallow flight trajectory (center of mass approach angle: −13.2 , 3.0o SEM relative to horizontal) that the lovebirds adopted to decelerate and land. Increased landing force correlated with greater landing speed of the bird relative to the perch (R2 = 0.4296, , 0.0001). The lovebirds initiated landing with a consistent body pitch angle (81.9 , 0.46o SEM relative to horizontal) across all landing conditions, using the horizontal perch reaction force to assist in braking when landing. Correspondingly, the landing angle of the feet relative to the perch support was 56.9 , 2.8o. Subsequent head-down body pitch rotation of the bird after landing was not well correlated and generally opposite to the initial direction and magnitude of landing pitch torque, which was generally negative due to foot rotation and ankle flexion at landing. Flexion of the birds’ hind limb joints (ankle: - 29.2 , 9.2o, knee: −13.6 , 7.4o, and hip: −4.0 , 3.4o at landing, combined with their horizontal approach trajectory, reduced the magnitude of landing torque by aligning the bird’s center of mass trajectory more closely to the landing perch (3.61 , 0.21 cm) than if they landed from above the perch. Landing pitch torque and body pitch rotation also increased uniformly in response to increased perch swing frequency. In contrast to landing forces, landing pitch torque was more varied across landing conditions, as well as in relation to the phase of landing. In general, higher landing force was encountered when the perch was moving towards the approaching bird. Our results indicate that lovebirds regulate their approach trajectory and velocity to time the phase of landing to a moving perch, providing insight for designing biologically-inspired unmanned aerial vehicles capable of landing on moving targets."
Visual-spatial dynamics drive adaptive social learning in immersive environments,"Charley M.,Dominik,Benjamin,Bjorn,Mark H,Ralf HJM,Charley M.,Dominik,Benjamin,Bjorn,Mark H,Ralf HJM,Charley M.,Dominik,Benjamin,Bjorn,Mark H,Ralf HJM","Human cognition is distinguished by our ability to adapt to different environments and circumstances. Yet the mechanisms driving adaptive behavior have predominantly been studied in separate asocial and social contexts, with an integrated framework remaining elusive. Here, we use a collective foraging task in a virtual Minecraft environment to integrate these two fields, by leveraging automated transcriptions of visual field data combined with high-resolution spatial trajectories. Our behavioral analyses capture both the structure and temporal dynamics of social interactions, which are then directly tested using computational models sequentially predicting each foraging decision. These results reveal that adaptation mechanisms of both asocial foraging and selective social learning are driven by individual foraging success (rather than social factors). Furthermore, it is the degree of adaptivity---of both asocial and social learning---that best predicts individual performance. These findings not only integrate theories across asocial and social domains, but also provide key insights into the adaptability of human decision-making in complex and dynamic social landscapes."

A sensory approach to turbidity: How sources and levels shape aquatic light environments and fish visual ecology,"Anna,Adelaide,Theresa,Cait,Anna,Adelaide,Theresa,Cait,Anna,Adelaide,Theresa,Cait","Turbidity is a ubiquitous source of sensory pollution that is likely to impact the appearance of the visual stimuli that animals rely on for survival and reproduction. Understanding how different turbidity sources impact the appearance of the ambient light environment is the foundational first step towards predicting whether and how animals will cope with the global increases in the severity and frequency of high turbidity events caused by anthropogenic disturbance. Here, we measured how four common turbidity sources (algae, bentonite, calcium carbonate, and kaolin), and variable turbidity levels, changed the appearance of the ambient light environment. We measured total number of photons (luminance), hue, chroma, and image contrast, and we evaluated the effect of each turbidity source and level on settling rate, pH, and KH. Both turbidity source and turbidity level impacted the appearance of the ambient light environment. With increasing turbidity level, calcium carbonate and kaolin increased luminance while algae decreased luminance, bentonite caused the greatest change in hue, and algae caused the greatest change in chroma. This demonstrates that the impacts of different turbidity sources on the ambient light environment are not uniform, giving a potential explanation for the discrepancies between studies on the effects of turbidity on fish behaviour. Consideration of the effect of specific turbidity sources on ambient light is crucial for the design of experiments that seek to investigate how changes in turbidity impact the perception of important visual information, which underpins the survival and reproductive success of aquatic organisms around the world."

When Rivals Are Absent: Male Aggression Towards Females in Bluefin Killifish,"Ratna,Rebecca C.,Ratna,Rebecca C.,Ratna,Rebecca C.","The process of obtaining mates, mating, and (potentially) caring for offspring is costly. While there are inherent costs to reproduction, behavioral interactions among individuals are often the primary drivers of reproductive costs. Males frequently compete for territories and females; females may compete for food or males; males often harass females. Here, we sought to determine whether reproductive costs were primarily due to male/male competition, female/female competition, or male/female interactions in the bluefin killifish. In this species, males guard small spawning territories where females visit them daily to spawn. To manipulate the potential for male and female competition and male/female interactions, we altered the sex ratio and density of each sex across four treatments (1 male: 1 female, 1 male : 3 females, 3 males: 1 female, 3 males: 3 females). Female mortality was higher than male mortality. Surprisingly, female mortality and male aggressive behaviors towards females (i.e., chases) were highest in treatments with a single male. Male-male aggression was present, but males often resolved these disputes via signaling by flaring their fins. There was little evidence for overt aggression among females. When males lack rivals, they turn their territorial defense towards females. These costs help explain why, in nature, females promptly leave male territories following spawning and join loose shoals with conspecific females and minnows."
" behavior, fitness, and lifespan, are modulated by AWB/ASH-dependent death perception","Mirella A.,Brian,Nicholas D.,Matthias C.,Mirella A.,Brian,Nicholas D.,Matthias C.,Mirella A.,Brian,Nicholas D.,Matthias C.","The ability of the nervous system to initiate intricate goal-directed behaviors in response to environmental stimuli is essential for metazoan survival. In this study, we demonstrate that the nematode , perceives and reacts to dead conspecifics. The exposure to , corpses as well as corpse lysates activates sensory neurons AWB and ASH, triggering a glutamate-and acetylcholine-dependent signaling cascade that regulates both immediate (aversion) and long-term (survival) responses to the presence of a death signature. We identify increased adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and cysteine concentrations as chemical fingerprints for the presence of metazoan corpses and show that death cue sensing by AWB and ASH leads to physiological changes which promote reproduction at the expense of lifespan. Our findings illuminate a novel signaling paradigm that allows organisms to detect and interpret the environmental enrichment of intracellular metabolites as a death cue."
Strength of low-frequency EEG phase entrainment to external stimuli is associated with fluctuations in the brain’s internal state,"Verónica,Alexandra,Sander,Verónica,Alexandra,Sander,Verónica,Alexandra,Sander","The brain attends to environmental rhythms by aligning the phase of internal oscillations. However, the factors underlying fluctuations in the strength of this phase entrainment remain largely unknown. In the present study we examined whether the strength of low-frequency EEG phase entrainment to rhythmic stimulus sequences varied with pupil size and posterior alpha-band power, thought to reflect arousal level and excitability of posterior cortical brain areas, respectively. We recorded pupil size and scalp EEG while participants carried out an intermodal selective attention task, in which they were instructed to attend to a rhythmic sequence of visual or auditory stimuli and ignore the other perceptual modality. As expected, intertrial phase coherence (ITC), a measure of entrainment strength, was larger for the task-relevant than for the task-irrelevant modality. Across the experiment, pupil size and posterior alpha power were strongly linked with each other. Interestingly, ITC tracked both variables: larger pupil size was associated with a selective increase in entrainment to the task-relevant stimulus sequence, whereas larger posterior alpha power was associated with a , in phase entrainment to both the task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimulus sequences. Exploratory analyses showed that a temporal relation between ITC and posterior alpha power emerged in the time periods around pupil maxima and pupil minima. These results indicate that endogenous sources contribute distinctly to the fluctuations of EEG phase entrainment."

Polarised Moonlight Guides Nocturnal Bull Ants Home,"Cody A,Ajay,Trevor,Ken,Cody A,Ajay,Trevor,Ken,Cody A,Ajay,Trevor,Ken","For the first time in any animal, we show that nocturnal bull ants use the exceedingly dim polarisation pattern produced by the moon for overnight navigation. The sun or moon can provide directional information via their position; however, they can often be obstructed by clouds, canopy or the horizon. Despite being hidden, these bodies can still provide compass information through the polarised light pattern they produce/reflect. Sunlight produces polarised light patterns across the overhead sky as it enters the atmosphere, and solar polarised light is a well-known compass cue for navigating animals. Moonlight produces an analogous pattern, albeit a million times dimmer than sunlight. Here we show evidence that polarised moonlight forms part of the celestial compass of navigating nocturnal ants. Nocturnal bull ants leave their nest at twilight and rely heavily on the overhead solar polarisation pattern to navigate. Yet many foragers return home overnight when the sun cannot guide them. We demonstrate that these bull ants use polarised moonlight to navigate home during the night, by rotating the overhead polarisation pattern above homing ants, who alter their headings in response. Furthermore, these ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar month, even under crescent moons, when polarised light levels are at their lowest. Finally, we show long-term incorporation of this moonlight pattern into the ants’ path integration system throughout the night for homing, as polarised sunlight is incorporated throughout the day."

We tested narrowband blue, green, and red spectra, three ratios of red and blue light, and a spectrum combining all three colors across a gradient of light intensity in microcosms. , was active and successfully attacked prey under all lighting conditions, with 70% of individuals engaging in predation during the observation period. The light spectrum significantly influenced all recorded behaviors, while light intensity had negligible effects. Narrowband spectra led to the highest attack probabilities, but the mixed blue-red spectrum with a higher proportion of red light yielded the highest prey capture rates. The spectrum with all three colors showed intermediate capture success. These trends were consistent regarding capture probability in more complex environments with cucumber plants, where thrips were exposed to 24-hour artificial light sequences before and during predator releases. However, thrips survival rates remained similar across all lighting treatments. Our results demonstrated that while lighting treatments affect predator behavior, , retains its ability to capture prey under various light conditions. This paves the way for developing lighting strategies that balance plant productivity with effective biological control in protected crop environments."

"Migration strategies of a high-latitude breeding songbird (,) revealed using multi-sensor geolocators and stable isotopes","Stephanie J,Johanna K,Mads,Benjamin M,Alan,David P L,Stephanie J,Johanna K,Mads,Benjamin M,Alan,David P L,Stephanie J,Johanna K,Mads,Benjamin M,Alan,David P L","Seasonal migration allows animals to use habitat where conditions are unfavorable for part of the year but may constrain breeding ranges due to the costs of longer migrations as ranges expand poleward. In species with large ranges, high latitude breeding populations may employ different migratory strategies allowing them to persist far from other core non-breeding areas. The myrtle warbler (,) has two disjunct non-breeding ranges in North and Central America–one along the Gulf Coast and the other on the Pacific. Previous work indirectly linked birds breeding in Alaska with the Pacific non-breeding area, suggesting that high latitude populations evolved a shorter migration route. We directly tested this hypothesis using geolocators measuring both light and atmospheric pressure to track Alaskan myrtle warbler migration in fine detail and inferred non-breeding areas using hydrogen isotopes for a larger sample of birds breeding in Alaska, British Columbia, and Alberta. We found, contrary to expectations, that all geolocator-tracked birds and most birds with stable isotope data migrated to the southeastern United States, while only a small subset of birds (∼5%) likely wintered on the Pacific Coast. We additionally demonstrate the advantages of pressure geolocation for characterizing migratory behavior at a fine scale."
A computational principle of habit formation,"Kaushik,Kaushik,Kaushik","Actions are influenced by multiple decision-making systems – including a goal-directed system that favors rewarded actions and a habit system that repeats past actions – but precisely when one system prevails is not known. We show that when competition between these systems is resolved by a winner-take-all mechanism, the precise condition for the emergence of habits can be cast in terms of the well-known probability matching principle. The theory embodies a trade-off in which exploitation, or overmatching, maximizes reward but strengthens habits, while paradoxically, exploration preserves goal-directed behavior by sacrificing rewards. This tradeoff can be averted if learning operates on abstract latent state representations whereby knowing the broader context allows for switching between two habits instead of avoiding one, thus maximizing rewards without forfeiting flexibility. The theory explains a range of animal behaviors as well as task-dependent effects of striatal manipulation, and suggests that neural mechanisms governing exploration implicitly control arbitration between decision-making systems."

Fentanyl reinforcement history has sex-specific effects on multi-step decision-making,"Eric,Yifeng,Laia,Andy,Cecelia,Yunru,Jennifer,Zachary,Albert,Nora,Patricia H.,Eric,Yifeng,Laia,Andy,Cecelia,Yunru,Jennifer,Zachary,Albert,Nora,Patricia H.,Eric,Yifeng,Laia,Andy,Cecelia,Yunru,Jennifer,Zachary,Albert,Nora,Patricia H.","It is commonly thought that drug addiction involves a transition to habitual control of action, where the choice to consume drugs becomes automatized and reflects a failure to deliberate over possible negative outcomes. Determining whether the pursuit of addictive drugs is habitual is hampered by a lack of behavior assessments suitable for use during a bout of drug seeking. Therefore, to understand how variable histories of drug reinforcement might affect goal-directed and habitual pursuit of drug rewards, we trained rats to perform a multi-step decision-making task to earn oral fentanyl or sucrose rewards following extensive training with either fentanyl or sucrose. Importantly, this task allowed for independent measurements of goal-directed and habitual choice characteristics during online pursuit of rewards, and habitual choice could further be categorized into perseverative and reward-guided components. Extensive fentanyl training led to a bias for reward-guided habitual choice specifically in females, and a relatively high degree of perseveration in both sexes. These behavioral changes after chronic fentanyl generalized across fentanyl and sucrose seeking. In contrast, during fentanyl sessions, females showed increased perseveration, and both sexes showed blunting of the gradual improvement in goal-directed choice. These results show that chronic drug reinforcement induced habits that generalized across seeking drug and non-drug rewards, and female rats were especially susceptible to habitual control induced by both chronic and acute drug reinforcement."

V.","Increasing dietary fat causes over-eating and weight gain in multiple animal species, suggesting that increases in dietary fat are sufficient to cause obesity. However, in such experiments high-fat diet is typically provided freely to animals, so it remains unclear how increasing dietary fat would impact body weight if the high-fat diet required more effort to obtain. Here, we hypothesized that unrestricted access is necessary for mice to overeat high-fat diets, and the corollary that requiring mice to perform small amounts of work to obtain high-fat diets would reduce food intake and weight gain in a high-fat diet model of obesity. To test this hypothesis, we utilized home-cage based feeding devices that either provided food freely or required mice to briefly poke their noses into a port – a simple action that is easy for them to do - to receive food. With both low-fat and high-fat diets, requiring mice to nose-poke just one time to access food strongly reduced food intake, and in the case of high-fat diet prevented the development of obesity. We conclude that unrestricted access to food promotes overeating in mice, and that making mice perform a simple action such as a nose-poke to access food reduces over-eating and weight gain. We posit that ubiquitous access to low-cost food is a critical contributor to the human obesity epidemic, and that changes in the availability of unhealthy food may be part of the solution for addressing the obesity epidemic."
Maximum vertical height during wing flapping of laying hens captured with a depth camera,"Tessa,Valentina,Junjie,Juan,Janice  M,Tessa,Valentina,Junjie,Juan,Janice  M,Tessa,Valentina,Junjie,Juan,Janice  M","Cage-free housing systems for laying hens, and their accompanying guidelines, legislation, and audits, are becoming more common around the world. Cage-free regulations often specify requirements for floor space and cage height, but the availability of three-dimensional space can vary depending on system configurations. Little research has looked at how much vertical space a hen occupies while flapping her wings, which is arguably her most space-intensive behavior. Therefore, the objective of this study was to use a depth sensing camera to measure the maximum vertical height hens reach when wing flapping without physical obstructions. Twenty-eight individually caged Hy-line W36 hens at 45 weeks of age were evaluated. A ceiling-mounted depth camera was centered above a test pen and calibrated prior to collecting data. During testing, one hen at a time was placed in the test pen and recorded flapping her wings. From depth footage, the minimum distance between pixels was obtained for each frame, and we computed the maximum vertical height reached by each hen. Results for vertical space used during a wing flapping event showed that hens reached a maximum height of 51.0 ± 4.7 cm. No physical measures correlated with maximum height obtained from the depth camera (P > 0.05). Hens in this study were from a single strain, were old enough to have keel damage, and were cage-reared and housed, preventing us from generalizing the results too far. However, depth cameras provide a useful approach to measure how much space laying hens of varying strains, ages, and rearing/housing methods need to perform dynamic behaviors."
"Reproductive experience drives changes in behavior and physiology in male California mice (,)","Maria E.,Priyanka,David,Erica R.,Heidi S.,Maria E.,Priyanka,David,Erica R.,Heidi S.,Maria E.,Priyanka,David,Erica R.,Heidi S.","Paternal experience improves memory and reduces anxiety-like behavior in males, but it is unclear whether these changes are due to mating, siring offspring, or caregiving behavior. Likewise, paternal males have larger testes, a measure of sperm production, but again, the effects of siring and caregiving experience are difficult to disentangle. We examined behavioral and physiological outcomes in three groups of male mice: 1) virgins, 2) males paired with sterile females (‘non-fathers’), and 3) experienced fathers (Experiment 1). Compared to virgins and non-fathers, experienced fathers exhibited increased recognition memory (novel object recognition) and decreased anxiety-like behavior (elevated plus maze). Virgin males, however, had smaller testes and fewer sperm compared to non-fathers. We then compared the same traits in three additional groups of male mice: 1) non-fathers, 2) non-fathers with experience caring for unrelated pups (‘pup-sensitized non-fathers’), and 3) first-time fathers, to determine whether the behavioral and physiological observations in Experiment 1 were due to siring offspring or caregiving, and how rapidly these changes occur (Experiment 2). Recognition memory and anxiety-like behavior did not differ among these three groups, suggesting that caring for a single litter does not recapitulate the behavioral changes observed in experienced fathers (Experiment 1). Despite equal mating opportunity, we observed larger testes in first-time fathers compared to non-fathers, suggesting that investment in sperm production may be more plastic than behavioral changes. Finally, we compared pup interactions in pup-sensitized non-fathers and first-time fathers. While pup-sensitized non-fathers were slower to approach pups than first-time fathers, they spent more time grooming pups, whereas first-time fathers invested more time in nest building, suggesting different caregiving behaviors in pup-sensitized males and biological fathers. Taken together, our study revealed that mating, siring, and caregiving experience contributes to changes in memory, anxiety-like behavior, and reproductive investment in males of a biparental species."
Willingness to wait covaries with endogenous variation in cortisol,"Evgeniya,Jeffrey C,Evgeniya,Jeffrey C,Evgeniya,Jeffrey C","Stress is a normal part of our everyday lives. It alerts us to changes in our environment working as an early warning system. However, when stress is prolonged, it can become harmful. The deleterious effects of stress on brain function are well established: chronic stress significantly impairs cognitive function reducing our ability to solve problems and to regulate behavior and, therefore, may lead to more challenges that can further exacerbate stress. An important class of decisions that may be made under stress includes those between rewards delivered immediately vs. those delivered in the future. Not considering or devaluing future outcomes (delay discounting) can result in adverse outcomes such as not buying health insurance, gambling or drug use. To date, however, little is known about how chronic stress influences economic decisions that differ in the time of outcome delivery. A handful of studies suggest that increased stress may lead to more impulsive choices in subjects of average socioeconomic status and stress levels. Here, we addressed this gap by using a longitudinal design to determine whether chronic stress measures (via questionnaires, saliva and hair samples) are associated with the economic choices under different time scales within subject (N = 34). We found that the degree to which people think it is worth waiting, i.e. individual's discount factor, over seconds, but not over days, varied reliably with endogenous stress. These results are imperative to studying stress in a variety of contexts: e.g., the variation in consumer's impulse purchases could be attributed to the variation in individual stress responses to the environment, even in healthy adults."
Essential tremor with tau pathology features seeds indistinguishable in conformation from Alzheimer's disease and primary age-related tauopathy,"Nil,Jaime,Charles L,Yogesh,Stephanie,Phyllis L,Elan D,Marc I,Nil,Jaime,Charles L,Yogesh,Stephanie,Phyllis L,Elan D,Marc I,Nil,Jaime,Charles L,Yogesh,Stephanie,Phyllis L,Elan D,Marc I","Neurodegenerative tauopathies are characterized by the deposition of distinct fibrillar tau assemblies whose rigid core structures correlate with defined neuropathological phenotypes. Essential tremor (ET) is a progressive neurological disease associated with cognitive impairment and, in some cases, tau accumulation. Consequently, we explored the tau assembly conformation in ET patients with tau pathology using cytometry-based tau biosensor assays. These assays quantify tau prion seeding activity present in brain homogenates based on conversion of intracellular tau-fluorescent protein fusions from a soluble to an aggregated state. Prions exhibit seeding barriers, whereby a specific assembly structure cannot serve as a template for a native monomer if the amino acids are not compatible. We recently exploited the tau prion species barrier to define tauopathies by systematically substituting alanine (Ala) in the tau monomer and measuring its incorporation into seeded aggregates within biosensor cells. The Ala scan precisely classified the conformation of tau seeds from diverse tauopathies. We next studied 18 ET patient brains with tau pathology. Only one case had concurrent high amyloid beta plaque pathology consistent with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We detected robust tau seeding activity in 9 (50%) of the patients. This predominantly localized to the temporal pole and temporal cortex. We examined 8 ET cases with the Ala scan and determined that the amino acid requirements for tau monomer incorporation into aggregates seeded from these ET brain homogenates were identical to those of AD and primary age-related tauopathy (PART), and completely distinct from other tauopathies such as corticobasal degeneration, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Based on these studies, tau assembly cores in a pathologically confined subset of ET cases with high tau pathology are identical to AD and PART. This could facilitate more precise diagnosis and therapy for ET patients with cognitive impairment."
A natural history of networks: Modeling higher-order interactions in geohistorical data,"Alexis,Anton,Magnus,Daniel,Christopher,Martin,Alexis,Anton,Magnus,Daniel,Christopher,Martin,Alexis,Anton,Magnus,Daniel,Christopher,Martin","Paleobiologists are increasingly employing network-based methods to analyze the complex data retrieved from geohistorical records, including stratigraphic sections, sediments, and fossil collections. However, the lack of a common framework for designing, performing, evaluating, and communicating these studies, leads to issues of  reproducibility and communicability. The high-dimensional geohistorical data also raises questions about the limitations of standard network approaches, which assume independent interactions between pairs of components. Higher-order network models better suited for the complex relational structure of the geohistorical data provide an opportunity to overcome these challenges. These models can represent temporal and spatial constraints inherent to the biosedimentary record and describe higher-order interactions, capturing more accurate biogeographical, biostratigraphic, and macroevolutionary patterns. Here we describe how to use the Map Equation framework for designing higher-order network models of geohistorical data, address some practical decisions involved in modeling complex dependencies, and discuss critical methodological and conceptual issues that currently make it difficult to compare results across studies in the growing body of network-based paleobiology research. We illustrate different higher-order network representations and models, including multilayers, hypergraphs, and varying Markov times models, using case studies on gradient analysis, bioregionalization, and macroevolution, and delineate future research directions for current challenges in the emerging field of network paleobiology."
Lack of evidence for the contribution of cone photoreceptors to human melatonin suppression and alerting response to light at night,"Fatemeh,Rafael,Faady,Christian,Manuel,Oliver,Christian,Fatemeh,Rafael,Faady,Christian,Manuel,Oliver,Christian,Fatemeh,Rafael,Faady,Christian,Manuel,Oliver,Christian","Light exposure at night can suppress melatonin production and increase alertness, primarily through the action of melanopsin-containing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). This study investigated whether cone photoreceptors also influence melatonin suppression and subjective alertness using non-visual metameric light emitted from a display. Forty-eight participants with normal trichromatic vision were exposed to three lighting conditions: a baseline (9 lxmEDI), constant background (149 lxmEDI), and cone-modulated flickering light targeting different cone combinations and post-receptoral channels (149 lxmEDI) for 2 hours after their habitual bedtime. Salivary melatonin levels and subjective alertness were measured throughout a 9-h protocol. Bayesian analysis showed that cone-modulated flickering light did not significantly affect melatonin suppression or alertness, providing evidence against the hypothesis that cone photoreceptors contribute to these non-visual effects of light. In conclusion, our results suggest cone photoreceptors do not play a measurable role in light's effects on melatonin suppression and subjective alertness at night."
Suppression of epithelial proliferation and tumorigenesis by immunoglobulin A,"Gregory P.,Gabriella L.,Marwa,Christopher,Izabela,Guo,Nicole L.,Dayu,Begum,Caroline E.,Tiago B.R.,Sergei,Bernardo S.,Beth M.,Gabriel D.,Daniel,Gregory P.,Gabriella L.,Marwa,Christopher,Izabela,Guo,Nicole L.,Dayu,Begum,Caroline E.,Tiago B.R.,Sergei,Bernardo S.,Beth M.,Gabriel D.,Daniel,Gregory P.,Gabriella L.,Marwa,Christopher,Izabela,Guo,Nicole L.,Dayu,Begum,Caroline E.,Tiago B.R.,Sergei,Bernardo S.,Beth M.,Gabriel D.,Daniel","Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the most abundant antibody isotype produced across mammals and plays a specialized role in mucosal homeostasis(1). Constantly secreted into the lumen of the intestine, IgA binds commensal microbiota to regulate their colonization and function(2,3) with unclear implications for health. IgA deficiency is common in humans but is difficult to study due to its complex aetiology and comorbidities(4-8). Using genetically and environmentally controlled mice, here we show that IgA-deficient animals have increased susceptibility to endogenous colorectal tumours. Cellular and molecular analyses revealed that, in the absence of IgA, colonic epithelial cells induce antibacterial factors and accelerate cell cycling in response to the microbiota. Oral treatment with IgA was sufficient to both reduce steady-state proliferation and protect mice from tumours, but this function was due to antibody structure rather than binding specificity. In both organoid and monolayer culture systems, IgA directly suppressed epithelial growth. Co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and a targeted CRISPR screen identified DMBT1 as an IgA-binding epithelial surface protein required for IgA-mediated suppression of proliferation. Together, IgA and DMBT1 regulate Notch signalling and tune the normal cycling of absorptive colonocyte progenitors. In mice, deleting the transmembrane and cytoplasmic signalling portions of DMBT1 or blocking Notch signalling was sufficient to reverse both the increased proliferation and tumour susceptibility of IgA knockouts. These experiments establish a homeostatic function for IgA in tempering physiological epithelial responses to microbiota to maintain mucosal health."
Cardiolipin Inhibits the Noncanonical Inflammasome by Preventing LPS Binding to Caspase 4/11 to Mitigate Endotoxemia in Vivo,"Malvina,Mercedes,Sabrina Sofia,Jakub,Melan,Jing Rong,Emmanuelle,Joanna,Monalisa,Kirsten M.,Jared R.,Masahiro,Si Ming,Petr,Pablo,Kate,Malvina,Mercedes,Sabrina Sofia,Jakub,Melan,Jing Rong,Emmanuelle,Joanna,Monalisa,Kirsten M.,Jared R.,Masahiro,Si Ming,Petr,Pablo,Kate,Malvina,Mercedes,Sabrina Sofia,Jakub,Melan,Jing Rong,Emmanuelle,Joanna,Monalisa,Kirsten M.,Jared R.,Masahiro,Si Ming,Petr,Pablo,Kate","In Gram-negative bacterial sepsis, excessive caspase 4/11 activation in response to circulating bacterial lipid LPS (endotoxemia) can cause organ damage and mortality. Current inhibitors of caspase 4/11 also block caspase 1 activity and are therefore not appealing clinical candidates for treating Gram-negative sepsis. Here, we identify double-unsaturated 18:2 cardiolipin as a selective inhibitor of caspase 4/11-dependent inflammatory cytokine secretion and pyroptosis, without affecting caspase-1 responses. Cardiolipin targets the CARD domain of caspase 4/11, impeding its interaction with LPS to restrain caspase 4/11 activation, thereby suppressing endotoxemia-induced systemic inflammation in vivo. Thus, we present cardiolipin as a promising candidate for preventing endotoxemia-induced sequelae in sepsis while preserving caspase-1-driven anti-microbial immune responses. By identifying cardiolipin as a specific caspase 4/11 inhibitor, we provide an urgently-needed tool for studying caspase 4/11 functions in inflammatory pathways, and open the way to studies of noncanonical inflammasome regulation by endogenous cardiolipin."
Massive presence of the invasive Polydora websteri (Polychaeta: Spionidae) in the North Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean Sea),"Marco,Cristina,Marco,Cristina,Marco,Cristina","In recent decades, the Mediterranean Sea has experienced a marked escalation in the introduction of non-native and invasive marine species. The global expansion of aquaculture, coupled with the increased movement of commercial species, has raised concerns about the potential for introducing parasites into new environments, posing a growing threat to marine ecosystems. Polydora websteri is a shell boring polydorin worm that induces the formation of mud-filled blisters within the shells of molluscs. The annelid is considered indigenous to the Asian coasts and has been documented in various locations across the globe. In the present work, we report a massive presence of P. websteri in several sites of the North Adriatic costline and we provide some diagnostic features that are useful to identify the species. Polydora websteri can be distinguished of a lateral flange on chaetiger 5. Moreover the palps are characterized by continuous black lines along the margins of the ciliated groove. The combined findings of this study provide compelling evidence that P. websteri is expanding its range within the Mediterranean coast. Given the potential for severe ecological and economic impacts associated with this invasive polychaete, this study serves as an urgent call to action for increased monitoring of P. websteri in both farmed and wild Pacific oysters in the Mediterranean Sea. Identification key of Mediterranean Polydora is provided."
Revisiting sour rot of grapevine through disease-associated microbiomes: a tripartite co-infection?,"Hévin,Matthieu,Patrik,Bart,Katia,Jean-Luc,Valérie,Hévin,Matthieu,Patrik,Bart,Katia,Jean-Luc,Valérie,Hévin,Matthieu,Patrik,Bart,Katia,Jean-Luc,Valérie","Sour rot in grapevines is thought to result from berry infection by yeasts, acetic acid bacteria and vinegar flies. Our results confirm previous studies having shown that sour rot supersedes grey mould when both diseases are present in a vineyard, but also indicate that the two diseases can cohabit at an advanced stage of grape decay. To better characterize the role of each of the actors involved in sour rot expression, we conducted experiments involving the isolation of 1593 fungi and bacteria to understand the composition and dynamics of the microbiomes associated with healthy berries, diseased berries and insect vectors. As some grape clusters became symptomatic for sour rot in the absence of acetic acid bacteria, the latter do not always appear necessary for disease expression. The yeast genus , is reported here for the first time to be able to initiate sour rot in grapes, similar to other yeast genera. By allowing or denying the access of insect vectors to intact or artificially wounded grapes, we demonstrate that vinegar flies accelerate disease expression but only when berries are previously injured. Furthermore, the yeast communities identified on native and introduced vinegar flies (,) are very similar and yeast-dominated. This confirms the key role of both introduced and endemic vinegar flies in the transmission of sour rot fungi. However, berry skin wounds, induced by heavy rainfall leading to high water uptake and rapid berry swelling, appear to be the main factor in disease expression."

This study aimed to characterize the mortality and pathological findings of free-ranging beavers in California and, based on these results, establish the potential threats to freshwater ecosystems. This study included eighteen beavers submitted for postmortem examination between 2008 and 2024 at the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory, UC Davis. Gross and microscopic examination, bacteriological, parasitological, immunohistochemical, and molecular techniques were used as tools to diagnose the cause of death/reason for euthanasia and comorbidities in the beavers. Encephalitis caused by the larva migrans of , spp. was the most prevalent (9/18) cause of mortality/reason for euthanasia followed by bacterial infections in 6 individuals. In these 6 animals, bacterial bronchopneumonia was diagnosed in two (, and a mix of gram-negative and -positive bacterial infection) and , encephalitis, bacterial myofascitis (, and ,), bacterial encephalitis (,), and tularemia (,) were diagnosed in one beaver each. Three animals died or were euthanized due to non-infectious causes including motor vehicle trauma, squamous cell carcinoma, and capture cardiomyopathy. Endoparasitism was the main comorbidity including granulomatous hepatitis by a suspected capillarid species, cerebral toxoplasmosis, Giardia infection, gastric nematodiasis, and cecal trematodiasis. In California, beavers are exposed to various pathogens that represent threats to humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. Since the interspecies transmission of these pathogens occurs in rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds, we suggest that studying beaver health can reflect freshwater ecosystem health. This study also indicates that the translocation of beavers into new areas without consideration and/or mitigation represents a potential risk for pathogen introduction."

Comprehensive identification of plasma membrane repair proteins revealed spatiotemporal cellular responses to plasma membrane damage,"Yuta,Keiko,Yuta,Keiko,Yuta,Keiko","Damage to the plasma membrane (PM) is common in all types of cells. PM repair processes, including exocytosis and endocytosis, are not mutually exclusive; rather, they collaborate to repair the wound. However, the temporal coordination between the repair processes remains poorly understood. Here, by comprehensively identifying PM repair proteins, we resolved the temporal PM repair processes at the damage site in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Of the 80 repair proteins identified, 72 proteins were previously unreported repair protein candidates. We showed that polarity establishment, polarized exocytosis, and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) occur in a specific temporal order at the damage site. Furthermore, we showed that polarized exocytosis and CME are coupled at the damage site, delivering PM repair proteins with transmembrane domains between the growing bud site and the damage site. This study provides insights into the temporal dynamics of coordinated cellular response to PM damage."
Intra-manchette transport employs both microtubule and actin tracks,"Jo,Laura,Tereza,Albert J.R.,Tzviya,Jo,Laura,Tereza,Albert J.R.,Tzviya,Jo,Laura,Tereza,Albert J.R.,Tzviya","The manchette is a transient microtubule based structure that plays a vital role in nuclear shaping during spermiogenesis. It comprises thousands of microtubules (MTs) that build a scaffold around the distal half of the nucleus. The manchette distributes proteins and vesicles during spermiogenesis in a process called intra-manchette transport (IMT). The current hypothesis is that IMT shares many similarities with intra-flagellar transport (IFT) and utilizes both MTs and filamentous actin (F-actin). However, IMT is still poorly understood as direct visualization of IMT complexes is missing, and the presence of F-actin has not been experimentally shown. Here, we use proteomics and cryogenic-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to identify and visualize IMT components. We find that F-actin is an integral part of the manchette with two different spatial organizations, namely bundles and single filaments, providing tracks for transport as well as having structural and mechanical roles. We further uncover that IMT on MTs is mediated by two distinct transport machineries: dynein mediated transport of soluble cargo and dynein independent transport for vesicles. Our results provide new insights into the manchette's function as a transport scaffold, highlighting its significance for the polarization of spermatids during spermiogenesis."
A lipid signature of BAK-driven apoptotic pore formation,"Rachel T,Matthew E,Agnes W,Justin P,Etsuko,Vinod K,David P,Dmitri,Ruth M,Rachel T,Matthew E,Agnes W,Justin P,Etsuko,Vinod K,David P,Dmitri,Ruth M,Rachel T,Matthew E,Agnes W,Justin P,Etsuko,Vinod K,David P,Dmitri,Ruth M","Apoptotic cell death is regulated by the BCL-2 protein family, with clusters of BAK or BAX homodimers driving pore formation in the mitochondrial outer membrane via a poorly understood process. There is growing evidence that, in addition to BAK and BAX, lipids play an important role in pore formation. Towards a better understanding of the lipidic drivers of  apoptotic pore formation in isolated mitochondria, two complementary approaches were taken. Firstly, the lipids released during BAK-mediated pore formation were measured with targeted lipidomics, revealing enrichment of long chain polyunsaturated lysophospholipids (LPLs) in the released fraction. In contrast, the BAK protein was not released suggesting that BAK and LPLs locate to distinct microdomains. Secondly, added cholesterol not only prevented pore formation but prevented the clustering of BAK homodimers. Our data lead us to a model in which BAK clustering triggers formation of a separate microdomain rich in LPLs that can progress to lipid shedding and the opening of a lipid-lined pore. Pore stabilisation and growth may be due to BAK dimers then moving to the pore edge. Our BAK-lipid microdomain model supports the heterogeneity of BAK assemblies, and the observed lipid-release signature gives new insight into the genesis of the apoptotic pore."
Real-time genomic characterization of pediatric acute leukemia using adaptive sampling,"Julie,Kofi,John,Lori,Charles,Nickhill,Thomas B.,Jeremy R.,Julie,Kofi,John,Lori,Charles,Nickhill,Thomas B.,Jeremy R.,Julie,Kofi,John,Lori,Charles,Nickhill,Thomas B.,Jeremy R.","Effective treatment of pediatric acute leukemia is dependent on accurate genomic classification, typically derived from a combination of multiple time-consuming and costly techniques such as flow cytometry, fluorescence , hybridization (FISH), karyotype analysis, targeted PCR, and microarrays (,; ,; ,). We investigated the feasibility of a comprehensive single-assay classification approach using long-read sequencing, with real-time genome target enrichment, to classify chromosomal abnormalities and structural variants characteristic of acute leukemia. We performed whole genome sequencing on DNA from diagnostic peripheral blood or bone marrow for 54 pediatric acute leukemia cases with diverse genomic subtypes. We demonstrated the characterization of known, clinically relevant karyotype abnormalities and structural variants concordant with standard-of-care clinical testing. Subtype-defining genomic alterations were identified in all cases following a maximum of forty-eight hours of sequencing. In 18 cases, we performed real-time analysis – concurrent with sequencing – and identified the driving alteration in as little as fifteen minutes (for karyotype) or up to six hours (for complex structural variants). Whole genome nanopore sequencing with adaptive sampling has the potential to provide detailed genomic classification of acute leukemia specimens with reduced cost and turnaround time compared to the current standard of care."

Thirteen snakes were affected; seven of these had been introduced from other Brazilian sites years earlier, the others had been bred in house but were not offspring of knowingly affected animals. The breeding regime allowed contact between all female and male animals over the years. The cutaneous lesions were first observed over eight years ago, with additional cases detected during the three following years, but no new cases in the last five years. Two affected animals were subjected to a post mortem examination and were found to suffer from peliosis hepatis as one of the additional pathological changes. BIBD was confirmed in five of the eight examined animals, by histology, immunohistology for reptarenavirus nucleoprotein, and multiplex RT-PCR targeting the reptarenavirus S segment. Reptarenavirus infection was also detected in cells in the cutaneous neoplastic processes. PCRs for , and , as well as bacterial DNA in general, performed on a pool of six skin lesions, yielded negative results, ruling out ongoing bacterial infection, like bacillary angiomatosis in humans, of the lesions. The results hint towards an association of reptarenavirus infection and BIBD with neoplastic processes which is worth further investigations."
Building neurovascular tissue from autologous blood for modeling brain-activity,"Rhythm,Alka,Naresh Kumar,Sanhita,Jaimanti,Ramandeep Singh,Sanjay,Banumathy,Gyanranjan,Sourabha Kumar,Anuradha,Reena,Tulika,Sanjay,Rimesh,Arnab,Nabhyajit,Madhumita,Ritin,Ravi,Meenakshi,Sajid,Maryada,Rhythm,Alka,Naresh Kumar,Sanhita,Jaimanti,Ramandeep Singh,Sanjay,Banumathy,Gyanranjan,Sourabha Kumar,Anuradha,Reena,Tulika,Sanjay,Rimesh,Arnab,Nabhyajit,Madhumita,Ritin,Ravi,Meenakshi,Sajid,Maryada,Rhythm,Alka,Naresh Kumar,Sanhita,Jaimanti,Ramandeep Singh,Sanjay,Banumathy,Gyanranjan,Sourabha Kumar,Anuradha,Reena,Tulika,Sanjay,Rimesh,Arnab,Nabhyajit,Madhumita,Ritin,Ravi,Meenakshi,Sajid,Maryada","There are no faithful individualized stem cell-based bioengineered neuro-vascularized models that can recapitulate the physiological hemodynamic phenomenon of neuro-vascular coupling (NVC)- the principal behind BOLD (blood oxygen level- dependent) signal in functional neuroimaging, thereby dissuading the research in exploring the brain activity-based investigative studies in neurological/neurosensory diseases. This encouraged us to establish a preclinical  optoacoustic (Hb/dHb hemoglobin/deoxyhemoglobin) imaging-competent in vitro neuro-vascularized model by employing a novel cellular reprograming PITTRep (Plasma Induced Transcriptomics/ epi-Transcriptomics Reprograming) approach. The current reprograming approach is based on coaxing autologous blood components to ecto-mesodermal lineage intermediates that can subsequently self-pattern into neurovascular tissue by harnessing the hemorheological properties of RBCs. The nature of blood flow is non-Newtonian and is a function of RBC concentration /haematocrit when they flow through the regions of low shear rates as seen in cerebral microcirculation. The current reprograming approach is a modification of our previous cellular reprograming approach that employed a Newtonian plasma fluid. We tested a potential (yet completely unexplored) hypothesis of haemodynamic reprograming by leveraging the fluid mechanic feature of blood erythrocytes as seen in thrombus formation during cerebral ischemic stroke, that is characterized by physiologically intriguing yet clinically meaningful neurological recovery during an early time window. Intriguingly, post-stroke heightened neuroplasticity marked by dendrites, synapses, astrogliosis, microglia activation, and growth factor signaling is accompanied by adult neurogenesis, that is otherwise a non-resilient phenomenon.
The current study attempted to induce  a post stroke-like (adult) neurogenesis with functional synaptogenesis by instructing autologous blood components into thrombus formation by  incorporation of erythrocytes in varying concentrations. The induction of neuro-vascularized niches (NVNs) and functional neuro vascular coupling (NVC)  was characterized by confocal microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, proteomic profiling, and Hb/dHb spectra based optoacoustic imaging. The blood thrombus formation was checked by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), and switching of adult to embryonic hemoglobin was confirmed by hemoglobin typing. We also attempted to establish  patient-specific neuro-vascularized niches from autologous blood of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) patients. The individualized neovascularised tissues are intended to be employed for investigating deregulated synaptic plasticity/ long term potentiation underlying poor auditory comprehension outcomes in school going kids suffering from SNHL that greatly compromises their academic performance and socio-behavioural-cognitive development. The attendant multiomics of patient-specific NVNs may have potential implications in developing potential stem cell based therapies for neurosensory and cerebrovascular diseases."
Spatial and network principles behind neural generation of locomotion,"Salif,August,Grace,Roar Jakob,Silas,Madelaine,Guanghui,Rune W,Salif,August,Grace,Roar Jakob,Silas,Madelaine,Guanghui,Rune W,Salif,August,Grace,Roar Jakob,Silas,Madelaine,Guanghui,Rune W","Generation of locomotion is a fundamental function of the spinal cord, yet the underlying principles remain unclear. In particular, the relationship between neuronal cell types, networks and function has been difficult to establish. Here, we propose principles by which functions arise primarily from spatial features of the cord. First, we suggest that distinct cell types with dissimilar length of projection constitute an asymmetrical ""Mexican hat"" topology, i.e. local excitation and surrounding inhibition, along the rostro-caudal axis. Second, the transversal segregation of cell types conveniently allows synapses to form with appropriate targets. We demonstrate these principles in a model of the mouse spinal cord, where networks are constructed by probabilistic sampling of synaptic connections from cell-specific projection patterns, which are gleaned from literature. The cell-type distributions are derived from single-cell RNA sequencing combined with spatial transcriptomics. We find that essential aspects of locomotion are recapitulated and easily controlled, and several experimental observations can now be explained mechanistically. Further, two main features are predicted: propagating bumps of neural activity and asymmetric neuronal projections with local excitation and wider inhibition. Besides linking cell types, structure and function, our approach provides a unifying framework for understanding motor activity across limbed and undulatory species."
Ventral Striatum is Preferentially Correlated with the Salience Network Including Regions in Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex,"Heather L,Mark C,Randy L,Heather L,Mark C,Randy L,Heather L,Mark C,Randy L","The ventral striatum (VS) receives input from the cerebral cortex and is modulated by midbrain dopaminergic projections in support of processing reward and motivation. Here we explored the organization of cortical regions linked to the human VS using within-individual functional connectivity MRI in intensively scanned participants. In two initial participants (scanned 31 sessions each), seed regions in the VS were preferentially correlated with distributed cortical regions that are part of the Salience (SAL) network. The VS seed region recapitulated SAL network topography in each individual including anterior and posterior midline regions, anterior insula, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) - a topography that was distinct from a nearby striatal seed region. The region of DLPFC linked to the VS is positioned adjacent to regions associated with domain-flexible cognitive control. The full pattern was replicated in independent data from the same two individuals and generalized to 15 novel participants (scanned 8 or more sessions each). These results suggest that the VS forms a cortico-basal ganglia loop as part of the SAL network. The DLPFC is a neuromodulatory target to treat major depressive disorder.  The present results raise the possibility that the DLPFC may be an effective neuromodulatory target because of its preferential coupling to the VS and suggests a path toward further personalization."

The infant brain undergoes many changes throughout the first years of postnatal life, making tissue segmentation difficult for most existing algorithms. Here, we introduce a deep neural network BIBSNet (Baby and Infant Brain Segmentation Neural Network), an open-source, community-driven model that relies on data augmentation and a large sample size of manually annotated images  to facilitate the production of robust and generalizable brain segmentations. Experimental Design: Included in model training and testing were MR brain images on 84 participants with an age range of 0-8 months (median postmenstrual ages of 13.57 months). Using manually annotated real and synthetic segmentation images, the model was trained using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. Testing occurred on MRI data processed with the DCAN labs infant-ABCD-BIDS processing pipeline using segmentations produced from gold standard manual annotation, joint-label fusion (JLF), and BIBSNet to assess model performance. Principal Observations: Using group analyses, results suggest that cortical metrics produced using BIBSNet segmentations outperforms JLF  segmentations. Additionally, when analyzing individual differences, BIBSNet segmentations perform even better. Conclusions: BIBSNet segmentation shows marked improvement over JLF segmentations across all age groups analyzed. The BIBSNet model is 600x faster compared to JLF and can be easily included in other processing pipelines."
The PVD neuron has male-specific structure and mating function in ,"Yael,David  H,Menachem,Benjamin,Yael,David  H,Menachem,Benjamin,Yael,David  H,Menachem,Benjamin","Neurons display unique shapes and establish intricate networks, which may differ between sexes. In complex organisms, studying sex differences in structure and function of individual neurons is difficult. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodites and males present an exceptional model for studying neuronal morphogenesis in a simple, sexually-dimorphic system. We focus on the polymodal sensory bilateral neuron pair PVD, which forms a complex but stereotypic dendritic tree composed of multiple subunits that resemble candelabra. PVD is well studied in hermaphrodites, but not in males. We show here that during larval development, male PVDs extend a similar architecture to the hermaphrodite utilizing the sexually-shared Menorin patterning mechanism. In early adulthood, however, male PVD develops a unique extension into the copulatory tail structure. This sexually-dimorphic arborization is absent in mutant backgrounds which perturb the Menorin guidance complex. SAX-7/L1CAM, a hypodermal component of this complex, shows a male-specific expression pattern which precedes PVD extension, and its presence allows PVD to enter the tail rays. Further, our results reveal that genetically altered arborization or ablation of the PVD result in male mating behavioral defects, particularly as males turn around the hermaphrodite. These results uncover an adult-stage sexual dimorphism of dendritic branching and uncover a new function for PVD in male sexual behavior."
Calculating Muscular Driven Speed Estimates for ,"Adrian T.,Scott,Adrian T.,Scott,Adrian T.,Scott","Top speed estimates of extinct dinosaurs have been of long-standing interest to gain better understanding of the animals’ lifestyle and ecology. , top speeds have been examined using a wide range of methods that draw on more traditional biomechanical formulas, computer simulations, and allometric equations based on mass. However, these calculations may be made more precise using input from contemporary research on anatomy and biomechanics that account for mass allometry and scaling. This study builds on existing studies in anatomy, biomechanical data, and established equations for locomotion to calculate a muscular driven range of top speed for several (n=4) specimens that had sufficient data to undertake this work. When properly refined with additional data on muscle mass allometry and scaling, several adult specimens of , could confidently be placed in a range of top speed from 7.7 to 10.5 m/s, and possibly up to 10.7 m/s. Additionally, a younger specimen of , was analyzed and found to have a higher top speed than the adult , at 6.3 to 14.5 m/s. Although the estimated top speeds in this study are slower than some previous estimates, these results find some support for slow running gaits and reinforce interpretations of , as an active and effective apex predator. Future work can build upon this study by investigating how muscular driven top speeds may affect ontogenetic niche partitioning and prey species regularly targeted by adult ,."
A 20+ Ma old enamel proteome from Canada’s High Arctic reveals diversification of Rhinocerotidae in the middle Eocene-Oligocene,"Ryan S.,Meaghan,Alessio,Nicola S.,Danielle,Fazeelah,Ioannis,Jazmín,Shanlin,Abigail D.,Marc R.,Chloë,Marisa,Raffaele,Luca,Gabriele,Fernando,Eske,Kirsty E.H.,Jesper V.,Ross D.E.,Natalia,Sebastian,Enrico,Ryan S.,Meaghan,Alessio,Nicola S.,Danielle,Fazeelah,Ioannis,Jazmín,Shanlin,Abigail D.,Marc R.,Chloë,Marisa,Raffaele,Luca,Gabriele,Fernando,Eske,Kirsty E.H.,Jesper V.,Ross D.E.,Natalia,Sebastian,Enrico,Ryan S.,Meaghan,Alessio,Nicola S.,Danielle,Fazeelah,Ioannis,Jazmín,Shanlin,Abigail D.,Marc R.,Chloë,Marisa,Raffaele,Luca,Gabriele,Fernando,Eske,Kirsty E.H.,Jesper V.,Ross D.E.,Natalia,Sebastian,Enrico","In the past decade, ancient protein sequences have emerged as a valuable source of data for deep-time phylogenetic inference. Still, the recovery of protein sequences providing novel phylogenetic insights does not exceed 3.7 Ma (Pliocene). Here, we push this boundary back to 21-24 Ma (early Miocene), by retrieving enamel protein sequences of an early-diverging rhinocerotid (, sp. - CMNF-59632) from the Canadian High Arctic. We recover partial sequences of seven enamel proteins (AHSG, ALB, AMBN, AMELX, AMTN, ENAM, MMP20) and over 1000 peptide-spectrum matches, spanning over at least 251 amino acids. Authentic endogeneity of these sequences is supported by indicators of protein damage, including several spontaneous and irreversible post-translational modifications accumulated during prolonged diagenesis and reaching near-complete occupancy at many sites. Bayesian tip-dating, across 15 extant and extinct perissodactyl taxa, places the divergence time of CMNF-59632 in the middle Eocene-Oligocene, and identifies a later divergence time for Elasmotheriinae in the Oligocene. The finding weakens alternative models suggesting a deep basal split between Elasmotheriinae and Rhinocerotinae. This divergence time of CMNF-59632 coincides with a phase of high diversification of rhinocerotids, and supports a Eurasian origin of this clade in the late Eocene or Oligocene. The findings are consistent with previous hypotheses on the origin of the enigmatic fauna of the Haughton crater, which, in spite of their considerable degree of endemism, also display similarity to distant Eurasian faunas. Our findings demonstrate the potential of palaeoproteomics in obtaining phylogenetic information from a specimen that is ten times older than any sample from which endogenous DNA has been obtained."
Individual G-quadruplex targeting with ligand-functionalized CRISPR-Cas9 uncovers transcriptional-dependent functional responses,"Sabrina Pia,Enrico,Roxani,Silvia,An-Jie,Thomas E.,Ella,Ling Sum,Christopher R.,John S.,Marco,Sabrina Pia,Enrico,Roxani,Silvia,An-Jie,Thomas E.,Ella,Ling Sum,Christopher R.,John S.,Marco,Sabrina Pia,Enrico,Roxani,Silvia,An-Jie,Thomas E.,Ella,Ling Sum,Christopher R.,John S.,Marco","The development of selective ligands to target DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) has been pivotal in revealing their role in transcriptional regulation. However, most of the ligands described to date lack intra-G4 selectivity, severely limiting their potential for uncovering the biological function of individual G4s across the genome. To overcome these limitations, we developed ATENA (Approach to Target Exact Nucleic Acid alternative structures). ATENA relies on the chemical modification of established G4-ligands to enable their conjugation onto a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein (dCas9) using HaloTag, allowing for the targeting of individual G4s in living cells. We have systematically screened the length of the PEG-linkers connecting the G4-ligands to the HaloTag and sgRNA sequences to attain optimal G4 engagement both , and in cells. Using optimized conditions, we leveraged ATENA to demonstrate how the selective targeting of the well-studied G4 in the promoter of the oncogene , suppresses its transcription exclusively from the P1 promoter. We also show that positioning ligands in the proximity of regulatory elements suppresses , transcription in a G4-independent manner, highlighting the importance of appropriate design to measure genuine G4-mediated transcriptional changes. We also demonstrate that selective targeting of a G4 in the , promoter can either stimulate or repress its transcription depending on the type of G4-ligand used, indicating that functional responses associated with G4-stabilization can highly depend on the type of ligand used. We further harnessed ATENA to study transcriptional perturbation associated with cell-specific G4s, revealing that the functional responses associated with these structures are tightly linked with the expression levels of the targeted gene. Our study provides critical insights into G4-based therapeutic design, offering an innovative platform to investigate G4 biology with high precision."
DIO-SPOTlight Transgenic Mouse to Functionally Monitor Protein Synthesis Regulated by the Integrated Stress Response,"Matthew L,Zachary F,Callie B.,Timothy D,Nicole,Matthew L,Zachary F,Callie B.,Timothy D,Nicole,Matthew L,Zachary F,Callie B.,Timothy D,Nicole","The integrated stress response (ISR) is a core pathway for maintaining cellular proteostasis and a key regulator of translation in processes beyond the cellular response to stress. For example, the ISR regulates developmental axonogenesis, learning and memory, and synaptic plasticity in the brain. One barrier to uncovering ISR roles in health and disease is the challenge of monitoring its activity. The transient nature of regulatory phosphorylation events and lack of transgenic ISR reporter mouse lines make visually capturing the molecular hallmarks of ISR activation in specific cell types especially difficult. We recently developed the SPOTlight (Selective Phospho-eIF2alpha Open reading frame Tracking light) reporter, which uniquely provides a readout of the functional state of protein synthesis initiation dynamics that are regulated by the ISR. Here, we report the generation of a transgenic mouse line with Cre-dependent expression of SPOTlight. This resource enables selective visualization of ISR-regulated functional activity across genetically defined cell populations body-wide. Using a pan-neuronal Cre line (Nestin-Cre), we demonstrate the reporter's performance and applications for cell-specific discovery, live tissue assessments and quantitative comparisons across broad physical space. We also specifically investigated the extent to which the property of steady-state basal ISR activation, recently described in dorsal striatal cholinergic interneurons, extends to other classes of cholinergic neurons and provide a CNS-wide atlas of SPOTlight activity in these cells. The DIO-SPOTlight mouse enables a wide range of studies in all organ systems and functional monitoring opportunities not previously accessible."
Post-Eocene Rhinocerotid Dispersal via the North Atlantic,"Danielle,Natalia,Marisa,Mary R.,Danielle,Natalia,Marisa,Mary R.,Danielle,Natalia,Marisa,Mary R.","The North Atlantic Land Bridge (NALB), which connected Europe to North America, enabled high latitude dispersal, particularly during globally warm periods such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, a period of dramatic faunal reorganization. It has been generally accepted that the NALB was submerged by the early Eocene. Herein, we describe a new rhinocerotid species from the early Miocene of the Canadian High Arctic with proximity to the NALB and present a novel phylogenetic hypothesis for rhinocerotids. We model a high number of dispersals between Europe and North America, some of which occurred in the Oligo-Miocene, suggesting that the NALB may have been crossable for mammals millions of years longer than previously considered. Moreover, recent geological and palaeoclimatological evidence suggest that, until the Miocene, portions of the NALB may have been separated only by narrow and shallow waterways and, potentially, bridged by seasonal sea ice as early as the late Eocene, enabling rhinocerotid dispersal. We thus provide insight into the importance of the Arctic as a persistent connector of otherwise geographically disparate faunas that played a pivotal role in mammalian evolution."

Over time, declines in infectious disease continue but chronic and degenerative causes persist,, so we might expect under-5 deaths to be concentrated in the first month of life. However, little is known about the age-pattern of this transition in early mortality or its potential limits. Here we first describe the limit using detailed data on Denmark, Japan, France, and the USA— developed countries with low under-5 mortality. The limiting pattern of under-5 deaths concentrates in the first month, but is surprisingly dispersed over later ages: we call this the early rectangularization of mortality. Then we examine the progress towards this limit of 31 developing countries from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)—the region with the highest under-5 mortality,. In these countries, we find that early deaths have large age-heterogeneities; and that the age patterns of death is an important marker of progress in the mortality transition at early ages. But a negative association between national income and under-5 mortality levels, confirmed here, does not help explain reductions in child mortality during the transition."

Anisotropy of object nonrigidity: High-level perceptual consequences of cortical anisotropy,"Akihito,Qasim,Akihito,Qasim,Akihito,Qasim","We present a surprising anisotropy in perceived object nonrigidity, a complex, higher-level perceptual phenomenon, and explain it unexpectedly by the distribution of low- level neural properties in primary visual cortex. We examined the visual interpretation of two rigidly connected rotating circular rings. At speeds where observers predominantly perceived rigid rotation of the rings rotating horizontally, observers perceived only nonrigid wobbling when the image was rotated by 90 degrees. Additionally, vertically rotating rings appeared narrower and longer compared to their physically identical horizontally rotating counterparts. We show that these perceived shape changes can be decoded from V1 outputs by incorporating documented anisotropies in orientation selectivity. We then show that even when the shapes are matched, the increased nonrigidity persists in vertical rotations, suggesting that motion mechanisms also play a role. By incorporating cortical anisotropies into optic flow computations, we show that the kinematic gradients (Divergence, Curl, Deformation) for vertical rotations align more with physical nonrigidity, while those for horizontal rotations align closer to rigidity, indicating that cortical anisotropies contribute to the orientation dependence of the perception of nonrigidity. Our results reveal how high-level percepts are shaped by low-level anisotropies, which raises questions about their evolutionary significance, particularly regarding shape constancy and motion perception."

Acute and chronic pesticide exposure trigger fundamentally different molecular responses in bumble bee brains,"Alicja,Federico,Andres,Richard J,Yannick,Alicja,Federico,Andres,Richard J,Yannick,Alicja,Federico,Andres,Richard J,Yannick","Beneficial wild insects including pollinators encounter various pesticide exposure conditions, from brief high concentrations to continuous low-level exposure. To effectively assess the environmental risks of pesticides, it is critical to understand how different exposure patterns influence their effects. Unfortunately, this knowledge remains limited. To clarify whether different exposure schemes disrupt the physiology of pollinators in similar manners, we exposed bumble bees to acute and chronic treatments of three different pesticides: Acetamiprid, clothianidin, and sulfoxaflor. Gene expression profiling enabled us to compare the effects of these treatments on the brain in a high-resolution manner. There were two main surprises: First, acute and chronic exposure schemes affected largely non-overlapping sets of genes. Second, different pesticides under the same exposure scheme showed more comparable effects than the same pesticide under different exposure schemes. Acute exposure caused up-regulation of stress response mechanisms causing distinct regulatory changes, rather than amplifying the effects of prolonged low-dose exposure that affected predominantly immunity and energy metabolism. These findings show that the mode of exposure critically determines the effects of pesticides. Our results signal the need for safety testing practices to better consider mode-of-exposure dependent effects and suggest that transcriptomics can support such improvements."

However, the role of the hippocampus in HD-related learning and memory deficits remains unclear. Objective: This study investigates the association between mHTT aggregation and neuropathology in the striatum and hippocampus of two HD mouse models. Methods: We performed a comparative analysis of neuropathology between zQ175 and in-house generated Q175DN mice, focusing on HTT aggregation, neuronal and glial pathology, chaperone expression, and synaptic density in both brain regions. Results: Q175DN mice exhibited increased mHTT aggregation in both the striatum and hippocampus compared to zQ175. Striatal neurons showed greater vulnerability to mHTT accumulation than hippocampal neurons in Q175DN, despite high mHTT levels in both regions. Interestingly, the Q175DN hippocampus displayed increased synaptic density, reduced Iba1+ microglia density, and elevated HSF1 levels in specific hippocampal subregions compared to zQ175 and neuropathology did not correlate with HTT aggregation. Conclusions: Q175DN mice are instrumental in elucidating the varying susceptibilities of striatal and other neuronal types to mHTT toxicity. The high spare capacity of the HD hippocampus suggests that cognitive deficits in HD may stem from striatal dysfunction or other brain regions involved in cognition, rather than from hippocampal degeneration."
Increased listening effort and cochlear neural degeneration underlie behavioral deficits in speech perception in noise in normal hearing middle-aged adults.,"Maggie E,Leslie,Jacie R,Jennifer,Kimberly,Victoria,Olivia,Claire,Jyotishka,Bharath,Aravindakshan,Maggie E,Leslie,Jacie R,Jennifer,Kimberly,Victoria,Olivia,Claire,Jyotishka,Bharath,Aravindakshan,Maggie E,Leslie,Jacie R,Jennifer,Kimberly,Victoria,Olivia,Claire,Jyotishka,Bharath,Aravindakshan","Middle-age is a critical period of rapid changes in brain function that presents an opportunity for early diagnostics and intervention for neurodegenerative conditions later in life. Hearing loss is one such early indicator linked to many comorbidities later in life. However, current clinical tests fail to capture hearing difficulties for ~10% of middle-aged adults seeking help at hearing clinics. Cochlear neural degeneration (CND) could play a role in these hearing deficits, but our current understanding is limited by the lack of objective diagnostics and uncertainty regarding its perceptual consequences. Here, using a cross-species approach, we measured envelope following responses (EFRs) - neural ensemble responses to sound originating from the peripheral auditory pathway - in young and middle-aged adults with normal audiometric thresholds, and compared these responses to young and middle-aged Mongolian gerbils, where CND was histologically confirmed. We observed near identical changes in EFRs across species that were associated with CND. Perceptual effects measured as behavioral readouts showed deficits in the most challenging listening conditions and were associated with CND. Additionally, pupil-indexed listening effort increased even at moderate task difficulties where behavioral outcomes were matched. Our results reveal perceptual deficits in middle-aged adults driven by CND and increases in listening effort, which may result in increased listening fatigue and conversational disengagement."
Representations of the intrinsic value of information in mouse orbitofrontal cortex,"Jennifer J,Ryan P,Christian David,Ethan S,LF,Kanaka,Richard,Jennifer J,Ryan P,Christian David,Ethan S,LF,Kanaka,Richard,Jennifer J,Ryan P,Christian David,Ethan S,LF,Kanaka,Richard","Animals are motivated to seek information that does not influence reward outcomes, suggesting that information has intrinsic value. We have developed an odor-based information seeking task that reveals that mice choose to receive information even though it does not alter the reward outcome. Moreover, mice are willing to pay for information by sacrificing water reward, suggesting that information is of intrinsic value to a mouse. We used a microendoscope to reveal neural activity in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) while mice learned the information seeking task.  We observed the emergence of distinct populations of neurons responsive to odors predictive of information and odors predictive of water reward. A latent variable model recapitulated these different representations in the low-dimensional dynamics of OFC neuronal population activity. These data suggest that mice have evolved separate pathways to represent the intrinsic value of information and the extrinsic value of water reward. Thus, the desire to acquire knowledge is observed in mice, and the value of this information is represented in the OFC.

Spatial organization of supercoil dynamics during DNA replication,"Yoshiharu,Soya,Ryu-Suke,Jiying,Shuichi,Satoshi,Toru,Yoshiharu,Soya,Ryu-Suke,Jiying,Shuichi,Satoshi,Toru,Yoshiharu,Soya,Ryu-Suke,Jiying,Shuichi,Satoshi,Toru","Progression of DNA replication inevitably generates helical tension and resulting super-helical structures, or supercoils, that originate from the double helix of DNA. As DNA polymerases progress, negative supercoils accumulate in the wake of the replication fork, thereby impeding fork progression unless the supercoils are resolved topologically. Using super-resolution microscopy combined with spatial distribution analysis, here we describe that SMC5/6-mediated confinement of negative supercoils lies at the basis of releasing them by topoisomerase Top2A. Along with DNA replication, SMC5/6 progressively associates with chromatin and locally increases the density of supercoil clusters behind the fork, allowing Top2A to efficiently target and release the accumulated supercoils. These processes are essential to complete DNA replication prior to mitosis and therefore to ensure genome stability. Remarkably, we found that HeLa cells over-accumulate poorly confined negative supercoils beyond the processing capacity of cellular SMC5/6, which may exemplify the condition associated with genome instability of cancer cells."

In vitro inhibition of the CFTR ion channel in the cervix thickens cervical mucus,"Rachel J,Mackenzie,Matthew,Rachelle,Shan,Kristi,Shuhap,Chris,Leo,Rachel J,Mackenzie,Matthew,Rachelle,Shan,Kristi,Shuhap,Chris,Leo,Rachel J,Mackenzie,Matthew,Rachelle,Shan,Kristi,Shuhap,Chris,Leo","Study question: Does the inhibition of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) alter cervical mucus produced by endocervical cells in vitro?
Summary answer: Inhibition of CFTR dehydrates and thickens in vitro endocervical secretions. 
What is known already: Cervical mucus changes throughout the menstrual cycle in response to hormonal fluctuations, helping to regulate fertility and access of pathogens to the reproductive tract. CFTR is an anion channel that plays a critical role in mediating epithelial mucus secretions. 
Study design, size, duration:  In vitro experiments conducted with control and experimental arms.
Participants/materials, setting, methods: Primary endocervical cells obtained from rhesus macaques Macaca mulatta were treated with vehicle controls or CFTR inhibitor Inh-172. Hydration and viscosity of secreted mucus was measured through air surface liquid and particle tracking microrheology. 
Main results and the role of chance: Endocervical cells treated with CFTR inhibitor Inh-172 demonstrated dehydrated, thicker mucus secretions compared to control (p<.01).  
Limitations, reasons for caution: In vitro models do not fully recapitulate cellular mucus secretions. 
Wider implications of the findings: Cervical mucus plays an important role in fertility regulation. Our studies suggest that CFTR may be an important mediator of those changes and provide experimental evidence for the infertility phenotype seen in women with cystic fibrosis. Additionally, assays used in these studies are useful endpoints for studying cervical mucus regulation in vitro."

Beta-hairpin Mechanism of Autoinhibition and Activation in the Kinesin-2 Family,"Stephanie,Katerina,Aakash G,Stephanie D,Anthony J,Stephanie,Katerina,Aakash G,Stephanie D,Anthony J,Stephanie,Katerina,Aakash G,Stephanie D,Anthony J","Members of the kinesin-2 family coordinate with other motors to power diverse physiological processes, but the structural mechanisms regulating kinesin-2 activity have been unknown. Distinctively, kinesin-2s canonically function as heterotrimers of two different motor subunits (e.g. Kif3A and Kif3B) and Kap3, but the role of heterotrimerization has yet to fully emerge. Here, we combine structural, cell biological, and single-molecule approaches to dissect kinesin-2 regulation as a heterodimer, heterotrimer, and quaternary complex with a cargo adaptor (APC). We identify a conserved motif in the tail of kinesin-2s (the beta-hairpin motif) that controls kinesin-2 motility by sequestering the motor domains away from their microtubule track, using striking molecular mimicry. Our data reveal how Kap3 binds via a multipartite interface with Kif3A and Kif3B, and – rather than activating motility directly – provides a platform on which cargo adaptors can engage and occlude the beta-hairpin motif. Together, these data articulate a structural framework for kinesin-2 activation, coordination with dynein, and adaptation for different biological functions."

A third kind of episodic memory: Context familiarity is distinct from item familiarity and recollection,"Richard J,Evan,Randal,Jesse,Daniel L,Jahdiel,Richard J,Evan,Randal,Jesse,Daniel L,Jahdiel,Richard J,Evan,Randal,Jesse,Daniel L,Jahdiel","Episodic memory is accounted for with two processes: familiarity when generally recognizing an item and recollection when retrieving the full contextual details bound with the item. Paradoxically, people sometimes report contextual information as familiar but without recollecting details, which is not easily accounted for by existing theories. We tested a combination of item recognition confidence and source memory, focusing upon item-only hits with source unknown (item familiarity), low-confidence hits with correct source memory (context familiarity), and high-confidence hits with correct source memory (recollection).  Results across multiple within-subjects (trial-wise) and between subjects (individual variability) levels indicated these were behaviorally and physiologically distinct. Behaviorally, a crossover interaction was evident in response times, with context familiarity being slower than each condition during item recognition, but faster during source memory. Electrophysiologically, a Condition x Time x Location triple dissociation was evident in event-related potentials (ERPs), which was then independently replicated among different multiple datasets. Context familiarity exhibited an independent negative central effect from 800-1200 ms, differentiated from positive ERPs for item-familiarity (400 to 600 ms) and recollection (600 to 900 ms). These three conditions thus reflect mutually exclusive, fundamentally different processes of episodic memory. Context familiarity is a third distinct process of episodic memory."
Post-retrieval noradrenergic activation impairs subsequent memory depending on cortico-hippocampal reactivation,"Hendrik,Gregor,Anthony D,Lars,Hendrik,Gregor,Anthony D,Lars,Hendrik,Gregor,Anthony D,Lars","When retrieved, seemingly stable memories can become sensitive to modification through significant events, such as acute stress. While memory dynamics after retrieval have profound implications, for instance, in eyewitness testimony or aberrant memory in mental disorders, the mechanisms underlying these dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we show in healthy humans that increases in noradrenaline after memory retrieval impairs subsequent remembering, depending on hippocampal and cortical reactivation during retrieval. In a three-day fMRI study, we measured brain activity during initial encoding (Day 1), 24h-delayed memory cueing accompanied by administration of placebo, hydrocortisone, or the α2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (Day 2), and final recall, 24h later (Day 3). While post-retrieval hydrocortisone did not affect subsequent memory (i.e., final recall), the impairing effect of yohimbine on final recall depended on the strength of hippocampal reactivation and category-level reinstatement in ventral temporal cortex during Day 2 retrieval. Notably, the effect of yohimbine on subsequent memory was contingent specifically on the neural reactivation during retrieval. While patterns from online reactivation were also reinstated in the post-retrieval rest-period, this offline reinstatement did not interact with the pharmacological manipulation. Additionally, the original memory trace from encoding was not significantly reactivated during retrieval and not reinstated offline during rest, further supporting the critical dependency of post-retrieval manipulations on the neural signal emerging during retrieval-related reactivation. Our findings demonstrate that, depending on the neural reactivation of memories, noradrenergic arousal after retrieval can alter the future accessibility of consolidated memories."
Multiplexed single-cell imaging reveals diverging subpopulations with distinct senescence phenotypes during long-term senescence induction.,"Garrett A,Madeline V,Brian O'Callaghan,Jeremy E,Garrett A,Madeline V,Brian O'Callaghan,Jeremy E,Garrett A,Madeline V,Brian O'Callaghan,Jeremy E","Cellular senescence is a phenotypic state that contributes to the progression of age-related disease through secretion of pro-inflammatory factors known as the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Understanding the process by which healthy cells become senescent and develop SASP factors is critical for improving the identification of senescent cells and, ultimately, understanding tissue dysfunction. Here, we reveal how the duration of cellular stress modulates the SASP in distinct subpopulations of senescent cells. We used multiplex, single-cell imaging to build a proteomic map of senescence induction in human epithelial cells induced to senescence over the course of 31 days. We map how the expression of SASP proteins increases alongside other known senescence markers such as p53, p21, and p16INK4a. The aggregated population of cells responded to etoposide with an accumulation of stress response factors over the first 11 days, followed by a plateau in most proteins. At the single-cell level, however, we identified two distinct senescence cell populations, one defined primarily by larger nuclear area and the second by higher protein concentrations. Trajectory inference suggested that cells took one of two discrete molecular paths from unperturbed healthy cells, through a common transitional subpopulation, and ending at the discrete terminal senescence phenotypes. Our results underscore the importance of using single-cell proteomics to identify the mechanistic pathways governing the transition from senescence induction to a mature state of senescence characterized by the SASP."
Scale matters: Large language models with billions (rather than millions) of parameters better match neural representations of natural language,"Zhuoqiao,Haocheng,Zaid,Harshvardhan,David,Bobbi,Leonard,Werner,Sasha,Patricia,Daniel,Orrin,Adeen,Uri,Sam,Ariel,Zhuoqiao,Haocheng,Zaid,Harshvardhan,David,Bobbi,Leonard,Werner,Sasha,Patricia,Daniel,Orrin,Adeen,Uri,Sam,Ariel,Zhuoqiao,Haocheng,Zaid,Harshvardhan,David,Bobbi,Leonard,Werner,Sasha,Patricia,Daniel,Orrin,Adeen,Uri,Sam,Ariel","Recent research has used large language models (LLMs) to study the neural basis of naturalistic language processing in the human brain. LLMs have rapidly grown in complexity, leading to improved language processing capabilities. However, neuroscience researchers haven't kept up with the quick progress in LLM development. Here, we utilized several families of transformer-based LLMs to investigate the relationship between model size and their ability to capture linguistic information in the human brain. Crucially, a subset of LLMs were trained on a fixed training set, enabling us to dissociate model size from architecture and training set size. We used electrocorticography (ECoG) to measure neural activity in epilepsy patients while they listened to a 30-minute naturalistic audio story. We fit electrode-wise encoding models using contextual embeddings extracted from each hidden layer of the LLMs to predict word-level neural signals. In line with prior work, we found that larger LLMs better capture the structure of natural language and better predict neural activity. We also found a log-linear relationship where the encoding performance peaks in relatively earlier layers as model size increases. We also observed variations in the best-performing layer across different brain regions, corresponding to an organized language processing hierarchy."
"Glymphatic system health in early Alzheimer's disease and its relationship to sleep, cognition and CSF biomarkers.","Nicola Jane,Natalia,Oliver J,Ariane,Giovanni,Andrea,Julia,Mariateresa,Judith,Gonzalo,Esther,Sonia,Jerzy,Nicola Jane,Natalia,Oliver J,Ariane,Giovanni,Andrea,Julia,Mariateresa,Judith,Gonzalo,Esther,Sonia,Jerzy,Nicola Jane,Natalia,Oliver J,Ariane,Giovanni,Andrea,Julia,Mariateresa,Judith,Gonzalo,Esther,Sonia,Jerzy","BACKGROUND: The glymphatic system is thought to facilitate waste clearance from the brain during sleep. Impairment in this system may underpin the elevated deposition of pathological proteins in neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Putative glymphatic system activity has been measured with contrast-enhanced, serial MRI, revealing slower clearance in people who are sleep deprived. It is important that these methods are used to understand changes to glymphatic function in people with early-stage AD.   
METHODS: Twenty-four individuals with mild cognitive impairment were recruited. N=20 had CSF biomarker data, with 16 meeting criteria for AD positivity (AD+). Participants underwent polysomnography, cognitive testing and serial T1 MRI with intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agent, diffusion tensor imaging along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS index), and core AD CSF biomarkers collection. Rate (over 24hrs) and efficiency (the amount of tracer cleared after 28hrs relative to uptake after 4hrs) of GCBA clearance were measured.   
RESULTS: Faster/more efficient GBCA clearance was associated with shorter sleep latency. In AD+ participants faster 24hr clearance of GBCA was associated with a lower ratio of AB1-42/AB1-40 in the CSF. In addition, better clearance efficiency was associated with greater levels of AB-40, lower levels of AB1-42, and a smaller ratio of AB-142/AB1-40 in the CSF. Higher DTI-ALPS indicated better cognitive performance and, unexpectedly, higher tau levels. However, it was not associated with GCBA clearance.  
CONCLUSIONS: We show, for the first time in humans, that glymphatic system function is associated with AD-related changes to sleep, cognition and core AD biomarker concentrations in CSF. However, for AD biomaker concentrations, these relationships are not in the expected direction: higher concentrations and lower AB1-42/AB1-40 ratio were associated with faster or more efficient clearance of GCBA. We suggest that increased neurodegeneration in those with elevated levels of tau and AB1-40 may paradoxically increase glymphatic activity locally to brain regions with more atrophy relative to less, but not in a way that improves sleep or cognition. In fact, larger extracellular spaces may exacerbate the spread of tau via the glymphatic system and therefore accelerate the progression of AD."
General Framework for Tracking Neural Activity Over Long-Term Extracellular Recordings,"Fernando Julian,Hernan Gonzalo,Fernando Julian,Hernan Gonzalo,Fernando Julian,Hernan Gonzalo","The recent advances in the chronic implantation of electrodes have allowed the collection of extracellular activity from neurons over long periods of time. To fully take advantage of these recordings, it is necessary to track single neurons continuously, particularly when their associated waveform changes with time. Multiple spike sorting algorithms can track drifting neurons but they do not perform well in conditions like a temporary increase in the noise level, sparsely firing neurons, and changes in the number of detectable neurons. In this work, we present Spikes_Link, a general framework to track neurons under these conditions. Spikes_Link can be implemented with different spike sorting algorithms, allowing the experimenter to use the algorithm best fitted to their recording setup. The main idea behind Spikes_Link is the blockwise analysis of the recording using overlapping sets of spikes to equally represent all the putative neurons being tracked on a given block. This way, we can link classes with clusters obtained in a new block based on an overlapping metric. Moreover, the algorithm can fix temporary sorting errors (splits and merges). We compared an implementation of Spikes_Link with other algorithms using long-term simulations and obtained superior performance in all the metrics. In general, the Spikes_Link framework could be used for other clustering problems with concept drift and class imbalance."
Suspended and sinking particle-associated microbiomes exhibit distinct lifestyles in the Elbe estuary,"Sven P.,Jason N.,Hans-Joachim,Shinichi,Vanessa,Wolfgang R.,Hans-Peter,Sven P.,Jason N.,Hans-Joachim,Shinichi,Vanessa,Wolfgang R.,Hans-Peter,Sven P.,Jason N.,Hans-Joachim,Shinichi,Vanessa,Wolfgang R.,Hans-Peter","Estuaries are important components of the global carbon cycle; exchanging carbon between aquatic, atmospheric, and terrestrial environments, representing important loci for blue carbon storage and greenhouse gas emissions. Estuarine particles are especially important due to their microbial transformation and vertical/horizontal transport. We used metagenomes and metatranscriptomes to assess changes in microbial community composition and functions across the Elbe estuary over one year, linking changes to dissolved and particulate organic matter. We will be the first to link microbial activity derived from molecular data to particulate and dissolved organic carbon characteristics. There were no microbial species responses to the measured physicochemical and dissolved/particulate organic matter parameters, however Weighted Correlation Network Analyses showed significant spatial microbiome differences linked to the estuarine salinity profile. Meanwhile, suspended and sinking particle fractions did not show any community wide differences, but individual gene analyses revealed clear microbial lifestyle differences. Sinking particle-associated transcripts highly expressed competition and stress-responses genes, while suspended particle-associated transcripts favoured energy acquisition and growth. Transcription patterns further indicate that suspended particles may represent a mitigating influence on methane release via methanotrophy, while both suspended and sinking particles produce methane through the same gene complex. This notion suggests that increased sinking particle abundance, such as under high turbidity conditions, leads to increased methane production. Our findings further imply that urban activities such as dredging may have a high impact on greenhouse gas emissions, and higher suspended-sinking particle ratios may alleviate aquatic-atmospheric methane exchanges. Future studies should explore in detail the underlying mechanisms and controlling variables, in particular when taking predicted global changes into account."
Perceptual Expertise and Attention: An Exploration using Deep Neural Networks,"Soukhin,George (Ron),Mingzhou,Soukhin,George (Ron),Mingzhou,Soukhin,George (Ron),Mingzhou","Perceptual expertise and attention are two important factors that enable superior object recognition and task performance. While expertise enhances knowledge and provides a holistic understanding of the environment, attention allows us to selectively focus on task-related information and suppress distraction. It has been suggested that attention operates differently in experts and in novices and much remains unknown. This study investigates the relationship between perceptual expertise and attention using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which are shown to be good models of primate visual pathways. Two CNN models were trained to become experts in either face or scene recognition, and the effect of attention on performance was evaluated in tasks involving complex stimuli, such as merged images containing superimposed faces and scenes. The goal was to explore how feature-based attention (FBA) influences recognition within and outside the models' domain of expertise. Results showed that each model performed better in its area of expertise and that FBA further enhanced task performance only within the domain of expertise, increasing performance by up to 35% in scene recognition and 15% in face recognition. However, attention had reduced or negative effects when applied outside the model's expertise domain. Neural unit-level analysis revealed that expertise leads to stronger neuronal tuning towards category-specific features and sharper tuning curves, reflected in greater representational dissimilarity between targets and distractors, which, according to the biased competition model of attention, reduces competition and leads to enhanced performance. These findings highlight the critical role of neural tuning at the single neuron level as well as at the level of multivariate neural representations in distinguishing the effects of attention in experts and in novices and demonstrate that CNNs can be used fruitfully as computational models for addressing neuroscience questions not practical with the empirical methods."

Hot periods are becoming increasingly common and their impacts on insect mortality have been well established, but they may have even greater impacts on insect fertility. In this study, we investigated the impacts of high temperatures on , fertility both within and across generations. Mosquitoes developing under elevated temperatures exhibited higher critical thermal maxima (CTmax) reflecting developmental acclimation, but their fertility declined with increasing developmental temperature. In females, elevated developmental temperatures decreased fecundity while in males it tended to decrease egg hatch proportions and the proportion of individuals producing viable offspring. Rearing both sexes at 35°C increased fecundity in the subsequent generation but effects of elevated temperatures persisted across gonotrophic cycles within the same generation. Moreover, exposure of adults to 35°C further decreased fertility beyond the effects of developmental temperature alone. These findings highlight sub-lethal impacts of elevated temperatures on , fertility and plastic responses to thermal stress within and across generations. This has significant implications for mosquito populations thriving in increasingly warmer environments."

Management and control of vector-borne disease require actual epidemiological data to better assess and anticipate the risk of (re)-emergence of tick-borne diseases in the region. To simplify and reduce the costs of such large-scale surveys, we implemented a high-throughput microfluidic real-time PCR system suitable for the screening of the main bacterial and parasitic genera involved in tick-borne disease and potentially circulating in the area. We used the new screening tool to perform an exploratory epidemiological study on 132 specimens of , and 446 of , collected in Guadeloupe and Martinique.

It is crucial, therefore, to get an in-depth understanding of current levels of such ES provision, and how they could be impacted by changed environments or management. However, applying existing models for water-related ES pose substantial challenges, which include the need for in-depth specialist hydrological knowledge, the requirement for numerous datasets and parameters that may not be consistently available, and high computational costs. Additionally, there is often a mismatch between the resolution of the model output and parcel-level land management, at which ES information is often most valuable for supporting decision-making."
Cascading consequences of shifting ice phenology in an exploited lake,"Daisuke,Erin S.,Joelle D.,Donald A.,Daisuke,Erin S.,Joelle D.,Donald A.,Daisuke,Erin S.,Joelle D.,Donald A.","Ice phenology (onset and breakup of ice cover) regulates the timings of seasonal life history events of many animal and plant species in high-latitude lakes in the Northern Hemisphere, promoting the coexistence of species that share resources like food and shelter. Increasingly warmer, more variable Earth’s climate is, however, shifting ice phenology, modifying habitat conditions, and in turn reshaping the population and interaction dynamics of many species, threatening their persistence. Applying multivariate autoregressive state-space time series modeling to extensive historical and contemporary monitoring records (spanning 36 to 113 years) of limnological and biological surveys and fishery catches, we explore how shifting ice phenology propagates through a food web over time by modulating thermal profiles and limnological properties in Lake Simcoe, a large, intensely exploited system in southern Ontario, Canada. Analysis shows that increasingly earlier ice breakups, later ice freeze-ups, earlier thermal stratification onset, and later turnover since the early 1980s, attenuated algal production. This in turn, combined with increasingly more abundant invasive species (dreissenids) that promoted greater water clarity over prolonged stratification periods, diminished zooplankton abundances. These limnological changes filtered through plankton communities further modified the population and community dynamics of higher trophic-level species like fish with differential thermal preferences, interactively with time-varying non-climate drivers. Although management interventions–reductions in nutrient loading and fishing effort in particular–in recent decades aided the recoveries of depleted cold-adapted fish populations (including lake trout, lake whitefish, and cisco), their interaction patterns and strengths with species adapted to warmer conditions were reshuffled by advanced timings of ice breakup and delayed timings of ice freeze-up. These findings reveal how complex food web dynamics can emerge from ecologically divergent responses that reshape species interactions within and among trophic levels under shifting ice phenology filtered through bottom-up processes, likely buffering destabilizing effects of a changing climate."

Detailed, high-quality observations of when plants undergo seasonal transitions such as leaf-out, flowering, and fruiting are critical for tracking causes and consequences of phenology shifts, but these data are often sparse and biased globally. These data gaps limit broader generalizations and forecasting improvements in the face of continuing disturbance. One solution to closing such gaps is to document phenology on field images taken by public participants. iNaturalist, in particular, provides global scale research-grade data and is expanding rapidly. Here we utilize over 53 million field images of plants and millions of human annotations from iNaturalist – data spanning all angiosperms and drawn from across the globe – to train a computer vision model (PhenoVision) to detect the presence of fruits and flowers. PhenoVision utilizes a vision transformer architecture pretrained with a masked autoencoder to improve classification success, and it achieves high accuracy for flower (98.5%) and fruit presence (95%). Key to producing research-ready phenology data is post-calibration tuning and validation focused on reducing noise inherent in field photographs, and maximizing the true positive rate. We also develop a standardized set of quality metrics and metadata so that results can be used effectively by the community. Finally, we showcase how this effort vastly increases phenology data coverage, including regions of the globe where data have been limited before. Our end products are tuned models, new data resources, and an application streamlining discovery and use of those data for the broader research and management community. We close by discussing next steps, including automating phenology annotations, adding new phenology targets, e.g., leaf phenology, and further integration with other resources to form a global central database integrating all in-situ plant phenology resources."

Here we present an updated systematic review of cross-sectional malaria surveys to explore the prevalence and drivers of these submicroscopic infections and define where they are likely to be relevant to malaria control efforts. Our results show that submicroscopic infections predominate in low transmission settings, but also reveal marked geographical variation in their prevalence, being highest in South American surveys and lowest in West African studies. Whilst current transmission levels partly explain these results, we find that historical transmission intensity also represents a crucial determinant of the size of the submicroscopic reservoir. Submicroscopic infection was more likely in adults than children, although we did not observe a statistically significant influence of seasonality. Our results suggest that the contribution of submicroscopic infections to transmission likely varies substantially across settings, potentially warranting different approaches to their targeting in the approach to elimination."

Franklin,Michelle D.","Torsional stress in chromatin plays a fundamental role in cellular functions, influencing key processes such as transcription, replication, and chromatin organization. Transcription and other processes may generate and be regulated by torsional stress. In the genome, the interplay of these processes creates complicated patterns of both positive (+) and negative (-) torsion. However, a challenge in generating an accurate torsion map is determining the zero-torsion baseline signal, which is conflated with chromatin accessibility. Here, we introduce a high-resolution method based on the intercalator trimethylpsoralen (TMP) to address this challenge. We describe a method to establish the zero-torsion baseline while preserving the chromatin state of the genome. This approach enables both high-resolution mapping of accessibility and torsional stress in chromatin in the cell. Our analysis reveals transcription-generated torsional domains consistent with the twin-supercoiled-domain model of transcription and suggests a role for torsional stress in recruiting topoisomerases and in regulating 3D genome architecture via cohesin. This new method provides a potential path forward for using TMP to measure torsional stress in the genome without the confounding contribution of accessibility in chromatin."

Cross-scale dynamics and the evolutionary emergence of infectious diseases,"Sebastian J.,Ruian,Claude,Miran,Prianna,James O.,Sebastian J.,Ruian,Claude,Miran,Prianna,James O.,Sebastian J.,Ruian,Claude,Miran,Prianna,James O.","When emerging pathogens encounter new host species for which they are poorly adapted, they must evolve to escape extinction. Pathogens experience selection on traits at multiple scales, including replication rates within host individuals and transmissibility between hosts. We analyze a stochastic model linking pathogen growth and competition within individuals to transmission between individuals. Our analysis reveals a new factor, the cross-scale reproductive number of a mutant virion, that quantifies how quickly mutant strains increase in frequency when they initially appear in the infected host population. This cross-scale reproductive number combines with viral mutation rates, single-strain reproductive numbers, and transmission bottleneck width to determine the likelihood of evolutionary emergence, and whether evolution occurs swiftly or gradually within chains of transmission. We find that wider transmission bottlenecks facilitate emergence of pathogens with short-term infections, but hinder emergence of pathogens exhibiting cross-scale selective conflict and long-term infections. Our results provide a framework to advance the integration of laboratory, clinical and field data in the context of evolutionary theory, laying the foundation for a new generation of evidence-based risk assessment of emergence threats."
A Suite of Foundation Models Captures the Contextual Interplay Between Codons,"Mohsen,Siyu,Mathew K.,Christian B.,Ali,Timo,Mohammad R. K.,Willow,Hani,Mohsen,Siyu,Mathew K.,Christian B.,Ali,Timo,Mohammad R. K.,Willow,Hani,Mohsen,Siyu,Mathew K.,Christian B.,Ali,Timo,Mohammad R. K.,Willow,Hani","In the canonical genetic code, many amino acids are assigned more than one codon. Work by us and others has shown that the choice of these synonymous codon is not random, and carries regulatory and functional consequences. Existing protein foundation models ignore this context-dependent role of coding sequence in shaping the protein landscape of the cell. To address this gap, we introduce cdsFM, a suite of codon-resolution large language models, including both EnCodon and DeCodon models, with up to 1B parameters. Pre-trained on 60 million protein-coding sequences from more than 5,000 species, our models effectively learn the relationship between codons and amino acids, recapitualing the overall structure of the genetic code. In addition to outperforming state-of-the-art genomic foundation models in a variety of zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks, the larger pre-trained models were superior in predicting the choice of synonymous codons. To systematically assess the impact of synonymous codon choices on protein expression and our models’ ability to capture these effects, we generated a large dataset measuring overall and surface expression levels of three proteins as a function of changes in their synonymous codons. We showed that our EnCodon models could be readily fine-tuned to predict the contextual consequences of synonymous codon choices. Armed with this knowledge, we applied EnCodon to existing clinical datasets of synonymous variants, and we identified a large number of synonymous codons that are likely pathogenic, several of which we experimentally confirmed in a cellbased model. Together, our findings establish the cdsFM suite as a powerful tool for decoding the complex functional grammar underlying the choice of synonymous codons."
Pangenome Reveals Gene Content Variations and Structural Variants Contributing to Pig Characteristics,"Heng,Yue,Shiyu,Wanying,Lei,Feizhou,Gang,Jian-Feng,Heng,Yue,Shiyu,Wanying,Lei,Feizhou,Gang,Jian-Feng,Heng,Yue,Shiyu,Wanying,Lei,Feizhou,Gang,Jian-Feng","Pigs are among the most essential sources of high-quality protein in human diets. Structural variants (SVs) are a major source of genetic variants associated with diverse traits and evolutionary events. However, the current linear reference genome of pigs limits the presentation of position information for SVs. In this study, we generated a pangenome of pigs and a genome variation map of 599 deep-sequenced genomes across Eurasia. Moreover, a section-wide gene repertoire was constructed, which indicated that core genes were more evolutionarily conserved than variable genes. Subsequently, we identified 546,137 SVs, their enrichment regions, and relationships with genomic features and found significant divergence across Eurasian pigs. More importantly, the pangenome-detected SVs could complement heritability estimates and genome-wide association studies based only on single nucleotide polymorphisms. Among the SVs shaped by selection, we identified an insertion in the promoter region of the , gene, which may be related to the development, growth, and timidity traits of Asian pigs and may affect the gene expression. Our constructed pig pangenome and the identified SVs provide rich resources for future functional genomic research on pigs."
Public RNA-seq data are not representative of global human diversity,"Irene Gallego,Grace,Audrey M.,Lani,Isobel J.,Ryan,Nicholas,Selina,Amanda J.,Irene Gallego,Grace,Audrey M.,Lani,Isobel J.,Ryan,Nicholas,Selina,Amanda J.,Irene Gallego,Grace,Audrey M.,Lani,Isobel J.,Ryan,Nicholas,Selina,Amanda J.","The field of human genetics has reached a consensus that it is important to work with diverse and globally representative participant groups. This diverse sampling is required to build a robust understanding of the genomic basis of complex traits and diseases as well as human evolution, and to ensure that all people benefit from downstream scientific discoveries. While previous work has characterized compositional biases and disparities for public genome-wide association (GWAS), microbiome, and epigenomic studies, we currently lack a comprehensive understanding of the degree of bias for transcriptomic studies. To address this gap, we analyzed the metadata for RNA-seq studies from two public databases—the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), representing 795,071 samples from 21,209 studies, and the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP), representing 167,389 samples from 649 studies. We also randomly selected 620 studies from SRA for detailed, manual evaluation. We found that 3% of samples in SRA and 21% of individuals described in the literature had population descriptors (race, ethnicity, or ancestry); 28% of samples in dbGaP had paired genotype data that was used to empirically infer ancestry. In SRA, dbGaP, and the literature, race, ethnicity, and ancestry terms were frequently conflated and difficult to disambiguate. After standardizing population descriptors, we observed many clear biases: for example, among samples in SRA that were coded using US Census terms, 69.0% came from white donors, corresponding to an 1.2x overrepresentation of this group relative to the US population. Among samples in SRA coded using continental ancestry labels, 55.6% came from European ancestry donors—an 4.1x overrepresentation of this group relative to the global population. These biases were generally similar across datasets (SRA, dbGaP, literature review), and were comparable to previous reports for other ‘omics data types. However, we note that, relative to other ‘omics data subsets like GWAS, there is considerably less information, of arguably worse quality, about who is participating in RNA-seq studies. Together, these results demonstrate a critical need to improve our thoughtfulness, consistency, and effort around reporting population descriptors in RNA-seq studies, and to more generally strive for greater diversity in this important data type."

"Methylparaben dampens virulence and transmissibility of the , pathogen ","Youn,Berta,Christine,Tadeusz J.,Youn,Berta,Christine,Tadeusz J.,Youn,Berta,Christine,Tadeusz J.","In the last 20 years, , (Pe) has emerged as a model to explore insect immunity to bacterial intestinal pathogens. Laboratory studies evidenced multiple detrimental effects of Pe on ,. However, these effects require that the bacteria are ingested in extremely high concentrations of 10, – 10, CFU per mL (OD, 20 – 200), questioning the relevance of this pathogen in nature. Here, we tested whether the need for such high doses may be due to protective effects of the food preservative methylparaben (Nipagin), a standard ingredient of artificial , diets. While significant mortality in flies fed diet containing standard methylparaben concentration required doses of >10, CFU per mL, when methylparaben was absent we could observe mortality using 500,000× lower doses. Consistent with these results, we demonstrated strong bactericidal properties of methylparaben on Pe ,. In the absence of methylparaben even the smallest inocula (10, CFU per mL) led to high bacterial loads (10, CFU per fly) after several days, indicating the ability of Pe to grow and overcome the flies’ defenses. We also demonstrate that in the absence of methylparaben, infected flies could easily transmit the pathogen to other adults and to offspring, resulting in high mortality and thus highlighting the potential of Pe as a pathogen of , in nature. Our study also underscores that careful consideration should be given to food additives used in standard diets in laboratory research on host-pathogen interaction."
Detection and Annotation of Unique Regions in Mammalian Genomes,"Beatriz,Bernhard,Beatriz,Bernhard,Beatriz,Bernhard","Long unique genomic regions have been reported to be highly enriched for developmental genes in mice and humans. In this paper we identify unique genomic regions using a highly efficient method based on fast string matching. We quantify the resource consumption and accuracy of this method before applying it to the genomes of 18 mammals. We annotate their unique regions of at least 10 kb and find that they are strongly enriched for developmental genes across the board. When investigating the subset of unique regions that lack annotations, we found in the tasmanian devil the gene encoding iniositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase A, which is an essential part of intracellular signaling. This implies that unique regions might be given priority when annotating mammalian genomes. Our documented pipeline for annotating unique regions in any mammalian genome is available from the repository ,; additional data for this study is available from the data-verse at doi.org/10.17617/3.4IKQAG."
Comparative impact of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus and swine influenza A virus infections on respiratory lymph nodes B cells and macrophages,"C.,A.,P.,C.,M.,F.,J.,G.,O.,P.,N.,C.,A.,P.,C.,M.,F.,J.,G.,O.,P.,N.,C.,A.,P.,C.,M.,F.,J.,G.,O.,P.,N.","Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) strongly impacts the pig rearing sector due to its persistence in infected animals. Interestingly, although the PRRSV family exhibits considerable genome variability, with the PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 subtypes having been finally classified in two different species (Betaarterivirus suid 1 and 2). Both viruses, as well as their derived-attenuated vaccine strains, persist for months, due in part to their ability to delay the appearance of neutralizing antibodies. Thanks to extensive efforts over the past years, we have developed the capability to perform in-depth analysis of the previously poorly understood porcine inverted lymph node (LN). In this study, by comparing the early stages of LN B cell maturation upon PRRSV-1 infection to those induced upon the acute swine influenza A virus infection, we highlighted PRRSV-specific mechanisms, including the expression of PD-L1 in efferent macrophages, the induction of extrafollicular plasmocytes, and the influx of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages. Studies on PRRSV-2 infections report observations compatible with our results, that thus might be generalized to all PRRSV-strains. Moreover, these mechanisms can be compared with those used by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the murine chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) to hijack the immune response. These similarities can be harnessed to develop new strategies to improve the development of more efficient anti-PRRSV vaccines."
Multi-modal profiling identifies CD4+CXCR5+PD-1- Tfh cells as prognostic and predictive biomarkers for response to R-CHOP therapy in human DLBCL,"Sisi,Hao,Huaichao,xingzhong,Guanghui,Xiuqin,Jie,Xiangji,Yu,Chunwei,James,Dan,Yang,Hong,Ping,Sisi,Hao,Huaichao,xingzhong,Guanghui,Xiuqin,Jie,Xiangji,Yu,Chunwei,James,Dan,Yang,Hong,Ping,Sisi,Hao,Huaichao,xingzhong,Guanghui,Xiuqin,Jie,Xiangji,Yu,Chunwei,James,Dan,Yang,Hong,Ping","Despite the improvements in clinical outcomes for patients with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), a significant proportion of those patients still face challenges with refractory/relapsed (R/R) disease after receiving first-line R-CHOP treatment. Characterizing the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is crucial for understanding relapsed/refractory disease. However, the complex and diverse nature of the TME has impeded progress. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing(scRNA-seq), we explored the DLBCL landscape at single-cell resolution, profiling 77,344 cells from both primary and relapsed DLBCL patients. We further investigated the shared and distinct molecular and cellular features of tumor microenvironment in both primary and relapsed DLBCL tumors by integrating next-generation DNA sequencing data and multiple scRNA-seq datasets from total 72,351 cells. Our results demonstrated that there was a significant decrease of CD4+CXCR5+PD-1- Tfh cells, along with excessive activation of the TNF-NFκB signaling pathways in malignant B cells in R/R disease. Furthermore, by using multiplex IHC, we confirmed that CD4+CXCR5+PD-1- Tfh cells are prognostic and predictive biomarkers for response to R-CHOP treatment. As a proof of concept, we successfully generated mutilplexed images of CD4+CXCR5+PD-1- Tfh cells from a single DAPI staining in human DLBCL tissues through using generative artificial intelligence. Our study offers critical insights into the heterogeneity and molecular features of DLBCL, shedding light on the crucial role of CD4+CXCR5+PD-1- Tfh cells in the recurrent process."
Protection against Poly Microbial Sepsis by Chitin oligomers is fine tuned by N-Acetyl D-Glucosamine residues,"Paresh,Geetanjali,Shilpa,Balachandran,Taslimarif,Paresh,Geetanjali,Shilpa,Balachandran,Taslimarif,Paresh,Geetanjali,Shilpa,Balachandran,Taslimarif","Chitin, poly-N Acetyl D- glucosamine, is an abundant polysaccharide produced by fungal cell walls, insect epicuticle and nematodes cuticles. Its immunomodulatory function has curious attributes - paradoxically opposing host responses using different host receptors resulting in immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive propertis depending on the size/length of the oligomers as well as aceytylation levels have been reported in literature.  Here we demonstrate that Hepta-N-Acetyl Chitoheptaose (7 mer) is a TLR2 ligand,  8 mer activates immune cells through TLR4 while, 6 mer is a relatively poor ligand for both TLR2 and TLR4 in generating inflammatory host cytokines.  Significantly enhanced inflammatory response characterized by increased TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-10 was a feature of only 8 mer while, 6 and 7 mers induced modest activation in both HEK cells (transfected with specific TLRs) and in human THP2 cells in vitro. The translational significance of these features were addressed in an experimental model of Sepsis using Cecal Ligation Puncture (CLP) protocol, a murine model, considered a gold standard for human Sepsis. More significantly, therapeutic rather than prophylactic administration, that simulates real life scenerio of human and animal sepsis, of 7 mer rather than 6 or 8 residues of Chitin oligomer, significantly protected mice against sepsis as shown by decreased mortality and decreased induction of inflammatory cytokines. These findings suggest that modulation of immune response by chitopolysaccarides in-vivo is precisely caliberated."
AxSpA joint tissue is characterised by HLA-DR+ tissue resident memory (TRM) and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)+ CD8+ T cell subsets,"Feng,Hui,Jiewei,Ben,Dajing,Paul,Qiang,Liye,Feng,Hui,Jiewei,Ben,Dajing,Paul,Qiang,Liye,Feng,Hui,Jiewei,Ben,Dajing,Paul,Qiang,Liye","Objective: Axial Spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) is a common inflammatory arthritis with HLA-B*27 as the major genetic risk. Recent discoveries of AxSpA-specific T cell receptor (TCR) motifs and the self and bacterial peptides that they recognize support a pathogenic role of CD8+ T cells. Despite of previous work on synovial fluid, the characteristics of CD8 cells in joint tissue are currently unknown.
Method: Synovial tissues from 5 AxSpA patients were used for single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq). Paired TCR sequencing was carried out for 2. The abundance of KIR+ CD8+ T cells in the blood from 9 AxSpA patients and 10 healthy controls was measured using flow cytometry. The expression of naive and memory T cell markers (CCR7, CD45RA and CD45RO) were compared between KIR+ and KIR- CD8 cells.
Results: We observed conventional, TRAV1-2+ mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cell and MKI67+ proliferating cell populations in synovium. Following sub-clustering of conventional CD8+ T cells, HLA-DR+ tissue resident memory (TRM), circulating, KIR+ and FCGR3A+ (encoding CD16) cell subsets were observed. HLA-DR+ TRM and KIR+ cells were clonally expanded and exhibited distinct transcriptional features, enriched for T cell activation pathways and natural killer (NK) cell mediated cytotoxicity pathway respectively. Lastly, KIR+CD8+ T cells were increased in AxSpA blood and enriched for CD45RA+CCR7- TEMRA cells.
Conclusion: Here we present the very first transcriptomic profiling of CD8+ T cells in synovium tissue and highlight potential roles of HLA-DR+ TRM and KIR+ cells in AxSpA pathology. This study adds novel insights to the disease mechanisms and offers new therapeutic opportunities."

EMC regulates cell membrane fluidity to facilitate biogenesis of membrane proteins,"Modesto,Victor,Juan,Modesto,Victor,Juan,Modesto,Victor,Juan","The EMC complex is a highly conserved transmembrane chaperone located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This complex has been associated in humans with sterol homeostasis and a myriad of different cellular activities, making the mechanism of EMC functionality enigmatic. Using fission yeast, we demonstrate that EMC assists biogenesis of the sterol transfer protein Lam6/Ltc1 at the ER-Plasma membrane and ER-Mitochondria contact sites. Cells losing EMC function sequester unfolded Lam6/Ltc1 and other proteins at the mitochondrial matrix, driving to surplus ergosterol, cold-sensitive growth and mitochondrial disfunctions. Remarkably, inhibition of the ergosterol biosynthesis, but also fluidization of cell membranes to counteract its rigidizing effects, reduce the ER-unfolded protein response and rescue growth and mitochondrial defects in EMC-deficient cells. These results indicate that EMC-assisted biogenesis of Lam6/Ltc1 provides, through ergosterol homeostasis, optimal membrane fluidity to facilitate biogenesis of other ER-membrane proteins."

Inhibiting GSL production by targeting the enzymes UGP2 or UGCG impairs CD8, T cell expansion and cytolytic activity without affecting glucose-dependent energy production. Mechanistically, we show that glucose-dependent GSL biosynthesis is required for plasma membrane lipid raft integrity and aggregation following TCR stimulation.

Although often grouped together, Presenilin-1 (PS1) and Presenilin-2 (PS2) are distinct proteins that contribute differently to γ-secretase activity. This study examines the differential expression of PS1 and PS2 in various neuroblastoma and microglial cell lines, along with compensatory responses following the ablation of one presenilin homologue. Using quantitative immunoblotting, we show that PS1 and PS2 expression levels vary significantly across cell types. Notably, the ablation of PS2 results in increased PS1 expression, particularly in microglial cells, highlighting the importance of PS2. Additionally, neuronal differentiation of two neuroblastoma lines, caused changes in protein expression levels resulting in similar expression profiles of PS1 and PS2, with PS2 levels being higher than PS1. Understanding PS expression profiles is crucial for distinguishing between PS1- and PS2-mediated γ-secretase activity and for developing γ-secretase-targeted therapeutics with improved selectivity."

DAG subspecies with different fatty-acyl chains are proposed to be involved in the activation of distinct PKC isoforms, resulting in diverse physiological outcomes. However, the molecular players and the regulatory origin for fine-tuning the PKC pathway are unknown. Here, we show that Dip2, a conserved DAG regulator across Fungi and Animalia, has emerged as a modulator of PKC signalling in yeast. Dip2 maintains the level of a specific DAG subpopulation, required for the activation of PKC-mediated cell wall integrity pathway. Interestingly, the canonical DAG-metabolism pathways, being promiscuous, are decoupled from PKC signalling. We demonstrate that these DAG subspecies are sourced from a phosphatidylinositol pool generated by the acyl-chain remodelling pathway. Furthermore, we provide insights into the intimate coevolutionary relationship between the regulator (Dip2) and the effector (PKC) of DAG-based signalling. Hence, our study underscores the establishment of Dip2-PKC axis about 1.2 billion years ago in Opisthokonta, which marks the rooting of the first specific DAG-based signalling module of eukaryotes."
Cambrian origin of the arachnid brain reveals early divergence of Chelicerata,"Nicholas J.,Frank,Nicholas J.,Frank,Nicholas J.,Frank","Fossils from the lower Cambrian provide crucial insights into the origin of arthropod lineages: Mandibulata, exemplified by centipedes, insects, and crustaceans; and Chelicerata, whose descendants include sea spiders and horseshoe crabs and terrestrial spiders, scorpions, and ticks.

Here, we demonstrate singularly preserved trace neuronal tissues that identify a cerebral organization of , uniquely distinct from brains attributed to upper stem euarthopods. The fossilized neural traces reveal a copious asegmental cerebrum lying above contiguous ganglia associated with their clustered appendages. This arrangement exclusively characterizes the central nervous systems of extant arachnids.

Membrane potential modulates ERK activity and cell proliferation,"Mari,Masanobu,Takuya,Fumihito,Mari,Masanobu,Takuya,Fumihito,Mari,Masanobu,Takuya,Fumihito","The plasma membrane potential has been linked to cell proliferation for more than 40 years. Here we experimentally showed that membrane depolarization upregulates cell mitosis, and that this process is dependent on voltage-dependent activation of ERK.  ERK activity exhibits a membrane potential-dependency that is independent from the growth factor. This membrane potential dependence was observed even close to the resting membrane potential, indicating that small changes in resting membrane potential can alter cell proliferative activity. The voltage-dependent ERK activity is derived from changed dynamics of phosphatidylserine which is present in the plasma membrane and not by extracellular calcium entry. The data suggests that crucial biological processes such as cell proliferation are regulated by the physicochemical properties of the lipid.　This study suggests that membrane potential may have diverse physiological functions beyond the action potential, which is well-established in the neural system."

Despite their importance, measuring free polyamine concentrations and monitoring their metabolism and uptake in cells in real-time remains impossible due to the lack of appropriate biosensors. Here we engineered, characterized, and validated the first genetically encoded biosensors for polyamines, named iPASnFRs. We demonstrate the utility of iPASnFR for detecting polyamine import into mammalian cells, to the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and the nucleus. We demonstrate that these sensors are useful to probe the activity of polyamine transporters and to uncover biochemical pathways underlying the distribution of polyamines amongst organelles. The sensors powered a high-throughput small molecule compound library screen, revealing multiple compounds in different chemical classes that strongly modulate cellular polyamine levels. These sensors will be powerful tools to investigate the complex interplay between polyamine uptake and metabolic pathways, address open questions about their role in health and disease, and enable screening for therapeutic polyamine modulators."

We earlier reported that murine Cdx2 cells restored cardiac function after intravenous delivery in male mice with experimental myocardial infarction (MI). Here we demonstrate that CDX2 cells found in human chorion are poised for cardiovascular differentiation. We isolated CDX2 cells from term placentas of 150 healthy patients and showed that they spontaneously differentiate into cardiomyocytes, functional vascular cells, and retain homing ability in vitro with a transcriptome that supports enhanced cardiogenesis, vasculogenesis, immune modulation, and chemotaxis gene signatures.  They restore cardiac function when administered to NOD/SCID mice subjected to MI. CDX2 cells can be clonally propagated in culture with retention of cardiovascular differentiation.

β-adrenergic blockers increase cAMP and stimulate insulin secretion through a PKA/RYR2/TRPM5 pathway in pancreatic β-cells in vitro,"Naoya,Risa,Yusuke,Kenju,Yuko,Yuichiro,Atsushi,Naoya,Risa,Yusuke,Kenju,Yuko,Yuichiro,Atsushi,Naoya,Risa,Yusuke,Kenju,Yuko,Yuichiro,Atsushi","β-adrenergic blockers (β-blockers) are extensively utilized in the treatment of various cardiovascular conditions. However, their direct effects on insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells remain largely unexplored. This study investigates the impact of β-blockers on insulin secretion utilizing MIN6-K8 clonal β-cells and mouse islets in vitro. Various non-selective and β1-selective β-blockers were found to amplify glucose- and glimepiride-induced insulin secretion 1.5-2 fold. Surprisingly, some of the β-blockers (propranolol and bisoprolol) were found to increase cAMP production 5-10 fold via adenylyl cyclase, the effects being dependent on α2-adrenoceptors, which suggests cross-reactivity of these β-blockers and their receptors. Propranolol-stimulated insulin secretion involves a novel signaling pathway mediated by protein kinase A (PKA), ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 5 (TRPM5). Initially, cAMP activates PKA and triggers RYR2 phosphorylation and extracellular Ca, influx, leading to Ca,-induced Ca, release (CICR). Subsequently, CICR activates TRPM5, resulting in augmented extracellular Ca, influx through the L-type voltage-dependent Ca, channel (VDCC). Remarkably, propranolol-stimulated insulin secretion exhibited greater efficacy in diabetic mouse islets than in lean mouse islets, suggesting a potential strategy for the restoration of cAMP-stimulated insulin secretion in diabetic β-cells. Our findings provide insights into the fundamental pharmacology of adrenoceptors and the regulatory mechanisms of insulin secretion."
SERPINB5-TGF-β signalling modulates desmoplakin membrane localization and ameliorates pemphigus vulgaris skin blistering,"Maitreyi,Aude,Henriette,Tomas,Dario,Michael,Enno,Volker,Maitreyi,Aude,Henriette,Tomas,Dario,Michael,Enno,Volker,Maitreyi,Aude,Henriette,Tomas,Dario,Michael,Enno,Volker","Impairment of desmosomal cell-cell adhesion leads to several life-threatening diseases such as the autoimmune skin blistering disorder pemphigus vulgaris (PV). Disease management strategies that stabilize intercellular adhesion, in addition to the existing immunosuppression therapies, may result in improved clinical outcomes. Previous findings showed that the serine protease inhibitor SERPINB5 promotes intercellular adhesion by binding to and regulating the localization of the desmosomal adapter molecule desmoplakin (DSP) at the plasma membrane. We here show that SERPINB5 overexpression prevents PV-IgG-mediated loss of cell-cell adhesion and the loss of DSP from the cell membrane. We mechanistically demonstrate that SERPINB5 loss deregulates TGF-β signalling, a pathway known to destabilize DSP in keratinocytes. TGF-β signalling was also activated in skin biopsies of PV patients and keratinocytes treated with PV autoantibodies, suggesting a contribution to disease. Inhibition of TGF-β activation ameliorated PV-IgG-mediated loss of cell-cell adhesion, increased DSP membrane expression, and prevented PV-IgG-induced blister formation in a human ex-vivo skin model. Together, SERPINB5 modulates DSP and intercellular adhesion through the regulation of TGF-β signalling. Further, TGF-β signalling was identified as a potential target for pemphigus treatment."
Modeling of Rate Heterogeneity in Datasets Compiled for Use With Parsimony,"April M.,Brenen M.,April M.,Brenen M.,April M.,Brenen M.","In recent years, there has been an increased interest in modeling morphological traits using Bayesian methods. Much of the work associated with modeling these characters has focused on the substitution or evolutionary model employed in the analysis. However, there are many other assumptions that researchers make in the modeling process that are consequential to estimated phylogenetic trees. One of these is how among-character rate variation (ACRV) is parameterized. In molecular data, a discretized gamma distribution is often used to allow different characters to have different rates of evolution. Morphological data are collected in ways that fundamentally differ from molecular data. In this paper, we appraise the use of standard parameters for ACRV and provide recommendations to researchers who work with morphological data in a Bayesian framework."

"The relationship between microbial community succession, decay, and anatomical character loss in non-biomineralised animals","Thomas,Robert,Sarah,Duncan,Martha,Andrew,Christopher,Orla,Mark,Thomas,Robert,Sarah,Duncan,Martha,Andrew,Christopher,Orla,Mark,Thomas,Robert,Sarah,Duncan,Martha,Andrew,Christopher,Orla,Mark","A fundamental assumption of hypothesis-driven decay experiments is that, during decay, the loss of anatomy follows a sequence broadly controlled by the intrinsic compositional properties of tissues. Recent work investigating the succession of postmortem endogenous microbial communities (thanatomicrobiome) challenges this assumption. These studies suggest the thanatomicrobiome exhibits a predictable, clock-like succession in response to physical and chemical environmental changes within a carcass. Therefore, it is possible that reproducible sequences of character loss during decay are controlled by thanatomicrobiome succession dynamics. If so, exceptionally preserved fossil anatomy would reflect a succession of ancient contemporaneous microbial communities, about which we know nothing, rendering decay experiments uninformative. Here, we investigate two questions: (1) what is the role of exogenous and endogenous bacteria during formation of the thanatomicrobiome and (2) do thanatomicrobiome successions control the sequence of anatomical character loss within a decaying carcass? Our analysis shows that the thanatomicrobiome is dominated by endogenous bacteria and that, even in the presence of inoculum, exogenous bacteria do not invade the carcass and replace native bacteria (while the carcass is intact). This confirms that the use of environmental inoculum in decay experiments introduces an inadvisable confounding variable. Secondly, we find no correlation between thanatomicrobiome successions and the sequence of anatomical character loss, supporting that fossil non-biomineralised characters correlate with their propensity to decay in extant relatives. These findings indicate that the inability to model ancient bacteria does not invalidate decay experiments. We also present a synthesis of the role of bacteria in non-biomineralised fossilisation."

The characteristics and systematic position of these specimens, however, have received little attention. In this study, a total of 307 Devonian stromatoporoid specimens comprising material documented by Nicholson (1886–1892) from the UK, Germany, United States, and Canada, plus specimens described by ,, ,, b, c) from Australia, were re-examined. Overall, 50 species belonging to 29 genera were systematically redescribed based on recent progress, mainly including ,, ,, ,, ,, ,. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the type genus are illustrated following the earlier works of , and Cockbain (1984). The reconstructed skeletons reveal stromatoporoid architectural patterns, crucial for enhancing understanding and revision of stromatoporoid identification. This study underscores the significance of three-dimensional reconstruction in taxonomic research on stromatoporoid. The NHMUK material is combined with data from publications and the Paleobiology Database (PBDB) to perform a network analysis of the global occurrence of Devonian stromatoporoids at the generic level; this reveals a close relationship of global stromatoporoid fauna during the Early Devonian, indicating a widespread distribution, despite this interval being regarded as a time of global stromatoporoid contraction. The Middle Devonian assemblage shows a much higher cosmopolitan occurrence in the context of the subsequent Eifelian-Givetian global stromatoporoid proliferation, consistent with the known pattern from other studies of Middle Devonian stromatoporoids. Overall, the NHMUK collections are a valuable resource to help understand the global occurrence of Devonian stromatoporoids."

"Oxygen chemoreceptor inhibition by dopamine D, receptors in isolated zebrafish gills","Maddison,Michael G.,Maddison,Michael G.,Maddison,Michael G.","Dopamine is an essential modulator of oxygen sensing and control of ventilation and was the first neurotransmitter described in the carotid body. Little is known of the evolutionary significance of dopamine in oxygen sensing, or whether it plays a similar role in anamniotes. In the model vertebrate, zebrafish (,), presynaptic dopamine D, receptor expression was demonstrated in gill neuroepithelial cells (NECs)—analogues of mammalian oxygen chemoreceptors; however, a mechanism for dopamine and D, in oxygen sensing in the gills had not been defined. The present study tested the hypothesis that presynaptic D, receptors provide a feedback mechanism that attenuates the chemoreceptor response to hypoxia. Using an isolated gill preparation from Tg(,:GCaMP6s) zebrafish, we measured hypoxia-induced changes in intracellular Ca, concentration ([Ca,],) in NECs and postsynaptic neurons. Activation of D, with dopamine or specific D, agonist, quinpirole, decreased hypoxic responses in NECs; whereas D, antagonist, domperidone, had the opposite effect. Addition of SQ22536, an adenylyl cyclase (AC) inhibitor, decreased the effect of hypoxia on [Ca,],, similar to dopamine. Activation of AC by forskolin partially recovered the suppressive effect of dopamine on the Ca, response to hypoxia. Further, we demonstrate that the response to hypoxia in postsynaptic sensory neurons was dependent upon innervation with NECs, and was subject to modulation by activation of presynaptic D,. Our results provide the first evidence of neurotransmission of the hypoxic signal at the NEC-nerve synapse in the gill and suggest that a presynaptic, modulatory role for dopamine in oxygen sensing arose early in vertebrate evolution."

Does PERM1 Regulate Systolic Cardiac Function? A Game of Numbers.,"Alexey V,Karthi,Brianna,Junco S,Alexey V,Karthi,Brianna,Junco S,Alexey V,Karthi,Brianna,Junco S","We and others demonstrated that PERM1 is a positive regulator of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the heart. However, discrepant results have emerged with regard to whether PERM1 loss-of-function affect cardiac contractility. In order to exclude the possibility that the reported negative results can be due to insufficient power of statistical test, we conducted a more robust echocardiography (Echo) analysis by increasing the sample size. We used Perm1-KO and their respective wildtype (WT) littermates, which were destined to tissue harvest. This yielded 84 WT mice and 88 Perm1-KO mice. We analyzed Echo-derived parameters of left ventricular (LV) systolic function. At the end of the study, ejection fraction (EF) was 65.43 +/- 7.13 in WT vs. 53.98 +/- 8.80 in Perm1-KO yielding p < 0.00000000000000004. Other parameters which reached statistically significant difference between WT and Perm1-KO (at p < 0.05) included LV fractional shortening (FS), LV diastolic and systolic diameters, LV anterior and posterior systolic wall thickness, LV posterior wall systolic thickening, stroke volume, and cardiac output (CO). Retrospectively, a p value < 0.05 was consistently achieved in assessment of EF only after average N per group reached 13. Larger minimal N per group were required for other parameters. Of interest, in both groups there were no correlation between EF% and CO. At the same time, in both groups EF strongly inversely correlated with LV diastolic diameter. This led us to a speculation that low EF may be in part compensated by an increased LV circumference, for the purpose of maintaining invariant CO. Indeed, the intergroup difference in CO (6%) was much smaller than the intergroup difference in EF (18%). We conclude that PERM1 does regulate cardiac mechanics. Changes caused by constitutive Perm1-KO can be conceptualized as reduced contractility partially compensated by increased LV circumference. This study underscores the importance of sufficiently large sample size for detecting significant differences in Echo data."

"Effect of high-altitude exposure on skeletal muscle mitochondrial subcellular distribution, ultrastructure and respiration in sea-level residents","Camilla Tvede,Joachim,Niels,Anne-Kristine Meinild,Robert Acton,Carsten,Camilla Tvede,Joachim,Niels,Anne-Kristine Meinild,Robert Acton,Carsten,Camilla Tvede,Joachim,Niels,Anne-Kristine Meinild,Robert Acton,Carsten","Endurance exercise performance is associated with a well-developed skeletal muscle mitochondrial network, which is composed of subsarcolemmal mitochondria interconnected with intermyofibrillar mitochondria bending around the myofibrils. High-altitude exposure is typically incorporated in elite sport training regimens, but little is known about how this network adapts to an environment characterised by tissue hypoxia. For this reason, we investigated how high-altitude exposure affects mitochondrial subcellular distribution, ultrastructure, respiratory control, and intrinsic mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Nine healthy and recreationally active sea-level residents (eight males and one female) resided at an altitude of 3454 m with biopsies collected from the vastus lateralis muscle before and after 7 and 28 days at high altitude. The muscular mitochondrial volume density (MitoVD) increased after high-altitude exposure, driven by an increase in the intermyofibrillar MitoVD. This was however accompanied by a decreased cristae surface area per skeletal muscle fibre volume (MuscularCD) because of a decline in the cristae surface area per mitochondrial volume (MitoCD). Despite a reduced MuscularCD, mass-specific maximal coupled respiration (OXPHOS_CII+CI+ETF) increased slightly, and was considerably elevated when normalised to MuscularCD, suggesting intrinsic adaptations to high altitude. The difference between cristae-specific OXPHOS_CII+CI+ETF and an associated cristae-specific leak respiration (Leak_CII+CI+ETF) indicated a markedly higher degree of coupling between the electron flow in the electron transport system and ATP production. As the effect size 95% confidence intervals includes trivial effects the results need to be substantiated. In conclusion, high-altitude exposure altered mitochondrial subcellular distribution, ultrastructure and induced intrinsic respiratory adaptations."
FieldDino: High-throughput physio-morphological phenotyping of stomatal characteristics for plant breeding research,"Edward D,Guy RY,Andrew,William T,Edward D,Guy RY,Andrew,William T,Edward D,Guy RY,Andrew,William T","Stomatal anatomy and physiology define CO2 availability for photosynthesis and regulate plant water use. Despite being key drivers of yield and dynamic responsiveness to abiotic stresses, conventional measurement techniques of stomatal traits are laborious and slow, limiting adoption in plant breeding. Advances in instrumentation and data analyses present an opportunity to screen stomatal traits at scales relevant to plant breeding. We present a high-throughput field-based phenotyping approach, FieldDino, for screening of stomatal physiology and anatomy. The method allows coupled measurements to be collected in <15 s and consists of: (1) stomatal conductance measurements using a handheld porometer; (2) in situ collection of epidermal images with a digital microscope, 3D-printed leaf clip and Python-based app; and (3) automated deep learning analysis of stomatal features. The YOLOv8-M model trained on images collected in the field achieved strong performance metrics with an mAP@0.5 of 97.1% for stomatal detection. Validation in large field trials of 200 wheat genotypes with two irrigation treatments captured wide diversity in stomatal traits. FieldDino enables stomatal data collection and analysis at unprecedented scales in the field. This will advance research on stomatal biology and accelerate the incorporation of stomatal traits into plant breeding programs for resilience to abiotic stress."
Lead as a toxic environmental toxicant in models of synucleinopathies,"Liana,Ângela,Filipa,Isabel,Vera,Tiago F.,Liana,Ângela,Filipa,Isabel,Vera,Tiago F.,Liana,Ângela,Filipa,Isabel,Vera,Tiago F.","Lead, a toxic heavy metal, is prevalent in various industrial applications, contributing to environmental contamination and significant health concerns. Lead affects various body systems, especially the brain, causing long-lasting cognitive and behavioral changes. While most studies have focused on continuous lead exposure, intermittent exposure, such as that caused by migration or relocations, has received less attention. Importantly, lead exposure intensifies the severity of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies, diseases involving the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) in the brain and in the gut. Although, the precise mechanisms underlying these observations remain unclear, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction likely play a role. Here, we investigated how two different profiles of lead exposure - continuous and intermittent - affect models of synucleinopathies. We found that lead exposure enhances the formation of aSyn inclusions, resulting in an increase in both their number and size in cell models. In addition, we found that animals injected with aSyn pre-formed fibrils display serine 129-phosphorylated aSyn inclusions and a reduction in astrocytes in the substantia nigra. These animals also display neuronal damage and alterations in locomotor activity, exploratory behavior, anxiety, memory impairments and hypertension. Our results suggest a mechanistic link between environmental lead exposure and the onset and progression of diseases associated with aSyn pathology. Understanding the molecular and cellular interactions between lead and aSyn is crucial for shaping public health policies and may provide novel insight into strategies for mitigating the impact of environmental toxins on neurodegenerative processes involved in Parkinson’s disease and related synucleinopathies."

The ventral hippocampus (vHPC) controls emotional and motivated behaviors in response to environmental cues and is hypothesized to do so in part by deciphering the positive or negative quality of these cues. Yet, what features of the environment are represented in the activity patterns of vCA1 neurons, and whether the positive or negative meaning of a stimulus is present at this stage, remains unclear. Here, using 2-photon calcium imaging across six different experimental paradigms, we consistently found that vCA1 ensembles encode the identity, sensory features, and intensity of learned and innately salient stimuli, but not their overall valence. These results offer a reappraisal of vCA1 function, wherein information corresponding to individual stimulus features and their behavioral saliency predominates, while valence-related information is attached elsewhere."
Temporally delayed representations in alpha and beta rhythms in higher-order cortical networks track increasing relational integration demands,"Conor N,Luca,Takuya,Luke J,Conor N,Luca,Takuya,Luke J,Conor N,Luca,Takuya,Luke J","Relational reasoning is the ability to infer and understand the relations between multiple elements. In humans, this ability supports higher cognitive functions and is linked to fluid intelligence. Relational complexity (RC) is a cognitive framework that offers a generalisable method for classifying the complexity of reasoning problems. To date, increased RC has been linked to static patterns of brain activity supported by the frontoparietal system, but limited work has assessed the multivariate spatiotemporal dynamics that code for RC. To address this, we conducted representational similarity analysis in two independent neuroimaging datasets (Dataset 1 fMRI, n=40; Dataset 2 EEG, n=45), where brain activity was recorded while participants completed a visuospatial reasoning task that included different levels of RC (Latin Square Task). Our findings revealed that, spatially, RC representations were widespread, peaking in brain networks associated with higher-order cognition (frontoparietal, dorsal-attention, and cingulo-opercular). Temporally, RC was represented in the 2.5 - 4.1 seconds post-stimuli window and emerged in the alpha and beta frequency range. Finally, multimodal fusion analysis revealed the information carried in the representation is concordant with the theorised RC model relative to a model of cognitive effort in higher-order cortical networks. Altogether, the results further our understanding of what information is held during relational processing, highlight the spatially distributed nature of RC representations, and emphasise the importance of late frequency-resolved neural processes to resolve RC. Significance statement: Assessing cognitive abilities in human reasoning requires a cognitive framework that can define the complexity of a problem. Relational complexity (RC) theory has emerged as a robust framework, parameterising complexity based on the number of relations that must be processed in parallel to solve a problem's underlying relational representation. To investigate where or when the brain codes for this cognitive abstraction, our study examined multimodal whole-brain activity during short reasoning problems at various complexity levels. We found that higher-cortical networks coded a representation tracking the transition between complexity demands, emerging during late-stage cognitive processing. Our findings provide neuroscientific evidence for a neural coding of relational complexity, pinpointing the frequency-resolved dynamics associated with these mechanisms."
Temporal Prediction through Integration of Probability Distributions of Event Timings at Multiple Levels,"Yiyuan Teresa,Zenas C.,Yiyuan Teresa,Zenas C.,Yiyuan Teresa,Zenas C.","Our brain uses prior experience to anticipate the timing of upcoming events. This dynamical process can be modeled using a hazard function derived from the probability distribution of event timings. However, the contexts of an event can lead to various probability distributions for the same event, and it remains unclear how the brain integrates these distributions into a coherent temporal prediction. In this study, we create a local-global foreperiod paradigm consisting of a sequence of paired trials, where in each trial, participants respond to a target signal after a specified time interval (i.e. foreperiod) following a warning cue. The prediction of the target onset in the second trial can be based on the probability distribution of the second foreperiod (local level) and its conditional probability given the foreperiod in the first trial (global level). These probability distributions are then transformed into hazard functions to represent the local and global temporal predictions. Reaction times to the target signal are best explained by incorporating both local and global predictions, indicating that both levels of temporal information contribute to making predictions. We further show that electroencephalographic source signals are best reconstructed when integrating both predictions. Specifically, the local and global predictions are separately encoded in the posterior and anterior brain regions, and to achieve synergy between both predictions, a third region—particularly the right posterior cingulate area—is needed. Our study reveals brain networks that integrate multilevel temporal information, providing a comprehensive view of hierarchical predictive coding of time."
Role of dopamine in reward expectation and predictability during execution of action sequences,"Robin,Yifeng,Joanna,Haley,Nathalie,Patricia H,Youna,Robin,Yifeng,Joanna,Haley,Nathalie,Patricia H,Youna,Robin,Yifeng,Joanna,Haley,Nathalie,Patricia H,Youna","Reward-associated cues serve different functions depending on whether they precede or terminate action sequences. Cues that precede action sequences and signal opportunity for reward could serve as GO signals to initiate the sequence, whereas sequence termination cues could serve as response feedback by signaling reward delivery. Reward expectation during sequence execution depends on these cues and might condition whether behavior is habitual or goal-directed. However, it remains unknown how sequence initiation and termination cues differentially affect reward expectation and contribute to habit learning. Further, while mesolimbic dopamine plays a key role in cue-induced reward expectation and sequence learning, how dynamic changes in dopamine signals differ depending on the response strategy is unclear. Here, we determined how mesolimbic DA signals change over training during cue-mediated sequence learning, depending on the type of cue and the nature of behavioral control. We found sequence initiation and termination cues differentially affect reward expectation during action sequences, with the termination cue contributing to habit and automaticity. Distinct response strategies induced by sequence initiation and termination cues induced differential changes in mesolimbic DA signals that captured variations in reward expectation along sequence execution. Notably, habit-like behavior induced by the sequence termination cue was associated with a rapid shift in DA signals from reward retrieval to the cue. This habit-like behavior was reflected in behavioral inflexibility and attenuated DA reward prediction error signals. Finally, using optogenetics, we provide evidence that phasic DA activity elicited by the sequence termination cue is critical for the development of habit-like behavior."

However, it was not fully clear whether the effects of GLP-1 were mediated by direct or indirect actions on bone cells. In the present study, we were unable to demonstrate the expression of the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1r) in bone tissue at the gene expression level using qPCR and in situ hybridization, or at the protein level. Furthermore, the peripheral administration of exendin-4, a specific GLP-1r agonist, in ovariectomized (OVX) BALB/c mice enhanced post-yield displacement (18%) and energy-to-fracture (24%), as well as bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) (11%), trabecular number (Tb.N) (6%), and collagen maturity (18%). These bone effects were still observed when exendin-4 was centrally administered into the lateral cerebral ventricle. On the other hand, the peripheral administration of exendin-4 coupled to bovine serum albumin, a GLP-1r agonist that cannot penetrate the brain, failed to replicate the positive effects on bone despite increased calcitonin secretion. Altogether, these data confirm that GLP-1r agonists represent an interesting approach for managing bone fragility due to ovariectomy, but also suggest that GLP-1r agonists require a central relay yet to be identified to exert positive effects on bone physiology. Further studies are needed to decipher the mechanisms of action of GLP-1 and GLP-1r agonists on bone physiology."
Early-Life Behavior Phenotypes and Cortisol Responses to Common Lab Stressors in a Cichlid Fish,"Alyssa P.,Eliyah R.,June,Abigail G.,Tessa K.,Alyssa P.,Eliyah R.,June,Abigail G.,Tessa K.,Alyssa P.,Eliyah R.,June,Abigail G.,Tessa K.","The stress response is highly conserved across species, and increased glucocorticoid release (cortisol in fishes) is a key element. In the highly social cichlid fish, Burton’s Mouthbrooder (,), stress axis activity is associated with juvenile social behavior and status, and it mediates early-life social effects, yet little is known about early-life stress physiology. We measured water-borne cortisol, a non-invasive method, in juveniles less than 1-week old. We first tested whether juveniles habituate to the beaker confinement necessary for sample collection. Repeated exposure to a beaker did not affect cortisol compared to handled and unhandled controls. In a separate cohort, we next measured behavior in an open field exploration and social cue investigation, followed by a test of whether common lab stressors elevated cortisol. Controls were undisturbed in a collection beaker (90 min). For the stressor treatments, we collected three sequential samples (30 min each) to try and quantify stress response peak and recovery; however, we found no effect of time. Stressors included handling, brief net confinement, and brief gentle movement. These stressors led to a significant increase in cortisol, with the highest levels resulting from confinement. The behavior tests revealed a bold-shy axis across both tests, describing the behavior of most individuals. A distinct group of socially-motivated juveniles showed a dramatic switch, staying in the territory during the open field but leaving to investigate the social cue. We found no associations between behavior and cortisol response. This work provides insight into early-life behavior and stress axis development and function."

"MLCK/MLCP regulates mammalian axon regeneration , the redistribution of the growth cone F-actin","Wei-Hua,Jin-Jin,Yin,Yan-Xia,Wei-Hua,Jin-Jin,Yin,Yan-Xia,Wei-Hua,Jin-Jin,Yin,Yan-Xia","Axon regrowth is a key determinant of the restoration of the biological function of the nervous system after trauma. However, mature mammalian neurons have limited capacity for axon regeneration. We have previously demonstrated that neuronal axon growth both in the central and the peripheral nervous systems is markedly enhanced when non-muscle myosin II (NMII) is inhibited with blebbistatin. The activity of NMII is primarily regulated by MLCK and MLCP , the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of its light chain, respectively; however, the functional roles of MLCK and MLCP in mammalian axonal regeneration remain unknown. In the present study, we provide strong evidence that the inhibition of MLCK activity significantly blocks axon regeneration in the mouse. Conversely, inhibition of MLCP promotes axon regrowth of both peripheral and central nervous system. Our findings further indicate that the MLCK/MLCP regulates axon regeneration via the reorganization of F-actin distribution in the growth cone, and this result suggests that direct regulation of the growth cone machinery is a potential strategy to promote axon regeneration."
Hibernation reduces GABA signaling in the brainstem to enhance motor activity of breathing at cool temperatures,"Sandy E.,Joseph M.,Sandy E.,Joseph M.,Sandy E.,Joseph M."," Neural circuits produce reliable activity patterns despite disturbances in the environment. For this to occur, neurons elicit synaptic plasticity during perturbations. However, recent work suggests that plasticity not only regulates circuit activity during disturbances, but these modifications may also linger to stabilize circuits during future perturbations. The implementation of such a regulation scheme for real-life environmental challenges of animals remains unclear. Amphibians provide insight into this problem in a rather extreme way, as circuits that generate breathing are inactive for several months during underwater hibernation and use compensatory plasticity to promote ventilation upon emergence."
Obesity Human Soluble Prorenin Receptor Expressed in Adipose Tissue Improves Insulin Sensitivity and Endothelial Function in Obese Female Mice,"Gertrude,Nermin,Kellea,Audrey,Katelyn,Volkhard,Analia,Gertrude,Nermin,Kellea,Audrey,Katelyn,Volkhard,Analia,Gertrude,Nermin,Kellea,Audrey,Katelyn,Volkhard,Analia","Soluble prorenin receptor (sPRR) is a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) identified as a plasma biomarker for human metabolic disease. However, what tissue source of sPRR is implicated in the modulation of metabolic function remains unclear. This study investigated the contribution of human sPRR (HsPRR) produced in the adipose tissue (Adi) on the metabolic and cardiovascular function of lean and obese male and female mice. Adi-HsPRR mice, generated by crossing human sPRR-Myc-tag and Adiponectin/Cre mice, were fed a low-fat or high-fat diet (10% and 60% kCal from fat, respectively) for 20 weeks. Obese Adi-HsPRR mice showed elevated sPRR levels in adipose tissue without affecting adipocyte size or fat depot weight. Despite plasma sPRR being similar between obese Adi-HsPRR and control female mice, a positive correlation between plasma sPRR and adiposity was present only in controls. Obese Adi-HsPRR male mice showed elevated plasma sPRR compared with controls, but no correlation with adiposity was found in either group. Nevertheless, Adi-HsPRR expression improved insulin sensitivity and endothelial function, reduced adipogenic genes mRNA abundance (PPARg, SEBP1C and CD36), and increased plasma Angiotensin 1-7 levels only in obese HsPPR female mice. Taken together, elevated HsPRR in adipose tissue improved metabolic and vascular function in obese female mice despite normal circulating levels of sPRR, whereas increased local and circulating levels of HsPRR did not influence metabolic and cardiovascular function in obese male mice. Our data suggest that increased plasma sPRR associated with metabolic disease could be produced by other tissues rather than adipocytes."
Understanding Neuronal Diversity: Role of Input Dynamics and Selectivity,"Nishant,Sven,Tansu,Fleur,Nishant,Sven,Tansu,Fleur,Nishant,Sven,Tansu,Fleur","The diversity of neurons in the brain is traditionally studied through morphological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic features. However, because neurons function as spatiotemporal filters of the presynaptic activity patterns, the input dynamics should contribute to neuronal diversity. We tested this hypothesis in barrel cortical neurons using a classical 'step-and-hold' input and a rich dynamical input mimicking input from a presynaptic network. We found that the stimulus type strongly determines classification. To understand this input dependence further, we systematically compared which attributes are the most informative about neuronal heterogeneity by performing classifications based on four different attribute sets that capture 1) action potential features, 2) passive biophysical features, 3) adaptation, and 4) linear input filter using the Spike Triggered Average (STA). We compared the variance explained by the shared structure across these four attribute sets. We observed that the linear input filter explains the highest amount of private variance and thus is the most informative about neuronal heterogeneity. These results demonstrate the importance of the interplay between the input dynamics and the postsynaptic neuron's linear input filter for understanding functional neuronal diversity."
The effects of conditional loss of myosin binding protein H-like on cardiac function,"Hope V.,Alex,Shreeya,Geena,David Y,Hope V.,Alex,Shreeya,Geena,David Y,Hope V.,Alex,Shreeya,Geena,David Y","Mutations in the myosin-binding protein H-like (MyBP-HL) gene, ,, are linked to hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), atrial fibrillation, and atrioventricular arrhythmias. MyBP-HL is a sarcomeric protein that is highly expressed in the atria with only scarce, distinct clusters of MyBP-HL positive cells within and surrounding the ventricular conduction system. Constitutive knock-out of MyBP-HL in mice causes atrial dilation, arrhythmia, and DCM. Whether MyBP-HL plays a developmental role, or if knock-down in adulthood will recapitulate a similar phenotype has yet to be examined. Moreover, the significance of the MyBP-HL expressing ventricular cells, or the functional need for differential thick filament regulation is currently unknown."

Tracking gonadotropin-releasing hormone-mediated movement in-vivo using quantum dot nanoparticles: insights into pathways leading to sperm release,"A.R.,A.J.,D.,J.M.,S.T.,C.K.,A.R.,A.J.,D.,J.M.,S.T.,C.K.,A.R.,A.J.,D.,J.M.,S.T.,C.K.","As the number of conservation breeding programs for at-risk amphibians increase, application of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) has likewise grown, with hormone therapy being the most widely utilized technique. Significant interest has been raised for viable alternatives to traditional intracelomic injection for hormone treatment that may be simpler, require less hormone, induce a faster response and be more suitable for animals of different sizes or for minimal contact. We utilized quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles conjugated to GnRHa (GnRHa-QDs) as a means of monitoring exogenous GnRHa dispersal through living Fowler’s toads to investigate how delivery route may affect hormone pathway and efficacy after intracelomic, nasal, and oral administration. Real-time GnRHa-QD movement was tracked using in vivo imaging while hormone binding and QD aggregation were validated using fluorescence microscopy and measurements of spermiation responses following the administration of unconjugated GnRHa, unconjugated QDs, and GnRHa-QDs GnRHa alone was found to induce spermiation in 58.3%, 76.9% and 92.3% of males when administered by intracelomic, oral and nasal routes, respectively. When given through intracelomic injection GnRHa-QD caused spermiation and dispersed throughout the abdominal cavity to then aggregate within the brain, heart, liver, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, kidneys, and testes while unconjugated QDs did not. By contrast, GnRHa-QDs administered by oral or nasal routes were observed moving to the tympanic membrane and down the throat to the GI tract of the toads, but only nasal-administered GnRHa-QDs showed organ aggregation and were only found in the kidneys. Unconjugated QDs exhibited similar in vivo signal dispersal as their conjugated counterparts initially but did not aggregate in any organs over time nor induce spermiation. Through the use of novel QD hormone conjugates, in vivo imaging, and histology we were able to gain insight into how hormone pathways and efficacy might be impacted by delivery route which result in variations in physiological response to hormone treatment."

Identification of SPP1-positive macrophages by single-cell spatial analysis in human lung tissues with mycobacterial infection,"Harutaka,Akira,Yuko,Yoshihiko,Harutaka,Akira,Yuko,Yoshihiko,Harutaka,Akira,Yuko,Yoshihiko","Tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) diseases are infections caused by , and non-tuberculous mycobacteria such as , complex, leading to the formation of granulomatous lesions with caseous necrosis in the lungs. Although granulomatous tissues are infiltrated by numerous inflammatory cells, including macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils, the mechanisms underlying granuloma formation by mycobacteria remain unclear. In this study, we performed single-cell spatial analysis on lung tissue samples from patients with tuberculosis and NTM diseases to investigate the infiltrating cell populations. We analyzed seven lung lesions and identified individual cell types infiltrating the granulomatous tissue. Based on gene expression profiles, at least four macrophage subtypes were identified. Notably, SPP1-positive macrophages predominantly infiltrated the granulomatous tissue. Langhans giant cells expressed SPP1, and many SPP1-positive macrophages without giant cell morphology were also present around the granuloma. RNA-seq analysis revealed elevated SPP1 expression in mycobacterium-infected tissues. The SPP1-CD44 signaling pathway was active in SPP1-positive macrophages and their neighboring cells in mycobacterium-infected tissues. SPP1-positive macrophages were also observed around granulomas in other granulomatous diseases, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis and sarcoidosis. These findings suggest that SPP1-positive macrophages may play a key role in granuloma formation in granulomatous diseases, including mycobacterial infections."

Previous studies have noted a decrease in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in AD patients, but the presence and impact of pathological tau isoforms in RGCs and RGC integrity, particularly in early AD stages, have not been explored. To investigate this, we examined retinal superior temporal cross-sections from 25 patients with MCI (due to AD) or AD dementia and 16 cognitively normal (CN) controls, matched for age and gender. We utilized the RGC marker ribonucleic acid binding protein with multiple splicing (RBPMS) and Nissl staining to assess neuronal density in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). Our study found that hypertrophic RGCs containing pS396-tau and T22-positive tau oligomers were more frequently observed in MCI and AD patients compared to CN subjects. Quantitative analyses indicated a decline in RGC integrity, with 46-55% and 55-56% reductions of RBPMS, RGCs (P<0.01) and Nissl, GCL neurons (P<0.01-0.001), respectively, in MCI and AD patients. This decrease in RGC count was accompanied by increases in necroptotic-like morphology and the cleaved caspase-3 apoptotic marker in RGCs of AD patients. Furthermore, there was a 2.1 to 3.1-fold increase (P<0.05-0.0001) in pS396-tau-laden RGCs in MCI and AD patients, with a greater abundance observed in individuals with higher Braak stages (V-VI), more severe clinical dementia ratings (CDR=3), and lower mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores. Strong correlations were noted between the decline in RGCs and the total amount of retinal pS396-tau and pS396-tau, RGCs, with pS396-tau, RGC counts correlating significantly with brain neurofibrillary tangle scores (,= 0.71, P= 0.0001), Braak stage (,= 0.65, P= 0.0009), and MMSE scores (,= -0.76, P= 0.0004). These findings suggest that retinal tauopathy, characterized by pS396-tau and oligomeric tau in hypertrophic RGCs, is associated with and may contribute to RGC degeneration in AD. Future research should validate these findings in larger cohorts and explore noninvasive retinal imaging techniques that target tau pathology in RGCs to improve AD detection and monitor disease progression."

Capitalizing on complement dysregulation as both a significant risk factor for AMD and the known pathophysiology of C3G, we investigated the potential for adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery of complement factor H (CFH) to rescue C3G in a , mouse model of C3G. While past efforts to treat C3G using exogenous human CFH resulted in limited success before immune rejection led to a foreign protein response, our findings demonstrate the capacity for long-term AAV-mediated delivery of truncated CFH (tCFH) to restore inhibition of the alternative pathway of complement and ultimately reverse C3G without immune rejection. Comparing results from the administration of several tCFH vectors also revealed significant differences in their relative efficiency and efficacy. These discoveries pave the way for subsequent development of AAV-mediated tCFH replacement therapy for patients with C3G, while simultaneously demonstrating proof of concept for a parallel AAV-mediated tCFH gene augmentation therapy for patients with AMD."

Feeding on multiple prey at a time:The frequency and population-dynamic effects of functional-response linearity,"Mark,Kyle Edward,John P,Mark,Kyle Edward,John P,Mark,Kyle Edward,John P","Ecologists differ in the degree to which they consider the linear Type I functional response to be an unrealistic versus sufficient representation of predator feeding rates. Empiricists tend to consider it unsuitably non-mechanistic and theoreticians tend to consider it necessarily simple. Holling's original rectilinear model is dismissed by satisfying neither desire, with most compromising on the smoothly saturating Type II response for which searching and handling are assumed to be mutually exclusive activities. We derive a ``multiple-prey-at-a-time'' functional response and a generalization that includes the Type III to reflect predators that can continue to search when handling an arbitrary number of already-captured prey.  The multi-prey model clarifies the empirical relevance of Holling's linear and rectilinear models and the conditions under which linearity can be a mechanistically-reasoned description of predator feeding rates, even when handling times are long. We find support for the presence of linearity in 35\% of 2,591 compiled empirical datasets, and find evidence that larger predator-prey body-mass ratios permit predators to search while handling greater numbers of prey. Incorporating the multi-prey response into the Rosenzweig-MacArthur population-dynamics model reveals that a non-exclusivity of searching and handling can lead to coexistence states and dynamics that are not anticipated by theory built on Holling's traditional models. In particular, it can lead to bistable fixed-point and limit-cycle dynamics with long-term crawl-by transients between them under conditions where abundance ratios reflect top-heavy food webs and the functional response is linear. We conclude that functional response linearity should not be considered empirically unrealistic but also that that more bounded conclusions should be drawn in theory presuming the Type I to be appropriate."

"First report of , in blue mussel (,): morphology, phylogeny, and host-parasite interaction","Anders,Jon,Staffan,Fabien,Anders,Jon,Staffan,Fabien,Anders,Jon,Staffan,Fabien","Bivalve diseases caused by protozoan parasitic infection are monitored by coordinated surveillance programs across European member countries. These routine monitorings of bivalve health, however, only survey a few relatively well known parasites, which may leave undetected a range of lesser known opportunistic protozoan agents. Under increased stress, for example due to shifting environmental conditions affecting water quality and nutrient access, these opportunistic parasites may develop pathogenicity impacting reproduction or growth and therefore decreasing the success and future development of aquaculture or wild population sustainability. During routine histopathological surveillance of blue mussels in Sweden, we noticed cryptic lesions in the adductor muscle in high prevalence over a period ranging from 2017 to 2022. These lesions suggested cell infiltration and degenerative changes in the muscle tissues. In this study, we report on the isolation, identification, and culture of the protistan cells likely responsible for at least some of these lesions. Using histology and cytology, molecular phylogeny, and catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH), we show that the cells correspond to the , sequence initially isolated from oysters. We also reveal the presence of , in the digestive glands and mantel, and that this parasite might be horizontally transmitted from adult to larvae via infections within gonads, ovaries.

Ecological and socioeconomic factors associated with globally reported tick-borne viruses,"Samantha,Sadie J.,Samantha,Sadie J.,Samantha,Sadie J.","Background: Public health resources are often allocated based on reported disease cases. However, for lesser-known infectious diseases, such as tick-borne viruses, disease risk reporting should account for more than just the biology of the disease and include mediating factors such as socioeconomics which can determine if an infection gets reported. Objectives: We aim to identify country-level ecological and socioeconomic factors important to reporting tick-borne viruses and examine whether countries with more economic resources have a higher likelihood of reporting resource intensive incidences. Our study goals are to determine potential country-level interventions that could enhance recognition of and reduce the health burden associated with tick-borne viruses. Methods: We apply machine learning to the most comprehensive tick-borne virus database, ZOVER, with a curated global trait matrix of 23 environmental and socioeconomic predictors. Results: We identified socioeconomic factors driving reported tick-borne viruses captured in the database at a country level. Countries that were more likely to report tick-borne viruses had a lower Gini Index (i.e., countries with less inequalities such as Nordic countries), increased dollars spent on pesticide imports, and had institutions (i.e., IVSA chapter) or individuals with agricultural, forestry, or veterinary knowledge (i.e., % of tertiary grads) present. Additional characteristics included countries with a lower percent of population exposed to conflict also had a higher probability of reporting a tick-borne virus. As expected, broad environmental factors such as the Koeppen-Geiger climate classification zone was important and identified Mediterranean climate or humid subtropical climate as environmentally suitable zones for reported tick-borne viruses. Discussion: For environmentally persistent pathogens, the role of ancillary factors mediating reporting must be considered for allocating resources to interventions. In addition, while direct interruption of transmission is important, socioeconomic interventions may be the greatest tool to reduce local disease burden."
Avian predator-prey dynamics in a changing climate along the Western Antarctic Peninsula; a scoping review,"Tamara M,Victoria R,Tamara M,Victoria R,Tamara M,Victoria R","A unique characteristic of the food web along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), one of the fastest warming regions in the world, is that the avian tertiary predators seasonally rely on avian secondary predators for their subsistence. We conducted a scoping review to 1.) provide a summary of research on Antarctic avian predator-prey relationships, 2.) investigate potential avian predator-prey relationships and trends with the environment, and 3.) highlight research gaps and provide recommendations for future research. We searched Web of Science and Google Scholar for publications in English during any years. For our first aim, we searched using the terms ""predator-prey dynamics"" AND ""Antarctica."" We excluded results that did not include both avian predators and prey, which resulted in eight publications from around the Southern Ocean, and one along the WAP. For our second aim, we searched using the terms of each species' common and scientific names (gentoo penguin, Pygoscelis papua, Adelie penguin, P. adeliae, chinstrap penguin, P. antarcticus, southern giant petrel, Macronectes giganteus, south polar skua, Stercorarius maccormicki, brown skua, S. antarcticus) AND ""population"" AND ""Antarctic Peninsula."" We refined our results (N=59) to publications with data on at least one prey and one predator avian species of all papers found in Web of Science, and the first 100 records of Google Scholar. We selected five locations that had data spanning over 10 years and that spread across the northern WAP. We compared predator-prey species trends across time along with sea surface and air temperature. We found that predator-prey dynamics between avian secondary and tertiary predators have had limited investigations in Antarctica. Along the WAP, the relationship between different penguin species and avian tertiary predators are highly variable and many population trends are decoupled from local temperature change. We include recommendations for future data collection and research on these interactions."
Investigating Honey Bee Pollen Foraging Patterns Across a Season Using DNA Metabarcoding,"Sydney N,Joshua G,Heather M,Sydney N,Joshua G,Heather M,Sydney N,Joshua G,Heather M","The western honey bee, or Apis mellifera, is a vital pollinator, essential for both ecosystems and agriculture worldwide. As human influences on these bees become more pronounced, understanding their pollen foraging behavior is increasingly important. Pollen provides crucial nutrients for A. mellifera such as protein and lipids that are necessary for hive health and prosperity. Pollen DNA metabarcoding allows for the longitudinal analysis of the floral sources of corbicular (bee-collected) pollen. In this study we employ the use of metabarcoding and Oxford Nanopore Sequencing technology to analyze the floral composition of pollen samples collected on a weekly basis from two closely related hives. In total, we identified 74 distinct plant taxa (at the genus level) between the two hives. Although both hives had equivalent values of taxonomic richness and diversity, the majority of taxa identified were unique to the individual hives. This indicates a large degree of variation in pollen foraging despite the hives' relative proximity. In addition to this interhive analysis, we also analyzed changes in pollen origin of a single hive across the course of five months. We identified 59 distinct plant taxa within samples from this hive whose presence and relative abundance differ drastically on a weekly basis with no taxa being present in all samples across the observed time period. In addition, even though there was a median of 8 to 9 taxa detected in each sample, each sample was composed primarily of 1 to 2 taxa indicating a degree of foraging preference that changes on a regular basis. Further quantitative and qualitative comparisons completed in this study demonstrate the degree of variation in pollen foraging patterns both throughout the season and between hives."

Brandon","The Florida Mottled Duck (Anas fulvigula fulvigula) is a unique subspecies of waterfowl whose range is limited to peninsular Florida, USA. As an endemic species, Florida Mottled Ducks face numerous conservation stressors, such as habitat conversion and hybridization with non-native Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). In addition to these numerous stressors, Mottled Ducks are also contending with emerging and/or geographically expanding waterborne pathogens such as Vibrio spp., due to the effects of climate change. However, even given their conservation needs, little is known with respect to the health, physiology and the immunity of wild Mottled Ducks in Florida. Given this lack of data, we performed health assessments of Mottled Ducks in the Central Florida area. Specifically, we examined the humoral innate immune system, i.e., plasma, of Mottled Ducks in response to a common, but extraneous pathogen, Escherichia coli strain ATCC number 8739. We utilized a bactericidal assay (BKA) commonly used in eco-immunology, to provide insight into the bactericidal capacities of captured Florida Mottled Ducks. We statistically tested the BKA capacity of 23 Mottled Ducks in response to age and whole blood lead levels (Pb). We found that there was no statistically significant relationship between the covariates we measured and Mottled Duck BKA capacity against E. coli. However, the variability we observed in the BKA capacity of this subspecies warrants further research into additional physiological and ecological covariates coupled with potential immune stressors that Florida Mottled Ducks may be contending with."
Invasive mammals disrupt native dung beetle community coexistence,"Ryo,Ryo,Shinji,Ryo,Ryo,Shinji,Ryo,Ryo,Shinji","Biological invasions are among the major drivers of biodiversity and are increasing worldwide. Among the invasive species, mammals have a particularly profound impact on native ecosystems. As primary decomposers of mammalian feces, dung beetles are critical in ecosystem functioning, and their community structure is closely linked to their services. However, the introduction of invasive mammals threatens these beetles and potentially disrupts their ecosystem services. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the resulting changes in communities. We developed a novel population dynamics model focusing on the interactions among mammals, feces, and dung beetles. Our results indicate that such invasions increase the risk of extinction of specialist dung beetles that cannot utilize the feces of invasive mammals. The risk of extinction is particularly high when generalist dung beetles show a preference for native feces, leading to intensified interspecific competition for resources. Additionally,  the extinction risk of specialist dung beetles increases when invasive mammals display irruptive population dynamics. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that non-native mammalian invasions disrupt the coexistence of native dung beetle communities, potentially leading to losses in biodiversity and ecosystem function. These risks should be considered in future empirical studies to evaluate the impact of invasive mammals on dung beetle communities."

However, biogeographical studies often lack information about the origin of introduced populations, limiting our understanding of post-introduction evolution of introduced species in the new range. Here, we assessed the responses of Reynoutria japonica from 128 populations spanning three latitudinal transects in the native ranges of China and Japan, and the introduced ranges of North America and Europe. When grown in two common gardens in the native range, plants from introduced populations in North America and Europe differed in almost all traits from those from native Chinese populations, but were similar to plants from native Japanese populations. Compared to Chinese populations, North American, European and Japanese populations expressed lower trait values and plasticity in most traits. However, plants from both introduced ranges and from Japanese populations expressed higher clonality and plasticity in clonality than plants from Chinese populations. In addition, introduced populations expressed higher plasticity in clonality but lower plasticity in basal diameter compared to Japanese populations. Our study showed heritable differences in phenotypes between plants from the native ranges of Japan and China, and those from the introduced ranges were similar to the putative source of origin in Japan. However, we found that introduced populations may have evolved higher plasticity in clonal growth. Our findings emphasize the critical role of clonality and plasticity in invasion success, demonstrating the importance of discriminating between source and non-source native populations to identify ecological and evolutionary responses of invasive plants to novel environments."
One size does not fit all: a novel approach for determining the Realised Viewshed Size for remote camera traps,"Brendan M,Tal,Garrett M,Sean P,Eric,Brendan M,Tal,Garrett M,Sean P,Eric,Brendan M,Tal,Garrett M,Sean P,Eric","Camera traps (CTs) have become cemented as an important tool of wildlife research, yet, their utility is now extending beyond academics, as CTs can contribute to more inclusive place-based wildlife management. From advances in analytics and technology, CT-based density estimates of wildlife is an emerging field of research. Most CT-based density methods require an estimate of the size of the viewshed monitored by each CT, a parameter that may be highly variable and difficult to quantify. Here, we developed and tested a standardized field and analytical method allowing us to predict the probability of photographic capture as it varies within CT viewshed. We investigated how capture probability changes due to environmental influences, i.e., vegetation structure, ambient temperature, speed of subject, time of day, in addition to internal factors from CTs themselves, i.e., sensitivity settings, number of photos taken, and CT brand. We then summarize these spatial capture probability kernels into a Realised Viewshed Size (RVS)-the capture-probability corrected size of a CTs viewshed. We found that RVS values are heavily influenced by location-specific environmental factors, i.e., vegetation structure, technological delays associated with CTs themselves, i.e., refractory period, and internal CT settings, i.e., sensitivity, number of photographs taken. We also found that the RVS values computed using our methodology are substantially smaller than reported values in the literature. Imprecision surrounding CT viewshed areas can create propagating bias when implementing CT-based density estimators. Our method can change how practitioners consider photographs for use in CT density estimators thus increasing the reliability of CT-based density estimation, and contribute to more accessible wildlife management practices."

Rai,Lise,Laurel,Naomi,Charles,Robert A.,Andrew F.,Lee-Way,Brittany N.,Michael J.","Accumulation of abnormal tau protein into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is a pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). Accurate detection of NFTs in tissue samples can reveal relationships with clinical, demographic, and genetic features through deep phenotyping. However, expert manual analysis is time-consuming, subject to observer variability, and cannot handle the data amounts generated by modern imaging. We present a scalable, open-source, deep-learning approach to quantify NFT burden in digital whole slide images (WSIs) of post-mortem human brain tissue. To achieve this, we developed a method to generate detailed NFT boundaries directly from single-point-per-NFT annotations. We then trained a semantic segmentation model on 45 annotated 2400µm by 1200µm regions of interest (ROIs) selected from 15 unique temporal cortex WSIs of AD cases from three institutions (University of California (UC)-Davis, UC-San Diego, and Columbia University). Segmenting NFTs at the single-pixel level, the model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.832 and an F1 of 0.527 (196-fold over random) on a held-out test set of 664 NFTs from 20 ROIs (7 WSIs). We compared this to deep object detection, which achieved comparable but coarser-grained performance that was 60% faster. The segmentation and object detection models correlated well with expert semi-quantitative scores at the whole-slide level (Spearman’s rho ρ=0.654 (p=6.50e-5) and ρ=0.513 (p=3.18e-3), respectively). We openly release this multi-institution deep-learning pipeline to provide detailed NFT spatial distribution and morphology analysis capability at a scale otherwise infeasible by manual assessment."

To ground the simulation in true human interaction patterns, a three-day citizen science experiment was conducted during which the pairwise distances between 469 volunteers in Haslemere were tracked continuously using a mobile phone app. Here, we offer a scientific companion to the documentary in which we describe the methods behind our simulation and release the pairwise interpersonal distance dataset. We discuss salient features of the dataset, including daily patterns in the clustering and volatility of interpersonal interactions. Our epidemiological analysis of the simulated Haslemere outbreak serves as a springboard to discuss scientific opportunities opened by the Haslemere dataset and others like it. We believe that the Haslemere dataset will productively challenge current strategies for incorporating population structure into disease transmission models, and hope that it will inspire the collection and analysis of other similar datasets in the future."

 two-photon FLIM resolves photosynthetic properties of maize bundle sheath cells,"Zhufeng,Jing,Baichen,Lijin,Zhufeng,Jing,Baichen,Lijin,Zhufeng,Jing,Baichen,Lijin","Maize (, L.) performs highly efficient C, photosynthesis by dividing photosynthetic metabolism between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. , physiological measurements are indispensable for C, photosynthesis research as any isolated cells or sectioned leaf often show interrupted and abnormal photosynthetic activities. Yet, direct , observation regarding bundle sheath cells in the delicate anatomy of the C, leaf is still challenging. In the current work, we used two-photon fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (two-photon-FLIM) to access the photosynthetic properties of bundle sheath cells on intact maize leaves. The results provide spectroscopic evidence for the diminished total PSII activity in bundle sheath cells at its physiological level and show that the single PSIIs could undergo charge separation as causal. We also report an acetic acid-induced chlorophyll fluorescence quenching on intact maize leaves, which might be a physiological state related to the nonphotochemical quenching mechanism."

Biotic interactions and environmental filtering both determine earthworm alpha and beta diversity in tropical rainforests,"Arnaud,Mickael,Pierre,Emmanuel,Marie-Eugenie,Eric,Thibaud,Arnaud,Mickael,Pierre,Emmanuel,Marie-Eugenie,Eric,Thibaud,Arnaud,Mickael,Pierre,Emmanuel,Marie-Eugenie,Eric,Thibaud","Understanding the relative importance of biotic interactions, multiple environmental drivers, and neutral processes in shaping community diversity and composition is a central question for both theoretical and applied ecology. We analysed a dataset describing 125 earthworm communities sampled in 10 localities in French Guiana. DNA barcodes were used to delimit operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that we considered as species surrogates to avoid the taxonomic deficit and calculate community-scale species richness and pair-wise Sorensen beta-diversity. We used log-ratio and generalised linear models to highlight the effects of biotic interactions and environment as drivers of alpha diversity, and generalised dissimilarity models to figure out the relative contribution of space and environment to beta-diversity at different spatial extents. Community-scale alpha diversity was mainly explained by habitat filtering (soil texture) and interspecific competition that limit the number of locally co-existing species. Beta diversity between pairs of communities was mainly explained by distance when comparing communities in similar habitats, by topography and available soil phosphorus when comparing communities in different habitats, and by distance, elevation and climate when comparing all possible pairs of communities. While community composition is determined locally by neutral processes and environmental filtering, biogeographic processes linked to dispersal limitation and adaptation to local environment are the most influential on a regional scale. This highlights the complex interplay of dispersal limitation, biotic interactions and environmental filtering during the process of community assembly."

The role of “spillover” in antibiotic resistance,"Scott W.,Marc,Yonatan H.,Scott W.,Marc,Yonatan H.,Scott W.,Marc,Yonatan H.","Antibiotic use is a key driver of antibiotic resistance. Understanding the quantitative association between antibiotic use and resulting resistance is important for predicting future rates of antibiotic resistance and for designing antibiotic stewardship policy. However, the use-resistance association is complicated by “spillover”, in which one population’s level of antibiotic use affects another population’s level of resistance via the transmission of bacteria between those populations. Spillover is known to have effects at the level of families and hospitals, but it is unclear if spillover is relevant at larger scales. We used mathematical modeling and analysis of observational data to address this question. First, we used dynamical models of antibiotic resistance to predict the effects of spillover. Whereas populations completely isolated from one another do not experience any spillover, we found that if even 1% of interactions are between populations, then spillover may have large consequences: the effect of a change in antibiotic use in one population on antibiotic resistance in that population could be reduced by as much as 50%. Then, we quantified spillover in observational antibiotic use and resistance data from US states and European countries for 3 pathogen-antibiotic combinations, finding that increased interactions between populations were associated with smaller differences in antibiotic resistance between those populations. Thus, spillover may have an important impact at the level of states and countries, which has ramifications for predicting the future of antibiotic resistance, designing antibiotic resistance stewardship policy, and interpreting stewardship interventions."

Social fluidity mobilizes contagion in human and animal populations,"Ewan,Vittoria,Ephraim M.,David P.,Shweta,Ewan,Vittoria,Ephraim M.,David P.,Shweta,Ewan,Vittoria,Ephraim M.,David P.,Shweta","Humans and other group-living animals tend to distribute their social effort disproportionately. Individuals predominantly interact with a small number of close companions while maintaining weaker social bonds with less familiar group members. By incorporating this behaviour into a mathematical model we find that a single parameter, which we refer to as social fluidity, controls the rate of social mixing within the group. We compare the social fluidity of 13 species by applying the model to empirical human and animal social interaction data. To investigate how social behavior influences the likelihood of an epidemic outbreak we derive an analytical expression of the relationship between social fluidity and the basic reproductive number of an infectious disease. For highly fluid social behaviour disease transmission is revealed to be density-dependent. For species that form more stable social bonds, the model describes frequency-dependent transmission that is sensitive to changes in social fluidity."
Protein Kinases in Phagocytosis: Promising Genetic Biomarkers for Cancer,"Sadhika,Hengrui,Sadhika,Hengrui,Sadhika,Hengrui","Cancer is a complex disease characterized by genetic and molecular diversity, often involving dysregulation of critical cellular pathways. Recent advances in pan-cancer research have highlighted the importance of shared oncogenic mechanisms across different cancer types, providing new avenues for therapeutic exploration. Protein kinases, particularly those involved in phagocytosis, play pivotal roles in cellular homeostasis and immune response. This study systematically examines the genetic alterations and expression profiles of protein kinases associated with phagocytosis across various cancer types, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other publicly available resources. We analyzed single nucleotide variations (SNVs), copy number variations (CNVs), methylation patterns, and mRNA expression to identify recurring alterations and their associations with survival outcomes. Our findings reveal that MET and MERTK are the most frequently mutated genes, with missense mutations dominating across cancers. CNV analysis shows significant correlations with survival in cancers like UCEC, KIRP, and KIRC, while methylation analysis indicates cancer-specific regulatory patterns affecting gene expression. Differential expression analysis highlights distinct cancer-type-specific expression profiles, with genes like MET and BTK displaying significant variation. Crosstalk pathway analysis further reveals the involvement of these kinases in key cancer-related pathways, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and apoptosis. Drug sensitivity analysis identifies potential therapeutic targets, with gene expression correlating significantly with cancer cell line responsiveness to specific compounds. These findings underscore the importance of the phagocytotic kinome in cancer biology and suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting protein kinases to enhance immune response and improve treatment outcomes."
"Genomic prediction of heterosis, inbreeding control, and mate allocation in outbred diploid and tetraploid populations","Jeffrey B.,Jeffrey B.,Jeffrey B.","Breeders have long appreciated the need to balance selection for short-term genetic gain with maintaining genetic variance for long-term gain. For outbred populations, the method called Optimum Contribution Selection (OCS) chooses parental contributions to maximize the average breeding value at a prescribed inbreeding rate. With Optimum Mate Allocation (OMA), the contribution of each mating is optimized, which allows for specific combining ability due to dominance. To enable OCS and OMA in polyploid species, new theoretical results were derived to (1) predict mid-parent heterosis due to dominance and (2) control inbreeding in a population of arbitrary ploidy. A new Convex optimization framework for OMA, named COMA, was developed and released as public software. Under stochastic simulation of a genomic selection program, COMA maintained a target inbreeding rate of 0.5% using either pedigree or genomic IBD kinship. Significantly more genetic gain was realized with pedigree kinship, which is consistent with previous studies showing the selective advantage of an individual under OCS is dominated by its Mendelian sampling term. Despite the higher accuracy (+0.2–0.3) when predicting mate performance with OMA compared to OCS, there was little long-term gain advantage. The sparsity of the COMA mating design and flexibility to incorporate mating constraints offer practical incentives over OCS. In a potato breeding case study with 170 candidates, the optimal solution at 0.5% inbreeding involved 43 parents but only 43 of the 903 possible matings."
A collection of split-Gal4 drivers targeting conserved signaling ligands in ,"Ben,Neha,Ashley Suraj,Tanuj,Jonathan,Norbert,Ben,Neha,Ashley Suraj,Tanuj,Jonathan,Norbert,Ben,Neha,Ashley Suraj,Tanuj,Jonathan,Norbert","Communication between cells in metazoan organisms is mediated by a remarkably small number of highly conserved signaling pathways. Given the relatively small number of signaling pathways, the existence of multiple related ligands for many of these pathways is thought to represent a key evolutionary innovation for encoding complexity into cell-cell signaling. Relatedly, crosstalk and other interactions between pathways is another critical feature which allows a modest number pathways to ultimately generate an enormously diverse range of outcomes. It would thus be useful to have genetic tools to identify and manipulate not only those cells which express a given signaling ligand, but also those cells that specifically co-express pairs of signaling ligands. Here, we present a collection of split-Gal4 knock-in lines targeting many of the ligands for highly conserved signaling pathways in , (Notch, Hedgehog, FGF, EGF, TGF,, JAK/STAT, JNK, and PVR). We demonstrate that these lines faithfully recapitulate the endogenous expression pattern of their targets, and that they can be used to specifically identify the cells and tissues that co-express pairs of signaling ligands. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that the 4th chromosome TGF, ligands , and , are broadly co-expressed in muscles and other tissues of both larva and adults, and that the JAK/STAT ligands , and , are partially co-expressed from cells of the midgut following gut damage. Together with our previously collection of split-Gal4 lines targeting the seven Wnt ligands, this resource allows , researchers to identify and genetically manipulate cells that specifically express pairs of conserved ligands from nearly all the major intercellular signaling pathways."

The 545 expression-modulating variants (emVars) identified greatly enrich for likely causal variants. We provide evidence that many emVars are mediated by common upstream regulatory conduits, and that putative target genes of primary T cell emVars are highly enriched within a lymphocyte activation network. Using bulk and single-cell CRISPR-interference screens, we confirm that emVar-containing T cell ,-regulatory elements modulate both known and novel target genes that regulate T cell proliferation, providing plausible mechanisms by which these variants alter autoimmune disease risk."

Here, the results from more than 23 laboratories are presented. The primary purpose was to design experiments simulating typical casework circumstances; collect data and to implement Bayesian networks to assess the value (i.e., likelihood ratio) of DNA results given activity level propositions. Two different experimental designs were used to simulate a robbery, where a screwdriver was used to force a door or window. Propositions and case information were chosen following laboratory feedback listing typical casework circumstances (included in the paper). Whereas the proposition representing prosecution’s view is applicable to many cases: the defendant forced the door/window with his screwdriver; the proposition representing defence’s view are more variable depending on what is alleged to have happened. In a direct transfer experiment, the defendant owned and used the screwdriver, but he did not force the door/window in question. An unknown person used the defendant’s stolen screwdriver. In an indirect transfer experiment, the defendant neither owned, saw, nor used the screwdriver, nor did they force the door or window. Instead, an unknown individual—someone with whom the defendant had interacted (e.g., by shaking hands or touching the same objects)—used the recovered tool to force entry. In the first experiment, if the defendant forced the door/window, then s/he is the last handler of the screw driver, whereas if the tool was stolen and used by an unknown person, the defendant is the first handler. For the second experiment, given the defence view, the defendant never held the screwdriver. We envisaged the situation where an object manipulated by the defendant (or the defendant himself/herself) would be touched by the unknown offender who would then force the window. The time delay between the touching of the object and the forcing of the window was 0, 1h, and 2h. This was accomplished by handshaking experiments, where the person forcing the door would shake a person’s hand, and then use the screwdriver either immediately after handshake or after 1, 2 hours. It was found for the direct transfer experiment that unless a single contributor profile aligning with the known person’s of interest profile was retrieved, the results did not allow to discriminate propositions. On the other hand, for the indirect transfer experiment, both single and major contributor profiles that aligned with the person of interest (POI) supported the proposition that the person used the tool rather than an unknown person who had touched an object, when indeed the former was true. There was considerable variation in median recoveries of DNA between laboratories (between 200pg - 5ng) for a given experiment if quantities are taken into account. These differences affect the likelihood ratios given activity level propositions. More than 2,700 samples were analysed in the course of this study. Two different Bayesian Networks are made available via an open source application written in Shiny R: Shiny_React(). For comparison, all datasets were analysed using a qualitative method categorised into absent, single, balanced or major given contributors."
"Allele-specific silencing of a dominant , mutation in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 4","Audrey,Athena,Brian,George,Dongjun,Vivian,Christopher,Audrey,Athena,Brian,George,Dongjun,Vivian,Christopher,Audrey,Athena,Brian,George,Dongjun,Vivian,Christopher","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 4 (ALS4) is an autosomal dominant motor neuron disease that is molecularly characterized by reduced R-loop levels and caused by pathogenic variants in , (,). , encodes an RNA/DNA helicase that resolves three-stranded nucleic acid structures called R-loops. Currently, there are no disease-modifying therapies available for ALS4. Given that , is haplosufficient, removing the product of the mutated allele presents a potential therapeutic strategy. We designed a series of siRNAs to selectively target the RNA transcript from the ALS4 allele containing the c.1166T>C mutation (p.Leu389Ser). Transfection of HEK293 cells with siRNA and plasmids encoding either wild-type or mutant (Leu389Ser) epitope tagged SETX revealed that three siRNAs specifically reduced mutant SETX protein levels without affecting the wild-type SETX protein. In ALS4 primary fibroblasts, siRNA treatment silenced the endogenous mutant , allele, while sparing the wild-type allele, and restored R-loop levels in patient cells. Our findings demonstrate that mutant ,, differing from wild-type by a single nucleotide, can be effectively and specifically silenced by RNA interference, highlighting the potential of allele-specific siRNA as a therapeutic approach for ALS4."

We find an abundance of sex differences in expression (sex-DE) in the prenatal brain, driven by both hormonal and sex-chromosomal factors, and considerable consistency in the sex effects between the developing and adult brain, with little sex-DE exclusive to the adult forebrain. Sex-DE was not enriched in genes associated with brain disorder, consistent with systematic differences in the characteristics of these genes (e.g. constraint). Yet, the genes with persistent sex-DE across lifespan were overrepresented in disease gene co-regulation networks, pointing to their potential to mediate sex biases in brain phenotypes. Altogether, our work highlights the prenatal development as a crucial timepoint for the establishment of brain sex differences."

Identification of key genes and enriched biological processes in diabetes-associated traumatic brain injury through weighted gene correlation network and bioinformatics analysis,"Umar Faruk,Ibrahim,Umar Faruk,Ibrahim,Umar Faruk,Ibrahim","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with long-term neurological and psychological impacts. Recent studies have indicated that diabetes (T1DM) exacerbates the outcomes of TBI, leading to more severe cognitive deficits and increased risk of complications. This study investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for T1DM-associated TBI. Four mRNA datasets (GSE4745, GSE125451, GSE173975, and GSE80174) downloaded from GEO repository were used in this study. Using limma, a total of 284 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in T1DM, of which 11 were upregulated and 9 were downregulated. GSEA showed that these DEGs were significantly enriched in cell communication, lipid  metabolic process, and PPAR signaling. A total of 584 DEGs were identified in TBI, of which 186 were upregulated and 9 were downregulated. GSEA showed that these DEGs were mainly enriched in immune response-regulating signaling pathway. WGCNA identified 122 significant genes in TIDM-related modules and 368 significant genes in TBI-related module. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that T1DM module genes were significantly correlated with lipid metabolic process and ribosome biogenesis, while TBI module genes were significantly correlated with inflammation and immune response, including leukocyte mediated immunity,  lymphocyte mediated immunity, and cytokine mediated receptor activity. PPI network analysis of T1DM module genes identified 20 hub genes, including 14 ribosomal genes: Rpl23, Rps3a, Rps6, Rpl5, Rpl17, Rps24, Rpl23a, Rps4x, Rpl9, Rps15a14, Rpl30, Rpl31, Rps25, and Rps27a-2. The hub genes were primarily related to ribosome biogenesis and RNA post-transcriptional regulation. PPI network analysis of TBI module genes identified 20 hub genes: Ptprc, Tp53, Stat1, Stat3, Tyrobp, Itgad, Csf1r, Itgb2, Rac2, Icam1, Myd88, Cd44, Vav1, Aif1, C1qa, Laptm5, B2m, Fcer1g, and Lyn. The hub genes were primarily related to inflammatory mediators and immune response. Based on the overlap of T1DM module genes and TBI module genes, Cmklr1, Mgst1, and Plin2, were identified as key genes of T1DM-associated TBI. Functional enrichment analysis showed that they were primarily enriched in the cellular response to hydroperoxide, cytokine-mediated receptor signaling activity, regulation of sequestering of triglyceride, negative regulation of IL-12 production, and positive regulation of macrophage chemotaxis. Using Reactome, Cmklr1, Mgst1, and Plin2 were related to cytokine signaling activity, neutrophil degranulation, and lipid storage, respectively. We concluded that Lipid droplet dysregulation and Neuroinflammation are the potential molecular mechanisms of T1DM-associated TBI. Cmklr1, Mgst1, and Plin2 are positively correlated with T1DM-associated TBI and may be important biomarkers and potential treatment targets for diabetic TBI."

We identified a premature stop codon in the gene , (,), which is associated with the axanthic phenotype. GCH2 catalyzes the first rate-limiting step in riboflavin biosynthesis. This study provides the first identification of an axanthism-associated gene in vertebrates and highlights the utility of ball pythons as a model to study pterin-based pigmentation."
HIV Coreceptors Related Genes (CCR5 and CXCR4) Promoter Methylation: Original Research,"Anna,Svetlana,Michael,Darya,Alina,Kirill,Arina,Anastasiya,Vasily,Anna,Svetlana,Michael,Darya,Alina,Kirill,Arina,Anastasiya,Vasily,Anna,Svetlana,Michael,Darya,Alina,Kirill,Arina,Anastasiya,Vasily","The persistence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) within viral reservoirs poses significant challenges to eradication efforts. Epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation, are potential factors influencing HIV latency and persistence. This study details the development and application of techniques to assess CpG methylation in the promoter regions of the , and , genes, key HIV-1 coreceptors. Using both Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing methods, we examined 51 biological samples from 17 HIV-1-infected individuals at three time points: baseline (Week 0) and post-antiretroviral therapy (ART) at Weeks 24 and 48.Our results revealed that , promoter CpG sites were largely unmethylated, while , promoter CpGs exhibited significant variability in methylation levels. Specifically, , CpG 1 showed a significant increase in methylation from Week 0 to Week 48, while , CpG 3 displayed a significant decrease between Week 0 and Week 24. These differences were statistically significant when compared with non-HIV-infected controls. These findings demonstrate distinct methylation patterns between , and , promoters in HIV-1 individuals over time, suggesting that epigenetic modifications may play a role in regulating HIV-1 persistence. Our techniques provide a reliable framework for assessing gene promoter methylation and could be applied to further research in HIV epigenetics."
Aberrant expression prediction across human tissues,"Florian R.,Jonas,Georgios,Nils,Francesco Paolo,Vicente A.,Julien,Florian R.,Jonas,Georgios,Nils,Francesco Paolo,Vicente A.,Julien,Florian R.,Jonas,Georgios,Nils,Francesco Paolo,Vicente A.,Julien","Despite the frequent implication of aberrant gene expression in diseases, algorithms predicting aberrantly expressed genes of an individual are lacking. To address this need, we compiled an aberrant expression prediction benchmark covering 8.2 million rare variants from 633 individuals across 49 tissues. While not geared toward aberrant expression, the deleteriousness score CADD and the loss-of-function predictor LOFTEE showed mild predictive ability (1-1.6% average precision). Leveraging these and further variant annotations, we next trained AbExp, a model that yielded 12% average precision by combining in a tissue-specific fashion expression variability with variant effects on isoforms and on aberrant splicing. Integrating expression measurements from clinically accessible tissues led to another two-fold improvement. Furthermore, we show on UK Biobank blood traits that performing rare variant association testing using the continuous and tissue-specific AbExp variant scores instead of LOFTEE variant burden increases gene discovery sensitivity and enables improved phenotype predictions."
Single-cell eQTL mapping in yeast reveals a tradeoff between growth and reproduction,"James,Noah,Leslie Alamo,Laura,Chetan,Joshua S,Leonid,James,Noah,Leslie Alamo,Laura,Chetan,Joshua S,Leonid,James,Noah,Leslie Alamo,Laura,Chetan,Joshua S,Leonid","Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) provide a key bridge between noncoding DNA sequence variants and organismal traits. The effects of eQTLs can differ among tissues, cell types, and cellular states, but these differences are obscured by gene expression measurements in bulk populations. We developed a one-pot approach to map eQTLs in , by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and applied it to over 100,000 single cells from three crosses. We used scRNA-seq data to genotype each cell, measure gene expression, and classify the cells by cell-cycle stage. We mapped thousands of local and distant eQTLs and identified interactions between eQTL effects and cell-cycle stages. We took advantage of single-cell expression information to identify hundreds of genes with allele-specific effects on expression noise. We used cell-cycle stage classification to map 20 loci that influence cell-cycle progression. One of these loci influenced the expression of genes involved in the mating response. We showed that the effects of this locus arise from a common variant (W82R) in the gene ,, which encodes a signaling protein that negatively regulates the mating pathway. The 82R allele increases mating efficiency at the cost of slower cell-cycle progression and is associated with a higher rate of outcrossing in nature. Our results provide a more granular picture of the effects of genetic variants on gene expression and downstream traits."
Comprehensive deletion scan of anti-CRISPR AcrIIA4 reveals essential and dispensable domains for Cas9 inhibition,"Annette B,Cory A,Simone M,Meru J,Annette B,Cory A,Simone M,Meru J,Annette B,Cory A,Simone M,Meru J","Delineating a protein’s essential and dispensable domains provides critical insight into how it carries out its function. Here, we developed a high-throughput method to synthesize and test the functionality of all possible in-frame and continuous deletions in a gene of interest, enabling rapid and unbiased determination of protein domain importance. Our approach generates precise deletions using a CRISPR library framework that is free from constraints of gRNA target site availability and efficacy. We applied our method to AcrIIA4, a phage-encoded anti-CRISPR protein that robustly inhibits SpCas9. Extensive structural characterization has shown that AcrIIA4 physically occupies the DNA-binding interfaces of several SpCas9 domains; nonetheless, the importance of each AcrIIA4 interaction for SpCas9 inhibition is unknown. We used our approach to determine the essential and dispensable regions of AcrIIA4. Surprisingly, not all contacts with SpCas9 were required, and in particular, we found that the AcrIIA4 loop that inserts into SpCas9’s RuvC catalytic domain can be deleted. Our results show that AcrIIA4 inhibits SpCas9 primarily by blocking PAM binding, and that its interaction with the SpCas9 catalytic domain is inessential."

Identification of novel genes responsible for a pollen killer present in local natural populations of ,"Anthony,Matthieu,Rémi,Marianne,Fabrice,Françoise,Christine,Anthony,Matthieu,Rémi,Marianne,Fabrice,Françoise,Christine,Anthony,Matthieu,Rémi,Marianne,Fabrice,Françoise,Christine","Gamete killers are genetic loci that distort segregation in the progeny of hybrids because the killer allele promotes the elimination of the gametes that carry the sensitive allele. They are widely distributed in eukaryotes and are important for understanding genome evolution and speciation. We had previously identified a pollen killer in hybrids between two distant natural accessions of ,. This pollen killer involves three genetically linked genes, and we previously reported the identification of the gene encoding the antidote that protects pollen grains from the killer activity. In this study, we identified the two other genes of the pollen killer by using CRISPR-Cas9 induced mutants. These two genes are necessary for the killer activity that we demonstrated to be specific to pollen. The cellular localization of the pollen killer encoded proteins indicates that the pollen killer activity involves the mitochondria. Sequence analyses reveal predicted domains from the same families in the killer proteins. In addition, the C-terminal half of one of the killer proteins is identical to the antidote, and one amino acid, crucial for the antidote activity, is also essential for the killer function. Investigating more than 700 worldwide accessions of ,, we confirmed that the locus is subject to important structural rearrangements and copy number variation. By exploiting available , genomic sequences, we propose a scenario for the emergence of this pollen killer in ,. Furthermore, we report the co-occurrence and behavior of killer and sensitive genotypes in several local populations, a prerequisite for studying gamete killer evolution in the wild. This highlights the potential of the Arabidopsis model not only for functional studies of gamete killers but also for investigating their evolutionary trajectories at complementary geographical scales."
Decoding sequence determinants of gene expression in diverse cellular and disease states,"Avantika,Alexander,Laura,David,Surag,Alex M,M Grace,Jenna L,Nathaniel,Tommaso,Hector,Gabriele,Gokcen,Avantika,Alexander,Laura,David,Surag,Alex M,M Grace,Jenna L,Nathaniel,Tommaso,Hector,Gabriele,Gokcen,Avantika,Alexander,Laura,David,Surag,Alex M,M Grace,Jenna L,Nathaniel,Tommaso,Hector,Gabriele,Gokcen","Sequence-to-function models that predict gene expression from genomic DNA sequence have proven valuable for many biological tasks, including understanding cis-regulatory syntax and interpreting non-coding genetic variants. However, current state-of-the-art models have been trained largely on bulk expression profiles from healthy tissues or cell lines, and have not learned the properties of precise cell types and states that are captured in large-scale single-cell transcriptomic datasets. Thus, they lack the ability to perform these tasks at the resolution of specific cell types or states across diverse tissue and disease contexts. To address this gap, we present Decima, a model that predicts the cell type- and condition- specific expression of a gene from its surrounding DNA sequence. Decima is trained on single-cell or single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from over 22 million cells, and successfully predicts the cell type-specific expression of unseen genes based on their sequence alone. Here, we demonstrate Decima's ability to reveal the cis-regulatory mechanisms driving cell type-specific gene expression and its changes in disease, to predict non-coding variant effects at cell type resolution, and to design regulatory DNA elements with precisely tuned, context-specific functions."

Brad","Persistent HIV reservoirs in CD4+ T-cells pose a barrier to curing HIV infection. We identified overexpression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells that survive cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) exposure, suggesting a mechanism of CTL resistance. Inhibition of EZH2 with the FDA-approved drug tazemetostat increased surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) on CD4+ T-cells, counterbalancing HIV Nef-mediated MHC-I downregulation. This improved CTL-mediated elimination of HIV-infected cells and suppressed viral replication in vitro. In a participant-derived xenograft mouse model, tazemetostat elevated MHC-I and the pro-apoptotic protein BIM in CD4+ T-cells, facilitating CD8+ T-cell-mediated reductions of HIV reservoir seeding. Additionally, tazemetostat promoted sustained skewing of CD8+ T-cells toward less differentiated and exhausted phenotypes. Our findings reveal EZH2 overexpression as a novel mechanism of CTL resistance and support the clinical evaluation of tazemetostat to enhance clearance of HIV reservoirs and improve CD8+ T-cell function."

Cholesterol sulfate (CS) is a bioactive metabolite that inhibits leukocyte migration and activation. This study investigated the roles and cells associated with CS in pregnant mice and humans. CS was sequentially produced by maternal-derived endometrial cells and fetal-derived placental trophoblasts before and after placentation. When mated with allogeneic males, CS-deficient mice showed increased fetal resorption rates under induced placental inflammation. This phenotype disappeared when the activity of the CS-producing enzyme was restored in the placenta. Placental CS levels were reduced in patients with ""villitis of unknown etiology."" Thus, we uncovered the spatiotemporal control of CS production and its relevance to local immunosuppression during pregnancy."

We have taken a pragmatic approach to improving expression and stability of neuraminidase by grafting antigenic surface loops from low-expressing neuraminidase proteins onto high-expressing strains. We generated hybrid proteins bearing the antigenic properties of the loop donor accompanied by the favourable expression, stability, and tetrameric structure of the loop recipient. The hybrid neuraminidase proteins were recognised by a broad set of human monoclonal antibodies induced by influenza infection or vaccination, and grafted loops were superposable in their X-ray structures. Immunisation of mice with neuraminidase hybrids induced inhibitory antibodies to the loop donor and protected against lethal influenza challenge. This pragmatic technique enables improved expression of influenza neuraminidase proteins for vaccine manufacture."
Immunological Profiling in Knee Osteoarthritis: Treg Dysfunction as Key Driver of Pain,"Marie,Johanna,Maria,Paul,Fabien,Alexandra,Michele,Signe,Roberta,Claire,Vanessa,Helene,Leslie,Pierre,Nicolas,Kenz,Caroline,Alice,Lise,Atul J,Adrien,Michelle,Nicolas,Francis,David,Encarnita,Jeremie,Marie,Johanna,Maria,Paul,Fabien,Alexandra,Michele,Signe,Roberta,Claire,Vanessa,Helene,Leslie,Pierre,Nicolas,Kenz,Caroline,Alice,Lise,Atul J,Adrien,Michelle,Nicolas,Francis,David,Encarnita,Jeremie,Marie,Johanna,Maria,Paul,Fabien,Alexandra,Michele,Signe,Roberta,Claire,Vanessa,Helene,Leslie,Pierre,Nicolas,Kenz,Caroline,Alice,Lise,Atul J,Adrien,Michelle,Nicolas,Francis,David,Encarnita,Jeremie","Pain is the hallmark symptom of osteoarthritis (OA) and its biological drivers remain poorly understood. While the role of innate immunity in OA has been extensively studied, the involvement of adaptive immunity, in particular regulatory T cells (Tregs), is not well understood. Using a comprehensive multi-omic approach on the peripheral blood from 46 knee OA patients with similar radiographic stage, including deep immunophenotyping, cytokine profiling, transcriptomic and T-cell receptor analysis on sorted CD4 Tregs and effector T cells (Teffs), we identified an immunological signature associated with OA-related pain. Cytokines promoting Treg expansion and activation (with increases of sIL2-RA, sTNFR1, sTNFR2) were correlated with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscore, suggesting a potential Treg dysfunction. Nineteen T cell subsets were correlated with WOMAC pain. Notably, we found a negative correlation of cell subsets associated with Treg expansion and activation (FoxP3+CTLA4+, CD4+CD57+, Treg CD95+, CD4 Treg CD45RA-). Differential gene expression analysis between patients with low and high WOMAC pain intensity (threshold of 40/100) revealed an upregulation of inflammasome-related genes such as IL1RL1, IL31RA, IFITM3, NLRP3, IFNG in Tregs. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted an overrepresentation of innate immune response, IL-8, and interferon activation pathways suggesting a pro-inflammatory state in Tregs of patients with high pain intensity. Collectively, our systems immunology approach highlights multiple associations between Treg dysfunctionality and OA-related pain, providing new insights into the adaptive immune system's contribution to OA-related pain."

In vivo labeling approaches using radiotracers primarily show CD8, T cell distributions, while ex vivo labeled CD8, T cells can show CD8, T cell migration patterns, homing, and tumor infiltration. Currently, a comprehensive head-to-head comparison of in vivo and ex- vivo cell labeling with respect to their tumor and normal tissue targeting properties and correlation to the presence of CD8, T cells is lacking, yet essential for correct interpretation of clinical CD8, imaging applications. Therefore, we performed a head-to-head comparison of three different CD8, T cell imaging approaches: 1) ,Zr-labeled DFO-conjugated Fc-silent anti-CD8 antibody ([,Zr]Zr-anti-CD8-IgG2a,), 2) ex vivo ,Zr-oxine labeled ovalbumin-specific CD8, T cells ([,Zr]Zr-OT-I cells), and 3) ,F-labeled IL2 ([,F]AlF-RESCA-IL2).
Methods
B16F10/OVA tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice (n=10/group) received intravenously one of the three radiopharmaceuticals. PET/CT images were acquired starting 72 h ([,Zr]Zr-anti-CD8-IgG2a,), 24 and 48 h ([,Zr]Zr-OT-I cells), and 10 min ([,F]AlF-RESCA-IL2) post injection. Subsequently, ex vivo biodistribution analysis of the radiopharmaceuticals was performed followed by flow cytometric analysis to evaluate the number of intratumoral CD8, T cells. Additionally, the intratumoral radiolabel distributions was assessed by autoradiography and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tumor slices.
Results
[,Zr]Zr-anti-CD8-IgG2a,, [,Zr]Zr-OT-I cells, and [,F]AlF-RESCA-IL2 showed uptake in CD8-rich tissues, with preferential targeting to the spleen. Biodistribution analysis showed tumor uptake above blood level for all radiopharmaceuticals, except [,F]AlF-RESCA-IL2. For all three approaches, the uptake in the tumor-draining lymph node was significantly higher compared with the contralateral axial lymph node, suggesting that all approaches allow evaluation of immune responses involving CD8, T cells. Tumor uptake of [,Zr]Zr-anti-CD8-IgG2a, (R,=0.65, p<0.01) and [,Zr]Zr-OT-I cells (R,=0.74, p<0.01) correlated to the number of intratumoral CD8, T cells (flow cytometry). The intratumoral distribution pattern of the radiosignal was different for ex vivo and in vivo radiolabeling techniques. The short half-life of ,F precluded autoradiography assessment of [,F]AlF-RESCA-IL2.
Conclusion
We show that [,Zr]Zr-anti-CD8-IgG2a, and [,Zr]Zr-OT-I cells PET/CT imaging can be used to evaluate intratumoral CD8, T cells, even though their normal tissues and intratumoral distribution patterns are significantly different. Based on their characteristics, [,Zr]Zr-anti-CD8-IgG2a, might be most useful to immunophenotyping the TME, while the ex vivo cell labeling approach visualizes CD8, T cell migrations patterns and the permissiveness of tumors for invasion, whereas [,F]AlF-RESCA-IL2 allows for rapid recurrent imaging and might prove useful for tracking rapid changes in CD8, T cell distributions. In conclusion, our head-to-head comparison of the three prototype CD8, T cell labeling approaches provides new insights which can aid in correct interpretation of clinical CD8 imaging and may guide in the selection of the optimal imaging approach for the research question of interest."
nsGSLs on tumors impair anti-tumor immune responses by OT-I T cells in vitro and support tumor growth in vivo,"Tamara,Aimee A.F.,Nordin D.,Tao,Manfred,Robbert M.,S. Marieke,Tamara,Aimee A.F.,Nordin D.,Tao,Manfred,Robbert M.,S. Marieke,Tamara,Aimee A.F.,Nordin D.,Tao,Manfred,Robbert M.,S. Marieke","Tumors often evolve to engage numerous strategies to circumvent detection by the immune system. Our group recently discovered elevated neolacto-series glycosphingolipids (nsGSL) surface levels as a possible immune evasion mechanism of tumors. We demonstrated a direct disruption of both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity in vitro when expression of nsGSLs was upregulated on established target cells. It remains unclear however, whether in vivo nsGSLs play an active role in tumor development and can aid tumors in evading immune responses. To investigate whether nsGSLs facilitate tumor progression in vivo, we first established a murine model system using MC38-OVA cell lines with varying cell surface levels of nsGSLs. In vitro analysis revealed reduced MHC-I accessibility on tumor cells with elevated nsGSLs profiles, leading to diminished activation of OVA-specific OT-I T cells as evidenced by decreased expression of CD25, CD69, and production of IFNg, which subsequently resulted in decreased tumor cell death. Subsequent in vivo experiments investigating tumor outgrowth after engraftment of subcutaneously injected MC38-OVA cell lines with low or high cell surface levels of nsGSLs demonstrated better growth of nsGSL-rich tumor cells compared to nsGSL-poor tumors which could be controlled. Together these results suggest that nsGSLs expressed by tumors can facilitate immune evasion and subsequent tumor progression. These data pave the way to explore whether targeting of the GSL pathway with specific inhibitors could be advantageous as a therapy against tumors with high nsGSL levels."

Compared to the sequence-based tools heavily trained with human ligandome, AF-pred does not show an advantage in predicting the binding patterns of human HLA-II but has far better performance in predicting the binding patterns of other animals' MHC-II. Using recently resolved bat MHC-II structures, we analyzed AF-pred's prediction capability, logic, and limitation. In addition, we also explored the impact of AF algorithm iterations on the prediction of MHC-II restricted epitopes. The results demonstrated that AF-pred is capable of cross-species prediction of MHC-II restricted epitopes and is conducive to the development of novel veterinary vaccines."

We aimed to identify its cellular source in synovial tissue from patients with Axial SpA (AxSpA) and Psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Methods: Synovial tissue from patients with SpA was profiled using single-cell RNA sequencing(scRNA-seq: AxSpA, n=5 and PsA, n=6) or spatial RNA profiling (PsA, n=4). CellPhoneDB was used to infer cell-cell communication. Tissue resident memory Th17 (TRM17)-like cells were generated in vitro using blood memory CD4+ T cells from SpA patients. An epigenetic inhibitor library, siRNA and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) were used to identify epigenetic regulator(s) for TRM17. Results: scRNA-seq showed that IL-17A expression in SpA synovium was restricted to CD4+CXCR6+ TRM17 cells. Cell-cell communication and single-cell spatial analysis support the interaction between TRM17 and CLEC10A+ dendritic cells, which were activated in SpA. Both sublining and lining fibroblasts in SpA synovium exhibited an enhanced IL-17A response signature. TRM17-like cells generated in vitro phenocopied the TRM17 found in joint tissue and produced IL-17A in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation but not cytokines. IL-23 enhanced TCR-mediated IL-17F and IFN-gamma; but not IL-17A production. Perturbation of BRD1 inhibited the generation of TRM17-like cells. Conclusions: CD4+ TRM17 cells are the predominant source of IL-17A in SpA. The TCR stimulation is essential for the secretion of IL-17A by TRM17-like cells. The epigenetic regulator BRD1 contributes to the generation of TRM17. Depleting TRM17 cells in SpA is a therapeutic strategy with potential to induce longterm remission."
GRASP55 Regulates Sorting and Maturation of the Lysosomal Enzyme β-Hexosaminidase A,"Sarah R,Aadil,Sarah,Alissa,Yanzhuang,Sarah R,Aadil,Sarah,Alissa,Yanzhuang,Sarah R,Aadil,Sarah,Alissa,Yanzhuang","The Golgi apparatus plays a crucial role in the delivery of lysosomal enzymes. Golgi Reassembly Stacking Proteins, GRASP55 and GRASP65, are vital for maintaining Golgi structure and function. GRASP55 depletion results in the missorting and secretion of the lysosomal enzyme Cathepsin D (Xiang et al., 2013), though the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we conducted secretomic analyses of GRASP55 knockout (KO) cells and found a significant increase in lysosome-associated proteins in the extracellular medium. Using the lysosomal beta-hexosaminidase subunit alpha (HEXA) as a model, we found that GRASP55 depletion disrupted normal trafficking and processing of HEXA, resulting in increased secretion of the immature (pro-form) HEXA into the extracellular milieu, along with decreased levels of the mature form and enzymatic activity within the cell. GRASP55 depletion significantly reduced the complex formation between HEXA and mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptors (MPR), despite no overall change in MPR expression. And finally, we found there was a notable reduction in the expression of GNPTAB, leading to a reduction in M6P modification of HEXA, hindering its efficient targeting to lysosomes. These findings reveal the role of GRASP55 in regulating lysosomal enzyme dynamics, emphasizing its role in the sorting and trafficking of lysosomal proteins."

Understanding how a ,-regulatory landscape integrates information from many dynamically expressed TFs has remained a challenge. We develop a combined CRISPR-screening approach using endogenous RNA and RE-reporters as readouts. Applied to the , locus, crucial for X-chromosome inactivation in females, this method allows us to comprehensively identify Xist-controlling TFs and map their TF-RE wiring. We find a group of transiently expressed TFs that regulate proximal REs, driving the binary activation of Xist expression. These basal activators are more highly expressed in cells with two X chromosomes, potentially driving female-specific Xist upregulation. A second set of developmental TFs is upregulated later during differentiation and targets distal REs. This regulatory axis is crucial to achieve high levels of Xist RNA, which is necessary for X-chromosome inactivation. Our findings support a model for developmental gene regulation in which factors targeting proximal REs drive binary ON-OFF decisions, while factors interacting with distal REs control the transcription output."
The Integrated Stress Response Suppresses PINK1-dependent Mitophagy by Preserving Mitochondrial Import Efficiency,"Mingchong,Zengshuo,Kelly,Wen,Xiaoyan,Mingchong,Zengshuo,Kelly,Wen,Xiaoyan,Mingchong,Zengshuo,Kelly,Wen,Xiaoyan","Mitophagy is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial health, but how its levels adjust to different stress conditions remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of the DELE1-HRI axis of integrated stress response (ISR) in regulating mitophagy, a key mitochondrial stress pathway. Our findings show that the ISR suppresses mitophagy under non-depolarizing mitochondrial stress by positively regulating mitochondrial protein import, independent of ATF4 activation. Mitochondrial protein import is regulated by the rate of protein synthesis under both depolarizing and non-depolarizing stress. Without ISR, increased protein synthesis overwhelms the mitochondrial import machinery, reducing its efficiency. Under depolarizing stress, mitochondrial import is heavily impaired even with active ISR, leading to significant PINK1 accumulation. In contrast, non-depolarizing stress allows more efficient protein import in the presence of ISR, resulting in lower mitophagy. Without ISR, mitochondrial protein import becomes severely compromised, causing PINK1 accumulation to reach the threshold necessary to trigger mitophagy. These findings reveal a novel link between ISR-regulated protein synthesis, mitochondrial import, and mitophagy, offering potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction."
"Novel antibodies detect nucleocytoplasmic O-fucose in protist pathogens, cellular slime molds, and plants","Megna,Elisabet,Manish,Marla,Kenjiroo,Marianne,Ralph,Robert S,Neil E,Ron,John,Christopher M,Megna,Elisabet,Manish,Marla,Kenjiroo,Marianne,Ralph,Robert S,Neil E,Ron,John,Christopher M,Megna,Elisabet,Manish,Marla,Kenjiroo,Marianne,Ralph,Robert S,Neil E,Ron,John,Christopher M","Cellular adaptations to change often involve post-translational modifications of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. An example found in protists and plants is the modification of serine and threonine residues of dozens to hundreds of nucleocytoplasmic proteins with a single fucose (O-Fuc). A nucleocytoplasmic O-fucosyltransferase (OFT) occurs in the pathogen Toxoplasma gondii, the social amoeba Dictyostelium, and higher plants, where it is called Spy because mutants have a spindly appearance. O-fucosylation, which is required for optimal proliferation of Toxoplasma and Dictyostelium, is paralogous to the O-GlcNAcylation of nucleocytoplasmic proteins of plants and animals that is involved in stress and nutritional responses. O-Fuc was first discovered in Toxoplasma using Aleuria aurantia lectin, but its broad specificity for terminal fucose residues on N- and O-linked glycans in the secretory pathway limits its use. Here we present affinity purified rabbit antisera that are selective for the detection and enrichment of proteins bearing fucose-O-Ser or fucose-O-Thr. These antibodies detect numerous nucleocytoplasmic proteins in Toxoplasma, Dictyostelium, and Arabidopsis, as well as O-Fuc occurring on secretory proteins of mammalian and Dictyostelium cells, although the latter are sometimes capped by further glycosylation. The antibodies label Toxoplasma, Acanthamoeba, and Dictyostelium  in a pattern reminiscent of O-GlcNAc in animal cells including nuclear pores. The O-fucome of Dictyostelium is partially conserved with that of Toxoplasma and is highly induced during starvation-induced development. These antisera demonstrate the unique antigenicity of O-Fuc, document conservation of the O-fucome among unrelated protists, and will enable the study of the O-fucomes of other organisms possessing OFT-like genes."
A role for class I PAKs in the regulation of the excitability of the actin cytoskeleton.,"Joe J,Anthony,Megan E,Montserrat Llanses,Pete J,Jason S.,Vassilis,Joe J,Anthony,Megan E,Montserrat Llanses,Pete J,Jason S.,Vassilis,Joe J,Anthony,Megan E,Montserrat Llanses,Pete J,Jason S.,Vassilis","P21 activated kinases (PAKs) are involved in a wide range of functions from the regulation of the cytoskeleton to the control of apoptosis and proliferation. Although many PAK substrates identified are implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a coherent picture of the total effect of PAK activation on the state of the actin cytoskeleton is unclear. We therefore set out to observe and quantify the effect of PAK inhibition on the actin cytoskeleton in greater detail. In Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts, inhibition of PAK kinase activity, either by treatment with small molecule inhibitors or overexpression of mutant PAK constructs leads to the constitutive production of patches of the phosphoinositide PIP3 on the ventral surface of the cell. The formation of these patches remodels the actin cytoskeleton and polarises the cell. From the overexpression of truncated and mutant PAK constructs as well as an in vitro model of PAK recruitment to small GTPases we propose that this is due to a hyper recruitment of PAK and PAK binding partners in the absence of PAK kinase activity. This aberrant production of PIP3 suggests that the kinase activity of class I PAKs acts to downregulate PI3K activity further highlighting class I PAKs as regulators of PI3K activity and therefore the excitability of the actin cytoskeleton."

Building on our prior research establishing nuclear speckles as a pivotal membrane-less organelle responsible for global proteostasis transcriptional control, we aim to alleviate proteinopathies through nuclear speckle rejuvenation. We identified pyrvinium pamoate as a small-molecule nuclear speckle rejuvenator that enhances protein quality control while suppressing YAP1 signaling via decreasing the surface/interfacial tension of nuclear speckle condensates through interaction with the intrinsically disordered region of nuclear speckle scaffold protein SON. In pre-clinical models, nanomolar pyrvinium pamoate alleviated retina degeneration and reduced tauopathy by promoting autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome system in a SON-dependent manner without causing cellular stress. Aberrant nuclear speckle morphology, reduced protein quality control and increased YAP1 activity were also observed in human tauopathies. Our study uncovers novel therapeutic targets for tackling protein misfolding disorders within an expanded proteostasis framework encompassing nuclear speckles and YAP1."

Here we analyse a hippopotamus femur consumed by an extinct species of giant hyena, recovered from the open-air site Fuente Nueva 3 (∼1.2 Ma, Orce, Granada, Spain). Leveraging the use of advanced microscopic techniques to digitise the tooth marks observed on this specimen in three dimensions, the present study utilises artificially intelligent algorithms to then simulate the possible morphological variability of this carnivoran. This allows us to characterise , tooth pit morphology, so as to construct a diagnostic reference sample of this species.

Origin of division of labor is decoupled from polymorphism in colonial animals,"Sarah,Stewart M.,Rebecca,Carl,Sarah,Stewart M.,Rebecca,Carl,Sarah,Stewart M.,Rebecca,Carl","Division of labor, the specialization of sometimes phenotypically divergent cell types or group members, is often associated with ecological success in eukaryotic colonial organisms. Despite its many independent evolutionary origins, how division of labor originates remains unclear. Conventional hypotheses tend towards an “economic” model, so that biological division of labor may reflect a partitioning of pre-existing tasks and morphologies into specialized colony members. Here, we present an alternative model of the origin of division of labor, which can explain the evolution of new functions within a colony. We show that in colonies of the Cretaceous aged (103-96 Ma) fossil bryozoan of the genus ,, the first cheilostome bryozoan to evolve polymorphism, new member morphologies were not a simple partitioning of pre-existing morphologies, but instead expanded into novel morphospace as they lost functions, specifically feeding. This expansion into new morphologies occurred primarily during two pulses of heightened morphological disparity, suggesting that the evolution of polymorphism corresponded to relaxed constraints on morphology and perhaps to the exploration of novel functions. Using a simple model of physiological connections, we show that regardless of the functionality of these new colony members, all non-feeding members could have been supported by neighboring feeding members. This suggests that the geometric constraints and physiological connectedness could be prerequisites for evolving both polymorphism and division of labor in modular organisms, and that a classic partitioning model of specialization cannot be broadly applied to biological systems."
Evolutionary paleoecology of European rhinocerotids across the Oligocene-Miocene transition,"Manon,Céline,Cécile,Damien,Gertrud E.,Manon,Céline,Cécile,Damien,Gertrud E.,Manon,Céline,Cécile,Damien,Gertrud E.","The Oligocene-Miocene transition witnessed great environmental and faunal changes, spanning from late Oligocene to early Miocene (MP28-MN3). Its drivers and consequences on mammals are however poorly understood. Rhinocerotoids are among the most affected taxa, reflected by great taxonomical and morphological changes. However, potential associated changes in ecology have not been explored. Here, we investigated the paleoecology of 10 rhinocerotid species coming from 15 localities across Western Europe and ranging from MP28 to MN3. We explored evolutionary trends for diet, physiology, and habitat via dental wear, hypoplasia, body mass, and stable isotopy. All rhinocerotids studied were C3 feeders, whether browsing or mixed-feeding, but clear dietary differences were observed at some localities and between Oligocene and Miocene rhinocerotids. The prevalence of hypoplasia was low (< 10 %) to moderate (< 20 %), but there were great differences by loci, species, and localities. Body mass co-variated with hypoplasia prevalence, suggesting that larger species might be more susceptible to stresses and environmental changes. We reconstructed similar warm conditions at all localities except Gaimersheim, but found greater variations in precipitation. Indeed, a clear shift in δ,C values was noticed at the end of the Oligocene, consistent with climatic and vegetation changes reported at that time."
An extinct clade sister to Eumetazoa: On the phylogeny of the Cambrian chancelloriids,"Hao,Xingliang,Glenn A.,Jian,Luoyang,Bing,Guoxiang,Joachim,Hao,Xingliang,Glenn A.,Jian,Luoyang,Bing,Guoxiang,Joachim,Hao,Xingliang,Glenn A.,Jian,Luoyang,Bing,Guoxiang,Joachim","The notable disparity of animal body plans can be traced back to the morphological innovations during the Cambrian explosion and represented by a number of exceptionally preserved soft-bodied and skeletal fossils that provide a compelling narrative for animal evolution. Chancelloriids, one of the extinct groups of Cambrian animals, have a distinctive body that characterized by a sclerite-bearing, flexible integument and a single apical opening leading into a central cavity devoid of unequivocal internal organs. Their phylogenetic position within the Metazoa, however, is controversial. Here, we describe new soft-bodied fossils of chancelloriids from the 518-million-year-old Chengjiang biota of China, which corroborate the unique bauplan pattern and reveal exquisite integument microstructures. The tiny protuberances and wrinkling structures of the integument are interpreted to be related to primitive epithelial contraction, suggesting that chancelloriids were a group of basal epitheliozoans and constitute an evolutionary clade that branched below all extant eumetazoans while above or close to the placozoans. Thus, the chancelloriid body plan likely filled one of the anatomical gaps between the Placozoa and the Eumetazoa."

Mitotic spindle orientation and dynamics are fine-tuned by anisotropic tissue stretch via NuMA localisation,"Nawseen,Dionn,Dessislava,Georgina K,Oliver E.,Sarah,Nawseen,Dionn,Dessislava,Georgina K,Oliver E.,Sarah,Nawseen,Dionn,Dessislava,Georgina K,Oliver E.,Sarah","Cell division orientation, which is key to cell fate and shaping tissues, is influenced by mechanical forces. For example, in uniaxially stretched tissue most divisions orient along the stretch axis. This mechanosensitive division orientation can be achieved by distinct mechanisms involving a direct response to force or an indirect response to force via cell shape changes. Cells also generally align divisions along their long axis of interphase shape. Since stretching a tissue elongates cells, uncoupling whether divisions orient in response to force or to cell shape remains challenging. Here, we utilised the Xenopus laevis embryonic animal cap tissue, to which a reproducible external stretch can be applied, to understand mechanosensitive division orientation. We focused on nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA), which is key to spindle orientation. We show that NuMA is dynamically localised to the cell cortex earlier during mitosis in uniaxially stretched tissues. This temporal cortical recruitment of NuMA coincides with the onset and subsequent stretch-induced amplification of spindle oscillations. Additionally, we show that knockdown of NuMA reduces spindle oscillations and disrupts division orientation according to stretch and cell shape. We also show that divisions dynamically align with cell shape under tissue stretch and that this involves a direct response to force via NuMA localisation, rather than an indirect response to force via cell shape changes. Overall, using live tissue imaging, mathematical modelling, and tissue mechanics our results indicate that NuMA fine tunes spindle dynamics and ensures the accurate alignment of divisions with cell shape and anisotropic tension."

Dysregulation of lipid metabolism is linked to disease states such as cancer and neurodegeneration. However, limited tools are available for quantifying metabolic fluxes across the lipidome. To directly measure reaction fluxes encompassing compound lipid homeostasis, we applied stable isotope tracing, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and network-based isotopologue modeling to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) models. Compound lipid metabolic flux analysis (CL-MFA) enables the concurrent quantitation of fatty acid synthesis, elongation, headgroup assembly, and salvage reactions within virtually any biological system. Here, we resolve liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-mediated regulation of sphingolipid recycling in NSCLC cells and precision-cut lung slice cultures. We also demonstrate that widely used tissue culture conditions drive cells to upregulate fatty acid synthase flux to supraphysiological levels. Finally, we identify previously uncharacterized isozyme specificity of ceramide synthase inhibitors, highlighting the molecular detail revealed by CL-MFA."

In addition to their lack of alloreactivity, γδ T cells exhibit properties distinct from other lymphocyte subsets, prompting significant interest in their development as an off-the-shelf cellular immunotherapeutic. However, their low abundance in circulation, heterogeneity, limited methods for ex vivo expansion, and under-developed methodologies for genetic modification have hindered basic study and clinical application of γδ T cells. Here, we implement a feeder-free, scalable approach for ex vivo manufacture of polyclonal, non-virally modified, gene edited chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-γδ T cells in support of therapeutic application. Engineered CAR-γδ T cells demonstrate high function in vitro and and in vivo. Longitudinal in vivo pharmacokinetic profiling of adoptively transferred polyclonal CAR-γδ T cells uncover subset-specific responses to IL-15 cytokine armoring and multiplex base editing. Our results present a robust platform for genetic modification of polyclonal CAR-γδ T cells and present unique opportunities to further define synergy and the contribution of discrete, engineered CAR-γδ T cell subsets to therapeutic efficacy in vivo."

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has accelerated the characterization of cellular phenotypes in the pig respiratory tract under both healthy and diseased conditions. However, combining scRNAseq with recovery of paired T cell receptor (TCR) α and β chains as well as B cell receptor (BCR) heavy and light chains to interrogate their repertoires has not to our knowledge been demonstrated for pigs. Here, we developed primers to enrich porcine TCR α and β chains along with BCR κ and β light chains and IgM, IgA, and IgG heavy chains that are compatible with the 10x Genomics VDJ sequencing protocol. Using these pig-specific assays, we sequenced the T and B cell receptors of cryopreserved lung cells from CD1D-expressing and -deficient pigs after one or two infections with influenza A virus (IAV) to examine whether natural killer T (NKT) cells alter pulmonary TCR and BCR repertoire selection. We also performed paired single-cell RNA and receptor sequencing of FACS-sorted T cells longitudinally sampled from the lungs of IAV-vaccinated and -infected pigs to track clonal expansion in response to IAV exposure. All pigs presented highly diverse repertoires. Pigs re-exposed to influenza antigens from either vaccination or infection exhibited higher numbers of expanded CD4 and CD8 T cell clonotypes with activated phenotypes, suggesting potential IAV reactive T cell populations. Our results demonstrate the utility of high throughput single-cell TCR and BCR sequencing in pigs."

In two areas within the Hill Antechamber and the Dinaledi Chamber this work uncovered concentrations of abundant , fossils including articulated, matrix-supported skeletal regions consistent with rapid covering by sediment prior to the decomposition of soft tissue. We additionally re-examine the spatial positioning of skeletal material and associated sediments within the Puzzle Box area, from which abundant , remains representing a minimum of six individuals were recovered in 2013 and 2014. Multiple lines of evidence exclude the hypothesis that skeletal remains from these three areas come from bodies that decomposed on the floor of the chamber or within a shallow depression prior to burial by sediments. The spatial positioning of skeletal material, the topography of the subsystem, and observations on sediments within and surrounding features exclude the hypothesis that rapid burial by sediment was a result of gravity-driven slumping or spontaneous movement of sediments.

Previous stable oxygen isotope studies suggested that several taxa belonging to these groups were endothermic and for some of them homeothermic organisms. However, these conclusions remain contentious owing to the associated uncertainties regarding the δ,O value and oxygen isotope fractionation relative to environmental sea water. Here, we present new hydroxylapatite phosphate δ,O values (δ,O,) of Ichthyosauria, Plesiosauria and Metriorhynchidae (Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous) recovered from mid- to high-paleolatitudes to better constrain their thermophysiology and investigate the presence of regional heterothermies. The intra-skeletal δ,O, variability failed to reveal distinct heterothermic patterns within any of the specimens, indicating either intra-body temperature homogeneity or an overriding diagenetic overprint of the original biological δ,O, bone record. Body temperature estimates have then been reassessed from new and published δ,O, values of well-preserved isolated teeth, recently revised Mesozoic latitudinal δ,O oceanic gradient and ,O-enrichment factor of fully aquatic air-breathing vertebrates. Our results confirm that Ichthyosauria were homeothermic endotherms (31°C to 41°C), while Plesiosauria were likely poikilothermic endotherms (27°C to 34°C). The new body temperature estimates of the Metriorhynchidae (25°C to 32°C) closely follow ambient temperatures and point to poikilothermic strategy with no or little endothermic abilities. These results improve our understanding of Mesozoic marine reptile thermoregulation and indicate that due to their limited body temperature variations, the δ,O, values from Ichthyosauria fossil remains could be used as valuable archives of Mesozoic oceans δ,O, values that may help improve palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic reconstructions."
